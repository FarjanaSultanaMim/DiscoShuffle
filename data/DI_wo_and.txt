it should also be noted
in my point of view
it can be said that
in order to decide whether
i would like to emphasize
i agree in principle, but
i am not absolutely sure 
it used to be thought   
i would have to argue that
is due to the fact that
i would reaffirm my position that
i agree with the statement that
in my personal point of view
it may be the case that
it could also be said that
it is important to note however
i do not agree with this statement
i would like to point out that
i have every reason to believe that 
i am of exactly the same opinion
i would like to support this view 
i see things rather differently myself 
i am not at all convinced that
