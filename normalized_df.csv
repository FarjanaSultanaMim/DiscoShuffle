It is time, that our society is dominated by industrialization. The prosperity of a country is based on its enormous industrial corporations that are gradually replacing men with machines. Science is highly developed and controls the economy. From the beginning of school life students are expected to master a huge amount of scientific data. Technology is part of our everyday life.
Children nowadays prefer to play with computers rather than with our parents' wooden toys. But I think that in our modern world which worships science and technology there is still a place for dreams and imagination.
There has always been a place for them in man's life. Even in the darkness of the Middle Ages when religion confined the human mind in the cage of its dogmas, men dreamt of a better life.
They dreamt of exploring the unknown depths of earth and sea, of flying into the sky and reaching the stars. Step by step society has freed itself from the restrictions of religion and science has become the dominant power. Nowadays some people see in its dominance a threat to man's inclination to dreaming. But man could dream in the darkest past, so why could he not dream now?
Man has always dreamt of going beyond the world he knew. Science has made the unknown world too small but man keeps on dreaming. He turns to books to find his new inspiration. People nowadays read not less than they did in the past. Besides they still create literature which means they are still capable of creating new imaginary worlds. People still use their imagination to paint pictures and to compose music. Art is still alive. And society feels necessity for this art because people enjoy escaping to other worlds, even if they are not real.
Moreover, I cannot imagine that people have lost their ability of creative thinking. People have always had the gift of imagination. I cannot agree with the statement that because of the dominance of science and technology, there is no place for this gift. How would all the technological achievements and scientific breakthroughs been made, if man had not used his imagination? It is because of his imagination and his constant dreaming that man has achieved so much in science. The fact that science never stops developing is a proof that man never stops using his imagination.
I am sure that man keeps on dreaming. There is not much space left to be explored but in every field of human life there will always be some kind of a frontier and people will always dream of going beyond it. Maybe industry has taken the place of nature and maybe romanticism is dead but psychologists go on asking the question: ""Whom or what would you like to take with you on a lonely island?"" And people go on dreaming that they will spend their lives like Robinson Crusoe with their favourite show-business star, or favourite pet or book but not with their personal computer.

BGSU1002,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,Most University degrees are theoretical and do not prepare us for the real life. Do you agree or disagree?,"
Nowadays there is a growing interest in higher education and almost every young person wishes to have a university diploma. I would not say that university degrees are useless; of course, they have their value but I think that the university courses are rather theoretical. They do not prepare students for the real life outside the university walls. The courses deal mainly with theoretical problems and general concepts. The specialization begins quite late, the practice is inadequate and is not always up to the requirements that real work will set to the students after they leave the university.
In my opinion most of the courses taken by first and second year students aim at acquiring general knowledge, instead of specialized which the students will need in their later study and work. General knowledge is not a bad thing in principle but sometimes it turns into a mere waste of time. I could point out as an example the course in Latin I took last year. I must say I have forgotten everything I once knew, just because I think I will never need Latin in my future work.
So, is it not more useful to spend a year studying a modern language?
Besides being oriented towards general knowledge some of the courses are too theoretical. A
good example is the course in Informatics that first year students take.Computers are becoming more and more important in our life and today every educated person is expected to be able to work with computers.The university course, however, dealt more with theoretical problems rather than with actual computer skills. The lectures we had were quite useless for people with no technical education and instead of trying to memorize incomprehensible data we could have spent more time working with the computers.
Another problem that students of foreign philologies are confronted with is the lack of opportunity to practice the language in a country where it is spoken. Students in law and medicine, for example, have one year of practice before starting work but students in philology do not have many chances to live and study abroad. Something that puzzles me when speaking about practice, is the fact that you can specialize in literature, linguistics or translation but you have compulsory practice in teaching. This practice is obviously of no importance to students who have no intention of becoming teachers.
In my opinion university education deals with too much theory and not enough practice. Students have to study subjects which are not closely related to the subject they want to specialize in. They have to study in details how things are done but sometimes they do not have the opportunity to do them themselves. That is why some students feel that the university does not prepare them for real life. Moreover, young people can see examples of men who have succeeded in their business and in life in general without university degrees, which is a kind of a proof of the saying that life is the best teacher.

BGSU1003,2.5,2.5,,,,,"Some people say that in our modern world, dominated by science and technology and industrialisation, there is no longer a place for dreaming and imagination. What is your opinion?","
Once upon a time there lived a beautiful young lady and a handsome young gentleman. They were in love and wanted to get married but their parents objected to the marriage because they were very poor. They said that they would allow them to marry when they got good jobs with good prospects. So the young people waited until they got good jobs with good prospects and got married. But they were still poor and did not have any house to live in. But large organization lent them money to buy a house with all the latest electrical appliances and furniture. They even managed to pay off their debts and to insure their lives and property in some prosperous insurance companies such as SIC or VIS-2. The young couple lived happily for the rest of their life. And so ends another modern romantic fable.
Who tells you that in our modern world dominated by science, technology and industrialization, there is no longer a place for dreaming and imagination. Our materialistic society trains us from childhood to be acquisitive. We acquire knowledge, skills of money making, we acquire even knowledge of how to dream and imagine. Any other form of imagination that the materialistic one is looked on as a fable or a fairy tale. We do not believe in things which we cannot touch with our own hands or see with our eyes. Science and industrialization teach us that there is no God. One should believe only in material possessions that are real and not imaginary. Success is measured in terms of the money we earn or on the basis of our achievements in science, technology and industrialization.
""Science and technology"" is the future religion of the world. If it says that there is no place for dreaming then one should lock up his imagination and restrict his dreams to the sphere of making more money.
It is not only in affluent societies that people are obsessed with the idea of making more money.
Consumer goods are needed everywhere and modern industry deliberately sets out to create new markets. Goods are made not to last forever. You no sooner buy a new product than you are thinking about its replacement. ""Mammon"" as Carlyle names the industrial world has spread out its influence everywhere as an octopus spreads out its tentacles. While Mammon is worshipped and the Gospel of Mammomism is obeyed as never before, the rich get richer and the poor poorer.
The industrial outlook has seriously influenced education. Its effect is so powerful that students are left without any hope for dreaming and imagination. Fewer and fewer students acquire knowledge for the sake of studying. Every course of study must lead to fields in the sphere of science, technology or industry. Even to literature is given scientific explanation. The supply of skilled personnel far exceeds the demand but people are still taught to think that more and more pioneers in the sphere of science are needed. recruiting tactics of different companies have led to the ""brain drain"", the process of which skilled people offer their services to the highest bidder.
Workaholism has deprived young people of any imagination or dreaming.
Our industrial world also tries to organize some sort of social orderlines out of apparently inevitable chaos. A lot of -isms are discussed nowadays - individualism, liberalism, pluralism, nationalism, utilitarianism. Even some sort of new moralism is imposed on modern man.
However, while some people are in a hurry to organize their lives at the expense of others, they do not realize that time passes quickly. While they are trying to adapt means to ends "" they themselves are becoming slaves to the power that they want to exert. People become means for the fulfillment of that old prophets and wiser men have foreseen and prophesied.
""In the last days perilous times shall came. For men shall be lovers of their own selves, covetous, bosters ...""
All these things are tone Industrial societies run the risk of being caged in mechanism and people are becoming merely the sum of mechanical processes. They are conditioned to ask only the ""answerable"" questions.
What becomes with the romance fable. They paid off their debts and lived happily for the rest of their lives. Why did they live happily? Because they possessed all the latest electronic appliances. What happened when they died? This is a question without an answer. It spoils the whole story. Yet the story ends up happily. But does this happiness last forever? It is limited in time. What is happiness then? I'd better not ask any more questions or I run the risk of spoiling this modern romance fable.

BGSU1004,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,2.5,3.5,Most University degrees are theoretical and do not prepare us for the real life. Do you agree or disagree?,"
Our educational system in one of the largest in the world. It offers variety, diversity but not flexibility and value for money. This is due to the fact that many of our university degree courses are either illegal or award the students with jobless future. They do not motivate students to make further research Undergraduates are looking forward to receive their degrees for the sake of some future reward.
University degrees are necessary in out materialistic society. However degree levels in vocational subjects, such as art and design, engineering, business studies, and hotel and catering, do not have a future. The role of university degrees has been replaced by the fact that they tell you nothing about a person's true ability and aptitude. They are mark either of success or failure.
Furthermore they are theoretical and do not prepare students for real life.
A good education should, among other things, train you to think for yourself. The examination system does anything but that. What has to be learnt is laid down by a syllabus and students are encouraged to memorize. Examinations do not motivate students to make research and read widely, they induce studying for marks instead. They lower the standards of teaching and lead to theoretical degrees that are designed to be put in a frame and to serve as souvenirs.
The most successful Bachelors and Masters or PhDs are not always the best educated. They are the best trained in the technique of working under stress. They live in a world of vicious competition where success and failure are measured. University degrees do anything but prepare them for this competition. They do not prepare students to think for themselves and make their own research on a given subject. They put restrictions to their sphere of knowledge and do not give them any opportunity to widen the already existing theory or amend some of the old things and add some new information.
Degrees which can be completed in a shorter period of time, the so called ""fast-track"" degree courses are even less practically oriented. Standards are rigorous yet students tend to memorize information and creative work is left behind. Another important point that should be made is the fact that many ""fast-track"" degree courses do not reflect and adopt to the needs of real life or professional bodies. One might have many degrees of this kind but what is the point of having them if he cannot put into practice his knowledge.
Many university degrees are a result of a subjective assessment by some examiner who marks stacks of hastily scrawled scripts in a limit amount of time. Students even do not have right to appeal after their examiner's decision. That is why many capable students turn into drop-outs and drop-outs turns into millionaires.
In conclusion I would like to say that only when the university degree courses become more practically oriented and not so theoretical will university degrees have any value and adapt to the need of real life. Furthermore students will be encouraged to make some research on their own, to chose postgraduate courses and to get postgraduate degrees.

Science, technology and industrialization are the characteristic features of our world. With the introduction of machinery in the performance of our everyday tasks many changes have occurred both in our values and in our lifestyle. The main function of the achievements has been to facilitate us but it has also brought about many problems. One of them concerns out imagination.
The innovations have left us with little time and opportunity to dream. Nevertheless, people must fight for their right of indulging in illusions because they are one of the only things left which can help us survive.
The industrialization has greatly influenced our lives as human beings. Before the technological breakthrough people had a completely different way of life and of looking at it. Other things were considered critical for their survival, not machines. Most important of all was the conscious that if it had not been for their work and resourcefulness humankind would not have made the achievements and acquired the skills which we have now. Indeed, it is through hard work and the possibilities of our brain that scientists claim we have evolved. Nevertheless, this does not prevent us from doing wrong with the good.
The whole concept of man is now changed due to the development of the sciences. Although the technical revolution has provided us with means of facilitating our work and, as a whole, making our lives much easier, it has failed at one aspect which, according to me, is the most significant one - the human soul. It is of what the industrialization has deprived us. Many people nowadays do not use their inventiveness or creativity to earn their bread. Rather, they are equalled to mere assistants to machines with the only duty to help and supervise their work. If before there has been more need of workers now the reverse situation can be observed. People are becoming jobless because they are no longer needed in their working places. This mars their self- confidence and influences their whole being. Yet, there is still hope.
People find support in their dreams. They create a world of their own, with no machines present in it. It is absolutely free from evil. The relations between people are in perfect condition.
Everybody is willing the help the others and is not preoccupied with their own well-being. It is, in a way, a nostalgic look back at the time preceding the industrial revolution, when man was in harmony with nature and with him- or herself. This illusive world provides them with an escape from the brutal reality, where there is little happiness. People try to find hope and comfort in their dreams. They look upon the imagination as a source of strength with which they would continue their struggle with life.
Nevertheless, despite they escape from the industrialization which people seek in their imagination, there is still another point which connects the two. Before the technological breakthrough many people have visualized the innovations of their dreams: how they would travel fast, fly, etc. It was the industrial revolution which made it possible for their dreams to come true.
Therefore, our civilization now represents our ancestors' dreams although plus their disadvantages, which they had not taken into account.
As a whole, I would like to emphasize how desperately we need our dreams. They are the ones which will help us face the difficulties we encounter throughout our lives. The imagination will help the human mind survive in this crazy industrial world.

BGSU1006,2.5,3.0,,,,,Most University degrees are theoretical and do not prepare us for the real life. Do you agree or disagree?,"
As stated, the topic is based on the assumption that a University degree should be practically oriented. Most people may hope or even believe that after graduating from a university, they will be prepared for the real world. However, all their expectations will possibly become more realistic once they have answered the question: ""What is the aim of higher education?""
Unfortunately, in Bulgaria, the answer was and maybe still is quite different from that of other countries. This was mainly due to the political system which was in power in our country for the last four and a half decades. During that period the attitude to the educational system underwent a considerable change. The socialists made us believe in the close bound between higher education and success in life. They even managed to persuade us that the best thing one could achieve in their life was to become a student. It was such a thorough change of perspective that is still difficult to overcome.
In other countries, however, the distinction has been made between practical and theoretical education. In case a person wishes to be trained in a profession, they go to special colleges.
Otherwise, they enter a University. But when one decides to go in for a University Degree, they are well aware of the fact that what higher education will provide them with is knowledge, rather than abilities to perform a certain kind of job. Thus, they are psychologically prepared for the theoretical models to be presented to them there.
Theorizing has its peculiar characteristics and it is they that the people involved in the process benefit from. The advantages of dealing with theory account for the improvement in the quality of the student's brain.
The most important result of higher education is to provide students with situations which will help them learn to solve all kinds of problems. While studying, students are assigned many tasks to which, in most cases, they are supposed to react quickly and satisfactorily. For this purpose they need to acquire certain strategies. Not only will they learn to find the information they need and compile it in their works, but they will also learn to use their own reason. This is actually the first time in their lives when they will have to solve a ""real"" problem. No matter how insignificant and abstract it may seem to them, the methods they have acquired in dealing with these problems will inevitable be of use to them in the future.
Yet, it is not only the ways of solving problems that a student acquires. They are also supposed to remember certain amount of information. Despite the fact that now the education is mainly concerned with committing particular data to your memory, which you will need to pass your examinations, there are still some positive features accompanying the process. In any case one cannot remember information without seeing the logical connections in it. Most students are striving through the facts they are supposed to remember as trying to understand them. In this respect, one actually makes great use of their brain and, as a result, develops it. The improvement in the quality of their reasoning will certainly greatly contribute to their later life.
As a whole, a University Degree involves theorizing. Thus, it does not prepare students for the real world directly. Nevertheless, it helps improve the quality of the student's thought, which inevitably leads, although indirectly, to their success in life.

Hard, as our modern times are, they make as proud with one thing only: the technical progress we are all witnesses of. Science takes big steps forward, as well: there is a whole flood of inventions pouring out of the scientific laboratories. It seems as if the amount of inventive people increases with every single minute and while in the past such people were only few and were called geniuses and were looked up to, nowadays they are myriads and are often regarded merely as common people with a great power of imagination.
Due to such ingenious people the modern times could be regarded as times when imagination fuses to a great extent with the dry science. Let me take for an example the so called ""demos"", i.e. images presented on a computer. When I first saw such a thing I was amazed and could not believe that such beautiful thing could be a creation of a single man's mind. What my eyes beheld was a motley play of colours, forms and music. In all my ardour I spontaneously called it ""art"".
However, it was not art. As it turned out later, it was merely the result of a programme made up of several mathematical formulae with constantly changing parametres. In fact, these unbelievably beautiful demos were a product of science, not of imagination. Hence follows the question: if we can no longer tell between art and science, does it mean, then, that the human race has lost its Godlike gift of original creation that finds expression in what we call art, and has yielded to the process of total mechanization. This conclusion is too appalling to be the true one.
The problem of science versus imagination could be regarded from another point of view. To my opinion this technological progress triggers off the imagination in a certain way. To support my statement I would like to turn back to the example with the demos: the computer faced me with pictures that could not possibly be created even in my craziest dreams. They looked so cosmical that I could not believe that a simple human mind was in power to produce them.
At the same time I felt enormously enriched: I saw a new world opening before me and I could feel how my imagination unfurled. However, my fancy flew to nowhere for I realized in a flash that the computer would always be more ingenious for with it one idea would have millions of versions, while with me the idea would remain the One. I felt defeated; I succumed to the power of the machine.
On one hand there was the man who was the real creator of the programme.
On the other hand the demo was nothing but a realization of a firmly set formula that the man had simply learned and applied appropriately.
All things considered, it is the human mind that is in the very start of things. The human being is the one to flash the spark - how - by using their dreams and imagination as a basic sort of ideas.
In the last reckoning, all is in nature and waits there to be found but it is man, not the machine that is to make the invention for the machine lacks one crucial quality: intuition - the sacred inner bond of man with nature. It is mainly this inextricable, deep-rooted quality of man's which justifies the existence and application of notions such as dream and imagination.

To live means more than simply to exist. Life requires steady nerves and constant fight. The former is given by nature - one either has it or not; the latter is the result of the clash with the so called real life. There are no written rules for the leading of that life-long battle or if there are such rules, nobody knows for sure if they are valid unless put into practice.
It is claimed that one's life is only partly predictable: Unfortunately the largest part could not be foretold. Therefore, it often happens so that one has inevitably to pass through some hardships in order to understand whether they can survive or not. The more trials one encounters with, the more experienced they become. In that sense life resembles a great university.
The University proper, however, i.e. the university as an institution has quite a different role from that which is alleged to it. Everyone knows, judging from their own experience that theory and practice have very little in common. Moreover, the two often clash for what is on paper is fixed forever while what is in life is subjected to constant change.
Hence ensues all the trouble for everyone who has been a student has asked themselves if not all the time, at least once in their course of education if theory and practice are so irrevocable then what is the use of all the toil and hardships, of all those sleepless nights, sore eyes and spiritual tortures. In two words: what is the use of all this physical and moral torment that one undergoes as a student?
Unfortunately, the answer to this question is to remain in the theoretical sphere, therefore the purpose of university education is to be sought in the other field than the pure material realization of the acquired knowledge.
To my mind, the university degrees are meant to be and could not but be theoretical for the university education aims at the development of skills that have to do with one's psychic adaptation to the real world. The popular maxim that body follows the mind is to be suitably applied here for there is no such thing as objective world - everything in one's environment is the produce and reflection of one's own idea of it. In this sense the university provides a good course in positive thinking - a quality which, to me, is crucial for one's survival in the ""real world"".
In addition to that University degrees are given to ascertain one's ability to think, for the other important role of the university study is to teach students how to think: to develop their mental abilities, i.e. the ability to make logical connections, to find a way out of a difficult situation, to come to reasonable conclusions. These are qualities which are of absolute necessity in life.
Therefore, the university degrees proper are of little value when trying to find oneself some kind of a job but the acquired abilities they stand for are what really matters. For these abilities are important not only for making one's way in the real life but also for building up one's personality.

The world we live in is obsessed with the achievements of science, technology and industrialization. The modern civilization has created incommunicative, impatient, narrow-minded people that do not care for the history but only for their well-being. The fact is that we have ceased to be spiritual and simple beings and have turned into too practical, down-to-earth people.
That is why there is no longer place for imagination and dreaming in our present life.
According to me, the modern technologically dominated world has made us feel more isolated and more desperate because we have lost our vital connection with our soul and our contact with the people that surround us. Our technological age is on the way to dehumanize us and turn us into frieks obsessed with speed, perfection and materialism. TV, for example, encourages not thinking by keeping people glued to the set, offering them beautiful images and ready-made ideas. People no longer care for reading and intellectual talks because in our speed-obsessed world they do not have the time and desire to spend hours with them.
More and more people are beginning to ask the question ""Do we really need all these technological achievements to live happily?"" And more and more of them answer it negatively.
Those people educate their children to hate commercialism and to respect their relationship with the people, they encourage their children to live with animals in order to be closer to Nature, they encourage talents and positive thinking. And maybe these young people will be deprived from the sense of chaos and helplessness that is characteristic to our present life and maybe they will develop in themselves the old human values and will be really complete human beings. And maybe this generation and the next to follow will no longer feel entrapped and isolated from the essential things in life. And I merely envy these people because they will live nearer to the Nature, will gain satisfaction from everyday life, will lead a healthier life than us and will have relationships with each other based on understanding, patience, love. Let's hope that this dream comes true and that the balance between the spiritual and material aspects of human nature be restored for the well-being of us all.

Most people would probably say that in our modern world, dominated by science and technology, there is no room for dreaming and imagination. This is not so, however; dreaming is an indispensable part of our culture, of the whole Western civilization. Just imagine, for example, what would happen to Freud's ""Interpretation of Dreams"", indeed to the whole tribe of psychoanalysts, if we did not dream at all.
Almost each facet of the Western culture has something to do with dreaming and imagination.
The loud-mouthed politician, who glibly promises us that we will live better in the future if we would elect him, exists as a result of our dreams of wealth and happiness. The whole output of Hollywood film-makers plays upon the fancy of man. It is the same case with novel-writers and copywriters. The pretty doll from the TV screen, advertising a new make of pantyhose, the belligerent yahoo brandishing a Gillette razor - they all exploit our capacity for imagination and would not exist without it. Computer games, VR games, games of billiards and games of poker, games here and games there ... -it takes imagination everywhere.
The whole industrialized and commercialized reality toys with this mental ability of ours. It takes great pains to cherish and develop this particular kind of imagination, which I shall term ""fancy"".
The reason for this is obvious; unless supported by fancy, the neat system of cheating people out of their money will collapse. Besides fancy, there is another kind of imagination, which shall be called ""imagination proper"". While fancy is essentially static in nature, the mere ability to conjure up agreeable images in the mind just for the fun of it, imagination proper is the active, creative power, the tool for going beyond the surface of things. Fancy is consumer-characteristic and imagination proper artist-characteristic.
Imagination proper is more powerful and prolific. Unlike fancy, it exploits the media and the ability of man to fancy things. Without it, no ads would ever be made - or, at least, not such sophisticated and crafty ones - no novels would ever be written, no films would ever be produced, no computer games would ever be made... Imagination proper is what has made the existence of VR games and Einstein's Theory of Relativity possible. It is what gives colour to our drab, monotonous lives; adds spice to our tasteless existence.
Once a goal only for writers and painters, imagination proper has now been aspired after by all members of society. No wonder, as it is the tool which may change an exploited into an exploiter.
The pilgrimage to intellect, in addition, is being encouraged by certain modern trends in literature and other kinds of fiction. For example, the good guy in most films is no longer the muscular, first- class shot but the intellectual - usually a lawyer or a doctor - who has to face a titan of craft and evil. The fact that their struggle is rather intellectual than merely physical, is indicative of the emerging of a new set of social values - a set which gives priority to intellect and creativity.
So, in conclusion, it must be pointed out that vivid imagination, imagination proper in particular, is not only a desirable but also an invaluable quality of the mind, which helps us survive in and make good use of our complex, ""mechanical"" reality.

As recent statistics have shown, more and more people in Bulgaria choose to continue their education after secondary school. This is not at all surprising, having in mind some general trends in the European civilization. But is the university degree worth the trouble? Certainly not!
First of all it does not pay. The popular belief that university graduates stand a better chance of finding a well paid job is misleading. The percentage of intellectuals on the dole well exceeds that of non-intellectuals. Besides, those who are lucky enough to find a job are often forced to work as manual workers. Thus, for instance, the plumber may turn out to be a graduate in philosophy, and the taxi-driver, a professor in nuclear physics, working overtime to make both ends meet. Brain workers in Bulgaria are notorious for the low salaries they receive, in comparison with those of shop-assistants, booking-clerks or coal miners. So why study at university? To strengthen your mind and become an expert in your field? Not really.
Shop- assistants, for example, have more time and greater opportunity to cultivate their minds than the poor student. Once the working hours are over, they, under the influence of the spirit of the age, will indulge in reading Cervantes, Dostoevski, or Chinese philosophy, while he, poor wasted thing, burns the midnight oil, preparing stifling, petty assignments in linguistics, for instance. Instead of the promised ""development of the basic academic skills"" the student is forced to ""swallow"" up hard, tasteless facts, having nothing to do with his major. What is more, he is forced to swallow up his creativity as everything possible is done to suppress it, or, at least, nothing is done to foster it. Students are not allowed to choose courses and pursue their own interests. If a student is interested in English literature, for example, he will still have to know English phonology from A to Z.Higher education even fails to provide students with the most basic skill: reading comprehension. According to a recent survey among students, 85% of the so called ""good reader"" have developed this skill at home, having had access to good books and a lot of spare time.
The only thing higher education does succeed in doing is contribute to the general feeling of apathy and disappointment in the country. Apathy, weariness and decrepitude are the effects of the over-demanding curriculum, as students report. No wonder, having in mind the lack of vacation between terms, the many cases of cracking up under examination pressure. Bulgarian universities are brain slaughter-houses, and are deliberately so because they serve as tools for supporting the political system. Indifferent, weary people do not protest, do not fight with the current system; all they want to do is to be left alone.
So, there is a crying need for change in the educational system. Higher educational institutions, as they are now, entrap the best minds and corrupt them, turn worn-out, self-complacent fools who are unable to meet the rigorous demands of the modern world. Unless changed, the educational system will be one of the main causes for the future extinction of a nation.

My opinion is light. It is like a balloon. Once it is inflated by a refreshing breath of inspiration, it goes up in the air as high as possible. Then add some mild winds to keep it high but still close to me, which are actually, a pinch of grounding facts, and you have my opinion in full size. What an opinion! Big, fat like the o's in the very word, but still mine. Mind you, my opinion is not a hot air balloon; it is simply a balloon, one of these little kids usually play with, because it does not have a basket for carrying passengers all along: it is mine, and it is not suited for anyone else to ride on it but me.
Oh, there it goes again! Take care, and do not try to catch it and bring it down to where you stand for it may explode above your heads.
...Some people say that in our modern world... No, no, no! There must be a place for dreaming and imagination somewhere in this modern world of ours. It is just that you have to uncover it, dig it out, and tidy it up a bit for them to move in. Each one of us I think is actually doing this in their own way, in their own field, in their own time,despite the circumstances of their own life. Because dreaming and imagination are creation, and creation, according to Romain Rolland, beats death, and is survival for the humankind.
There are, although, species of our kind that are usually referred to as machine-worshippers, and therefore as deprived of the two ""survival"" keys just because of their profession. Among these are listed businessmen, engineers, computer experts, and so many others that directly deal with machines in their professional field. They are usually accused of identifying with their professional instrument or ""work-mate"", and losing the need to dream fantacize or feel, thus putting themselves down as innocent in their spiritual life.
However plausible this popular opinion may seem, it is actually completely wrong because it is only ""skin-deep"". A professor in English Literature, for instance, could be just as mechanical in his life as anyone else, and then an engineer could be ten times more creative and imaginative in his approach to life and his job, than the same professor that has given in to routine. That is to say one's professional life is no marker for the presence or lack of the ""survival' imagination and dreaming cells in your mind, because every human being is potent of dreaming and creating, though, it is a completely different matter whether they exploit this potency or just keep quite so that it goes on sleeping as a log in them. According to that choice one makes for oneself, s/he gets under the heading ""humankind"" or ""humanunkind"".
Industrialization, science and technology are simply a part of our professional life and are no factors to determine whether we choose to create or not by dreaming, since the latter are creation stimuli whereas science, technology and industrialization are creations of the mind. So they must have a place for their own creators in their systems, mustn't they?
... And anyway if an argumentative essay of the most rigid type, which an argumentative essay always is, can open with an opinion being likened to a balloon, then dreaming and imagination have not been driven away from our life yet, despite the fact that the opening paragraph of this essay is stored on a disk and would be looked at with the help of a machine - a computer.
Actually, the last just comes to show that dreaming, imagination create still in our world, and their pieces of creations exist next to technology or rather through it. Interesting, isn't it?

I am a student of Plato's. I am one of those whom he taught in the garden of Academ. It is Plato's Academia I consider myself attending, for it was the first one of its kind when it was founded - the mother of all future Universities with the abundance of subjects offered and the higher level of abstraction of the subject matter taught there. It was with it that in the IVth c. BC Plato made a, so to say, revolutionary step towards the theorization of philosophy in general, as a main subject in the curriculum, and some of the other ""sciences"" separated from philosophy, e.g. arts, sports games, mathematics, physics etc., which were also a part of the curriculum. Plato's Academia was a phenomenon that marked the shooting of ""sciences"" off down-to-earth reality and their streaming into the vast sphere of ""abstractness"" founding the base of the theoretical ""sciences"" which were an important accent in the education there. That, also, reflected on the kind of knowledge one got at the Academia; in that particular case - theoretical and academic rather than pragmatic and reality-oriented; and consequently, the kind of students that went there; again in that particular case - people with a higher mind for understanding the ways and patterns of life, showing what and how things are, rather than the facts and figures of things observed in Nature.
This Academia of Plato's I consider the first University of the kind we now know at the end of the XXth century, offering education corresponding to our modern higher education. For me, it is a model according to which a University should map itself as an institute of higher education in terms of curriculum and syllabus, i.e. the priority of the theory of things, of the general methods and patterns over the facts and quotations from ""real reality"".
In this line of thought I must point out that I do agree with, and strongly feel positive about, the fact that ""most University degrees are theoretical"". I would, actually, like to see all courses integrated in this system of organization of knowledge, that is hereby defined as ""theoretical"". My appreciative feelings concern, of course, only the nature of the higher education, and are exclusively expressed having it in mind; for University education, in my humble opinion of a student aspiring to get one, and thus being in the grip of its system, is meant to procure for the quality of mind and its mission as a learning living ""thing"", rather than the quantity of facts stuffed in one's brain as life-essential.
What I pretty much stand up to is the accepted reasoning that if a University degree is theoretical, it is not oriented towards the problems one is likely to encounter in real life, and therefore, should be of no significance at all to a real student. Naturally comes to mind the questioning of the binary opposition between theoretical knowledge and knowledge preparing for real life. It seems highly incomprehensible to me that there should be such an opposition, and I insist on these terms being defined before getting into any kind of verbal argument.
Isn't ""real life"" just life as we live it; and, isn't university education a part of that ""real life"", a realia in it? If not; whatever other kind of life is there?
I support the idea of the simple existence of one life that is real in whatever different way different people view it and approach it through labeling it. Real life is my life, your life , his life, her life, its life, our life, your life, their life, and in this respect theoretical knowledge is a part of it, and it does prepare one for it, if they have a mind for that kind of knowledge, or in other words,an insatiable need for such kind of knowledge. It is, therefore, still preparing some people for their life, or for ""real life""as is here defined, because it gives them understanding of the patterns and methods of life or simply gives them what they need for ""real life"".

We live in a highly developed society. Almost everything is possible for us and we achieve things easily. Numerous devices are designed to facilitate our lives. Science has flourished so much that with the least efforts we manage to do anything we want to. But has not all that made us automations to some extent? Doesn't science deprive us of the natural beauty in our hearts Have we lost the romance of life? Have our minds turned into machines without imagination and feelings?
Fortunately, we are humans whatever happens. Our inborn curiosity has always stimulated us to keep on exploring. Our souls have always been an unexhausted source of feelings, passions and emotions. Deep down inside we will remain dreamers who eagerly search for a brighter life.
All this sounds strange and naive. People nowadays aim at being cool, rich, prospering and powerful. Town attracts people more than nature. Happiness means cars, mobile phones, TV set, CD. Our life has turned rather monotonous. We work a lot, save money, buy and than-again the same. Values today are different from that they were.
But there is still one little particle in everyone of us that remind us of our real nature. We have not lost completely our imagination. Although our manner of life suppresses it,, it still lives in us. It would not be true if we say that we have changed so much with the development of science. We really have no time for emotions, but no one can escape one's nature. We are created with our souls, able to feel, to be happy, unhappy, to dream. We just need to awake them up and keep them awake.
Our society keeps on developing and it prospers due to us. We make the changes, we invent novelties. If we had not our dreams alive in us, it would be impossible to create anything.
Human's mind is generous and amazing. It combines strong will and tender emotions, curiosity and boredom. But the choice is ours because we are responsible beings who control their feelings and thoughts. Unfortunately, a greater part of the people prefers the monotonous living.
Nevertheless they still have the tiny flame burning inside and they only need the proper circumstances to light it again. We need the beauty in our lives and no one can convince us that we have become machine-like. We cannot escape our initial creation.....
We are humans. We have remained humans during the ages and we will be humans in the future. We must use what we have invented for our future spiritual prospering and happiness.

When people had only their hands and a fur to keep them warm they had a vast space for imagination, one could say. But in order to dream and be able to imagine you need a background, a notion, a clue. Throughout history a part of human consciousness has been piled in inconceivable amounts somewhere, hereditary and illusive, concrete and abstract.
Nowadays we can see and evaluate the innumerable triumphs of the human mind and exactly that inclines us to think that its complexity and inventiveness are infinite and therefore humans can move on only towards perfection in science, technology and art.
The virgin mind, unlimited by concepts has the whole universe to expand in, but the trouble is that it cannot realize that opportunity. On the other hand, the highly modernized, updated mind has too many concepts to be able to gain the universal. The richness of experience and knowledge, however, helps us think on a sufficiently high level; the progress in idustrialization, let us say, sets us free to dream and imagine beyond that sphere. We feel less restrained to do so boldly in a world with boundaries constantly breaking down.
Human development is a million-sided harmonious whole. The flow of influence may carry one side closer to another but it cannot drown it in the process. Science and technology greatly influence art, which is the realization of imagination, but will never be able to stifle it, nor are they only spheres of life that influence it. Therefore we cannot say that there is no longer a place for dreaming and imagination; on the contrary -- these two powers of man will always exist and create. Nothing elapses into nowhere and nothing entirely new can ever come. Everything exists somewhere - discovered or not, used or passed unnoticed, temporary or reoccurring. On the other hand would science and technology make any progress if men weren't able to dream and imagine?
So it seems as though, comparing things, imagination has existed before scientific progress and it certainly could not be dominated or limited by it.
For dreams and imagination there are no boundaries and no conditions because they are functions of human mind which can never be ruled. Man, using his historical experience, all achievements in life, all his concepts and all his insight is a powerful creature, bound to develop.
And it will never strop unless it becomes extinct.

What is the purpose of knowledge? Living in the end of the twentieth century is both difficult and easy to answer a question like that. But it is important to do so at least for ourselves.
The Earth with all its secrets, existing long before man had a chance to appear on it, has always been challenging mystery for people. Humans are created tireless investigators, eager discoverers, active thinkers. Knowledge for them is a goal, a condition, pleasure and a leader to improvement of they lives.
It seems logical enough for everybody to see the importance of the discoveries in science - they practically lead to welfare in the material sphere of life, or help to preserve life in the form considered normal. With science fields like Geography, Sociology, History, Law, Political Studies, Language Studies it is a little more difficult to define in what way they are useful in the real world.
Some of them serve society. Some of them just serve people's passion for theorizing, statistics- making, categorizing, going into the abstract. I do not know whether most university degrees are theoretical, but I can well tell about mine, which I am studying at present. It is called ""English and American Studies"" and it is maybe the ideal example of a degree which does not prepare students for the 'real world'. One side of this real world is the opportunities for a professional realization after graduation. Everyone who has heard about this educational programme has asked the question, ""So what would you do after you graduate? Become a teacher?""
Well a difficult question indeed. Having studied all British and American history, literature and culture and having received profound knowledge in the field of linguistics (including Historical Linguistics) the poor graduate finds himself at a loss in a society which either needs him for a teacher, a translator, a tourist guide, or merely as someone who knows English and could sit all day at a secretary's desk, or else for nothing at all. It somehow does not seem ""fair"". Five years' striving in the labyrinth of science and then all knowledge has to be stored in one's consciousness of a learned man.
Of course, in any country different societies exist and the opportunities vary, as well as the values. In my opinion, young people should be well aware of their aims before they apply for a certain degree. If they cannot estimate by themselves, they should be able to receive advise. On the other hand, this means that young people at the age of eighteen have to be able to think as people at the age of twenty-three, which is an awful prospect. The dilemma is clear - either grow old before their time has come or prepare themselves to be disappointed and helpless when it would be late to think with their mature minds.
What I can conclude about this problem is that what we have is not a case so much of inadequate education but rather of inadequate society, because in a modern society there has to be place for all those who deal with impractical science; for knowledge is not a means for making material progress only. If it was, what would man be like?

No one and nothing can deprive mankind of its innate and outstanding ability to dream Imagination is an inseparable part of human character and as one lives and thinks, he/she cannot help dreaming. This is why I would never say that with the development of science and technology there is less to dream about.
On the contrary, there is an intimate connection between these. The world we now live in is the dream world of previous human generations. If it had not been for imagination, things would have looked today just the same as 100, or even 1000 years ago. The reason for this is the fact that, naturally all modern inventions and machinery exists mainly because of human imagination.
First they had been born in the human mind before they fought their way into the real life. Thus, dreaming has been the driving force of human progress and as nowadays, not only does scientific and technological development continue but this happens at even faster rates than before, this points out that imagination is still at work.
Some of the opponents of this belief claim that these very developments have made dreaming unnecessary and, what is more, impossible. They ask who needs imagination when reality offers so much. In my opinion, it is not like that at all. No matter how well developed, science and technology, to say nothing of industrialization, are always a step behind imagination.
Moreover, one should not forget that often it is these innovations that lead one even far into dreamland offering a whole new world and way of experiencing it. Its very name ""virtual reality"" shows that it is just on the boundary between imagination and real life. So, generally, all the new technological and scientific developments are nothing more than an expression of human dreams with an aim to excite even further one's imagination.
What other people claim is that the introduction of modern scientific and technological achievements in society has dehumanized humankind. Undoubtedly, these changes have had profound effect on human personality and way of thinking but, in my opinion, it would not be true to say that it is because of them that we are, or will be, devoid of imagination. This is impossible because no living person can exist without his/her ability to dream. It is deeply seated in each and every one of us, just like the habit of breathing, for instance.
On the whole, despite the seeming obsession of the modern world with the material expressions of science, technology and industrialization, these have not replaced human imagination and dreaming. Fortunately, they never will because they are just a secondary complement to this unique human ability.

Nowadays education is indispensable for people in order to find their place in the real world. But is university education, in particular, of great help to one in doing this ? To my mind, most people would answer negatively to this question. Very often one feels dejected on finding out that after they have studied hard for 5 years in a university, most of the extensive knowledge that they accumulated there will hardly ever be useful to them in the real world. The reason for this is the fact that university education is much more theoretical than practical which turns out to be a decided disadvantage. One must always bear in mind that what matters more is not how much one knows but how well they can use what they know. Thus, it is pointless just to sit down and acquire knowledge solely in order to pass one's exams when one may probably never use it afterwards.
However, most universities maintain the tradition and continue teaching theory as before.
Last year, for example, we had a course in computing which was, on the whole, completely useless. Instead of being taught how to use a computer and different kinds of software, most of our time was taken up by theoretical explanations of the way in which computers work. I do not mean that this information is absolutely unnecessary but my point is that it is good for nothing when you do not know how to use a computer in order to write and print out our essay, for instance.
On the other hand, it would not be really true to say that university degrees are wholly unrewarding. Theoretical education may be less valuable than practical for one's life in the real world but, nevertheless it is very important. The reason for this is that no matter how irrelevant or impracticable it may be, it still provides one with some general idea about things in life and thus may serve as a standard for comparison. Then, as one has already formed some model to refer to, it would be easier for them to decide what to do in a certain situation. Despite the difficulty of putting theory in practice, it is far easier to do than to start directly with the latter. So, after all, it is much better to have theoretical knowledge than not to have any at all.
Both teachers and students have been aware of this particular deficiency of university education and its respective influence in one's life, so attempts have been made to correct it. One possible way of doing this has been through introduction and development of various applied sciences in recent years, like applied mathematics, applied linguistic and others. These, however, are not very wide-spread and only a small number of universities have them as separate courses.
Another way of making university degrees more useful to students is to achieve a certain balance between the two sides of education. Moreover, one should be free to choose whether to concentrate on theory or practice with respect to their future plans and personal preferences. This is very important because different jobs require different types of knowledge and what would be valuable for one student, would be of no use to another.
To sum it up, I would say that one cannot so quickly write university degrees and education off. There are still valid although they do not give one full knowledge of the real world. If they are not as good as they could be, it is up to us to change them and to make them better.
Then one will feel more confident on leaving university that they are ready to cope with problems and difficulties in life.

I believe this statement is true. We should, however, be careful what we mean by ""dreaming"" and ""imagination"". Usually people connect these two words with something close to nature and in this sense, in our modern world, there is really no place for them. I would like to make it clear that this does not mean I am against technology or science. I am not. They have definitely made many spheres of our lives much easier, but, as everything in this world, this also has its negative sides.
First, one of the main reasons why dreaming and imagination have lost their way in our modern world, is because industrialisation has created a big rush. There seem to be so many things to do nowadays, everyone is in a hurry, people constantly have work to do. Technology works fast and, respectively, we have to keep up with it. We do not feel comfortable if we just sit down and dream, we simply feel we are wasting our time. As I mentioned above, dreaming and imagination are closely connected with nature. I have often realised that when I am away on holiday somewhere in the mountains, I totally lose track of time, I have nowhere to hurry to and I find it very easy to just sit down and dwell on the scenery, or just stare at the sky without feeling that I am wasting my time. Once you are back among technology, however, the noise and the everyday hustle make you run to a tight schedule and practically nothing can stop you, except maybe a world-wide short circuit, which would not be very recommendable.
Another major hindrance of imagination is devices such as computers and television.
Children do not have to make up games anymore, whatever fun they are looking for is right there in the computer, waiting for them to turn it on. I must mention, though, that there is some kind of room for imagination when it comes to computers (not television). It opens a different kind of imagination. It makes you imagine different worlds, galaxies, spaces, things, which if we had not been in touch with technology, would have been quite impossible. Nevertheless, there is no doubt, at least to my mind, that just sitting and watching something readily made, does not inspire you to do very much by yourself, your mind is not really challenged and this wastes away your imagination. So, no matter how educational television may be, it is an absolute destructor of imagination. I should mention, nontheless, that it probably gives huge ground for dreaming, after watching all those fantastic movie stars!
The irony of the whole thing is that if it was not for someone's free imagination, we would probably not have had all these technologies today. In a sense, technology ruins its own creator: imagination.

It is quite naive to make such a drastic and generalised statement, without at least a few specifications. Alas, there is a great deal of truth in the words of Oscar Wilde who once said: ""Education is an admirable thing, but it is well to remember from time to time that nothing that is worth knowing can be taught"".
I agree that university degrees do not in any direct way help you to encounter the ups and downs of the real world. Indirectly, however, they may be able to do so by actually making you take the degree.
First, it is true that university degrees give you a lot of theory and very little practice.
Many of the universities, nevertheless, have quite a few practical courses alongside the theoretical ones. So, how does it turn out that this practice is not enough to lead you into the ever so non-theoretical world? The answer is simple. Whatever practice you get in university, it is in a given sphere of work. Universities simply do not have courses in prevailing, everyday situations.
Their spheres cover science, the humanities and arts. The whole system is such, that whatever you study has not got very much to do with how you should handle life. Thus, I believe it is evident that we cannot expect a degree to ensure, in any way, our ability to enter real life.
If looked upon from a slightly different angle, however, we could say that, in a sense, university degrees indirectly prepare us for the real world. This is done by our striving for the degree throughout the years of study, rather than the actual knowledge we get from it. In other words, it is just another one of the many experiences we gain throughout our life. In order to get the degree we have to go through approximately five years of an intensive social life. We learn to communicate with our colleagues, with the teachers, we understand that we cannot have it our way all the time, we cannot always be as blunt as we would like to be. We have to learn to be tactful, we learn different methods for acquiring things, we realise that sometimes in life, not matter how hard we have tried to achieve something, we just might not get it in the end. In this sense, the university degree is something, which in order to get, you have to enter a social institution and thus, you are forced to learn the ways of the world.
The main question that springs up after discussing such a topic is whether, as a whole, we need university degrees? They may not directly prepare us for the real world, but most disciplines, in one way or another, contribute to our knowledge of the world itself as such, for no one can deny the importance of having competent doctors and scientists, for example. So, university degrees may not play a great role in preparing us for handling difficult situations in this world, but they have other priorities and they should not be underestimated.

To say that it was an easy task to answer this question would be a lie. Not that I don't have an opinion, not that it does not concern me. On the contrary, in the breaks between the lectures or sitting in a cafe we, my colleaguaes and I often discuss the advantages and disadvantages of the Bulgarian educational system. Funnily, most often we find bad than good things about us.
But now that I can freely express how I feel about our education before the people who more or less make things as they are, I am somehow embarrassed. Maybe I lack enough information about the foreign scholar systems to use them as a basis to compare ours on.
Anyway, the two years spent in the Bulgarian most renowned University have created the impression that we study too many subjects building general knowledge of the language, literature and culture (in our as it's British culture as we are students of English philology), which in no way can be of little value. I even think it's the University can give us, although anyone who is interesed in these things can read books, watch films and listen to the foreign radio stations - the BBC, the VOA, etc. The biggest problem here are lessons in English. The exam we had to pass in order to be admitted in the University was not at all an easy one. Too be able to pass it one had to have an excellent conduct of the grammar an lexique of English, to be able to understand what one is said and to make him/herself understandable, i.e. to be able to express himself perfectly in English. About seventy of all thousand candidates were admitted and most of us expected we would continue from that point and would only improve our knowledge. Nothing of the sort. To my greatest surprise we started almost from the beginners' level and little by little it came clear there people among us who could hardly read or talk in English. They were not too many but because of them all the rest had to start from the beginning and get years back in their study of English.
The question that arises here, I think, is why should there be a mandatory exam, then, or should it be so difficult as it is (I put it somewhere between the TOEFL and the SAT) and detailed? Instead of the subjects that may not go deep in the matters they study BUT enrich the students' knowledge of the world I would ask isn't it the entry exam that is of little value?

For centuries on end men have tried to answer the many questions that exist in the Universe.
Their imagination and of course, good luck has made it possible for many inventions to be created and for many puzzles to be solved.
Lets take for instance the famous mathematician and physicist, Sir Isaak Newton who had discovered the laws of mechanics and gravitation. His work is thought to be the greatest contribution to all human-kind until Einstein created the theory of relativity in the 20-th century.
But lets not leave the 17-th century for a while. As the story goes, it was one autumn evening in 1680 when Newton was walking past his neighbours garden when he noticed the falling apple.
Just imagine what could have happened, or to be more precise, what wouldn't have happened if it wasn't for this genious' imagination. He would have jumped over the fence, picked up the apple, eaten it and then simply gone to Cambridge University where he worked since 1665 and be present at a meeting which he was supposed to attend at exactly 12 p.m. He did all that except for a tiny little moment of may be a few seconds when these great ideas came to his mind.
Can one now imagine living in the 19-the, 16-th or even 14-th centuries? think not. Everyone of us who are so used to these modern inventions that exist in our life cannot even imagine living without them. I said imagine, but I think that it is not imagination that we should be affraid of, but the lack of it. It is true that imagination may lead us everywhere but it will certainly lead us elsewhere and it will certainly broaden our views of the existing world. A typical proof of my statement is Columbus' discovery of America. He was sure that was travelling towards India, but reached an unknown land. Still if it wasn't for his curiosity and maybe even bad luck in this case it would have taken some centuries longer till someone decided to check for himself what was beyond.
Every century has its specific characteristics and even life of its own. The 20-th century is the time when science and technology are so far at their greatest rate of development. Many eras have passed till man discovered simple truths as the fact that the earth is round, for instance, and those mentioned above. It was for the imagination of many men yet to be born that human-kind shall continue to improve. It is for the minds of these people that we hope to achieve the world of our dreams.

One of the things that universities nowadays are most criticised for is that the courses offered are too theoretical and do not prepare students for the real world. Such degrees are, therefore, of very little value and significance. But is this really so?
Before discussing this question in detail and giving a concrete answer to it, I would like to point to the fact that the statement above is much too general, in order to be applied to all universities and the courses they offer, as a whole. It should be noted that universities round the world not only offer courses that lay a different amount of emphasis on the practical and the theoretical, but that the courses themselves also require a specific proportion between the two aspects. For instance, someone studying Literature or History will not need as much experience as someone doing Medicine. Naturally, the responsobility in both cases is different. Whilst a mistake made, in what you teach is not that crucial, a wrong medicine prescribed to a patient, may prove fatal. Therefore, much more practical experience is needed for courses, such as Medicine, the Natural Sciences, Law, Archaeology and so on.
Now, let us go back to the question, we set in the beginning. Drawing on my personal experience, I think that most courses cannot be very practical. The reason for this is, that universities simply do not have the facilities and the finances, needed for such a purpose. In almost any case, the institutions of higher education lack sufficient financial support from the government and cannot improve things, even if they want to. Apart from this, whenever work experience is possible, it happens so, that students are not always taken seriously by the staff at the respective organisation and as a consequence, they are not given much practical tasks to perform by themselves.
Apart from the fact that it is very difficult for practical courses to be introduced, I also think that most courses offer an almost sufficient amount of work experience and are not desperately in need of improvement. Students are usually given the chance to specialise in the area, they are most interested in and for those who do well enough, possibilities to specialise abroad are also available. 	 	What is more, I consider what is termed as ""theoretical knowledge"" very important. It is true that sometimes students have to study things that they may never need, but still these certainly have their share in the formation of the students' general outlook on life, background knowledge and personal experience. University is, to a very large extent, to do with thoretical knowledge, because it is supposed to introduce you to all areas, related to the subject you have undertaken, and without being acquainted with them, you simply will be lacking in something. In order to be a specialist in a certain area, it is essential that you know at least a little about all its aspects.
Therefore, theory can be likened to the raw material that one needs in order to prepare a good meal. Once, you have collected everything you need ( i.e. after graduation ), you can go back to your notes, select the information you need and apply it to the area, you have chosen to specialise in.
In conclusion, it should be kept in mind that theory is, by no means, useless. On the contrary, it is the the ultimate basis, out of which proficiency springs. As for the courses which lack a sufficient amount of practical tasks, they should be improved wherever this is possible.
Therefore, if the world is to continue to develop successfully, young people should be encouraged to take university degrees as much as possible.

BGSU1031,3.0,2.0,,,,,"Some people say that in our modern world, dominated by science and technology and industrialisation, there is no longer a place for dreaming and imagination. What is your opinion?","
Through the centuries, the world has undergone an immense change. Not only man's character and way of thinking have altered, but also the nature around us. With the development of science, technology and industrialisation, the world has turned into something that would be completely beyond the understanding of the people, that have inhabited the earth in the previous ages. This is why a lot of people nowadays, claim that in the current situation, dreaming is no longer possible. However, there are a number of reasons, which have convinced me that this statement is far from accurate and that it is by no means true.
First of all, we should bear in mind the fact that dreaming and the imagination are personal traits. They are specific characteristics of our personality, which means that whether someone dreams or not depends chiefly on their behaviour and then on the other, external factors. For instance, if one is romantic and imaginative by nature, they will behave as such even when in circumstances that are not very exciting. If, however, one is not this type of person, then even when placed in the most romantic situation, they will not experience any such feelings.
Therefore, we see that in the first place, one needs to have a romantic nature. When this is present along with an exciting and an interesting environment, what happens is that this person will almost surely be able to dream and imagine.
Most often, this suitable environment is presented best by nature. Beautiful places, unspoilt by human hand and breathtaking views can wonderfully stimulate our imagination. When we are in such places, we tend to relax, to forget our problems and the reality we live in, and our thoughts are free to take us elsewhere.
I must admit that such beauty spots are rare, since industry has caused an awful lot of pollution to the environment. Apart from this, the industrialisation has made people lose their appreciation and fascination with the natural and the beautiful, and to focus all their attention on the acquiring of material possessions. Thus, the strife for money has a great share in man's becoming insensitive and unimaginative.
In addition to this, science has also ended up with this result. By continually placing emphasis on the rational explanation of all natural phenomena, it subtly rules out the imagination.
And lastly, technology adds to the overall effect, by acting as a kind of support for science.
This, it achieves by the production of a great variety of goods, that we couldn't have imagined in the past.
Therefore, our modern world indeed does not provide much space for imagination.
Nevertheless, I believe that for the people who like dreaming, possibilities still exist.
A manifestation, proving this statement is the great number of books, written on almost every possible subject, the various realisations of art, such as music, painting or sculpture, the vast range of beautiful objects produced and, of course, the scientific and technological inventions.
Because of these, I would say that our imagination is still alive in us, and even though the world as a whole tends to rely on the rational, there is still place for dreaming and imagination, and this can be seen in every aspect of the existence of mankind.

BGSU1034,3.0,3.5,,,,,"Some people say that in our modern world, dominated by science and technology and industrialisation, there is no longer a place for dreaming and imagination. What is your opinion?","
Since ancient times people have developed and are constantly developing in terms of science, technology, and industrialisation. This is something that cannot be stopped. But are these the only constituents of our modern world? Is not there a place for dreams and imagination? In my opinion there still is. I think that they are not and cannot completely be wiped out although they can be put in the backs of our minds.
It is true that today people are preoccupied with making progress. Through progress they mean inventing, making new discoveries in science, earning money. This is all very good but it does not allow any relaxation. In the twentieth century we constantly have to worry how to make money, how to earn a living. This, of course, makes us rational and does not leave us much time nor place for dreaming in the everyday life.
However, imagination exists although it is suppressed. Let us take, for an instance, all the musicians that create music. This is a new kind of music created for a new generation. It is very different from any kind known. This type is made on computers and consists of samples of sounds. One can enter in it every kind of sound that he or she can think of. It is very interesting and allows imagination, both of the creator and the receiver, to unfold.
There are also some very good books written in our modern world. They show what human mind can do. There are so many interesting ideas and theories in them that they can even bring inspiration into the reader's world.
In order to make films your imagination should be very powerful, as well. A good film can bring so much light into the lives of people, sometimes even change them for better or worse.
I think that dreams are very important for us. Is not the dream that supports one throughout his or her life? If you do not dream of anything then you do not have a purpose for living. In my opinion small children dream more than people of any other age. Perhaps this is so because they are still not acquainted with the difficulties and cruelties of life. This allows them to have high hopes and expectations. But even when we grow up we still have dreams although they are much more earthly. I do not think we could live without them. They are something that gives us power, something that is a ray of light when we are desperate.
To sum up, I think that progress and imagination go hand in hand. You cannot have one without the other. How can you, for instance, invent a new product without first having it in your mindOs eye? It is impossible. In order to have a material product you mist fist have it as a product of your imagination. Dreams have a strong connection with imagination and progress. People first dream of achieving progress and then actually achieve it. All three things go together and cannot be separated. That is why I think that imagination and dreams exist and will always exist even if they are less in amount than technology, science, and industrialisation.

Education plays a very important role in our contemporary life. Education on a higher level, for instance, that a university gives, plays even a more important role. It prepares children for their future jobs, it makes professionals out of them. The development of a country depends on its young people. They are the ones who are full of enthusiasm and new ideas. However, in order to be able to accomplish them these young people must be well educated. In my opinion sufficient education can be received only in universities. To my mind, they are really very important in our society.
I think that it is not true that university degrees are of little or no value. I partially agree with the notion that they are theoretical. People have said that most of the things one learns they learn it from their personal experience and errors. However, one can always tell whether a person is educated or not. The way people behave, think, and talk almost always reveals the level of education they have. Education is not something that you can receive completely only through errors and experience. You cannot, for instance, become a teacher without having graduated a university beforehand.
When one graduates a university and starts a job there are many things that he or she does not know. They learn them gradually in the process of work. That is so because things in theory are quite different from things in practice. When one receives their education he or she learns many things that will be of no practical use to him or her in their respective jobs. There will with certainty be many things that one will not know how to do when they start a new job. I think that these things, however, are easy to pick up gradually.
There are many professions that one cannot choose to work if he or she does not have the sufficient education. Such can be, for instance, a doctor, a teacher, a dentist. How can a person make operations if he or she has not learned to make them somewhere? And where can he or she learn to make them but in a university? In the past it was very dangerous to become ill because the doctors then had not attended universities and new very little about medicine. They new how to cure with herbs but of course that did not help very often. People died even of fever that today can be cured for no more than seven days. The situation with the dentist is almost the same.	How can one become a teacher and teach others when he or she does not have sufficient knowledge themselves? If this happens our society will start going backwards. The universities are the places where the newest things are learned. If they do not exist then we will not make any progress.
In present day times those who are great scholars and people who have made invaluable for the society discoveries are university graduates. Why is this so? Because these people have access to all the recent news and data in their fields. Because their education is on a very high level. Because they are ambitious, enthusiastic, and hard working for the benefit of society. You cannot expect, for instance, that a peasant who has never reached far from the village high school will invent the newest television with a flat screen.
There is one more think that I would like to say, in addition. Universities depend very much on self-education. If the person desires to learn the subject he or she has chosen than they will become good specialists. If not, they probably will not. Therefore, the diploma one gets at the end is not so important, the important thing is the knowledge that one can demonstrate. In order a country to develop and make progress it must have good specialists. In my opinion a good specialist can become only the person who is a university graduate. Therefore, university degrees are not just theoretical and are of great value.

It is not unusually challenging to agree with this observation. The very proposed title of this essay is a living proof of the thesis itself. I am not sure whether it is exactly science, etc., that are responsible for this state of affairs, but dreams and fancies occupy less and less time and attention in modern man's life. In my opinion, most people today do not have an ounce of imagination and their dreams are a bore.
To start with science, it has received more blame than it deserves. Science, after all, is the most sublime form of dreaming and one of the two most imaginative human acts, the other one being art. Great science, like great art, is free and its preoccupation is the creation of laws and forms that have not existed before. Lesser science, like lesser art, has these laws to oblige to and can be quite unoriginal and painfully uninteresting - but this does not make people who create science people without imagination or dreams. Sir Isaac, Mendeleev, the bathing philosopher of Sirakuza - the history of science offers many examples of breakthroughs made with more imagination than mental effort, discoveries owing more to the elusive world of dreams than that of logic. However, science is too complicated for most people to be seen as what it is: an elegant, imaginative, creative game with Nature, and only the great minds who make great science perceive it as such.
For the rest, the quiet dances of the stars are astronomy, the heaving genealogical bomb- dismantling is genetics, etc, and astronomy and genetics are boring.
Technology has become the greatest modern obsession and it is quite logical that it occupies the biggest place in the mind of modern man, taking away some of the place allocated for dreams and imagination. The race for better quality of sight and sound has been given new, revolutionary dimensions by the CD and the hypermedia and now the question of WHAT is actually seen or heard recedes into the background. Videoart and computerized animation are a good thing in themselves but I think that their intervention into the seventh art becomes an uncontrollable process. The polished characters of ""Toy Story"" are far from the nice, old-fashioned dwarves and Mickey mouses of the Disney past. Last, but not least, videogames and other sorts of computerized entertainment are steadily changing childrens' play, it seems forever. And there is really no place for imagination or dreaming in sitting before a screen filled with readymade images and clicking a mouse. (Come to think of it, our children may never see a real mouse!)
The final evil listed in the title is industrialization, and where positive things can be said about science and technology, the average student's set of opinions is decidedly hostile towards this longish word. Speaking of dreams and imagination, one tends to link them to romantic ideals and romanticism has been and is inspired by Nature. Industrialization cuts people away from Nature and, in most people's view, kills what is left of their imaginative nature (with the small ""n""), with its wicked ways. We have reached and passed by the point of no return, romanticism is dead and its resurrection impossible with the current state of affairs, our traditional dreams and fancies are grayed and quickly dissolved in the powerful current of electronic consciousness which flows in upon us.
The last image portrayed leads me to a conclusive idea which looks obvious once you think about it. If, in our new technological world, our dreams and imagination are out of place, what will come in it? Will not technology inspire us to dream and create as Nature did some time ago? I believe the answer is affirmative. VR (Virtual Reality) is just a part of it. With the current state of development of science and technology, our new dreams should be waiting for us just round the corner.

Most people do seem to think so, especially those studying in Universities. However, this does not stop the flood of thousands of students every year who apply in Bulgarian Universities in order to get higher education. It seems that there is some value in it, after all, and university degrees are not altogether useless.
The opinion that they are theoretical becomes obviously theoretical in itself once we concider the degrees in different technical fields like engineering and architecture. Anyone should see that an engineer needs some sort of education added to his or her natural inclination to take electrical toys apart or otherwise we would not have cars and television sets. Most things engineers study are absolutely necessary, basic knowledge about the machines they will maintain, construct or devise in their actual professional work. The same, however, can be said with some approximation about the students of the human sciences. A translator translates better if one has some knowledge of the theory of translation. For outsiders the field of linguistics looks unintelligible and therefore impractical but it IS the linguist's ""real world"" and he is prepared for it by his or hers university degree. The real world is not just money and products which we earn and consume - it has processes underlying their existence and production and needs the specialists who are skilled to controll them.
Now imagine you are a social worker and a person comes into your office looking for a job. You should not send one who knows five languages to work as a gardener or put a person whose only knowledge is how to build ships in charge of a stock exchange market, should you? And the only existing way of finding out what a certain person is good at is looking at his or her educational record. A degree in a field determines a set of abilities which are further specified by the courses one has taken in University. Even if you can not be absolutely sure whether a person educated in journalism is the ideal choice for the vacant place of an editor in your newspaper you still know that he is most likely better for the job than a BA in applied linguistics.
Furthermore, University degrees have a very practical (including financial) value when looking for a state-paid job. Picking examples from the field of translation and foreign-language teaching: it is true that you can be a good specialist in both and find a job without a higher education; however, the salary of an English teacher without a MA degree is about twice smaller than that of a one who has graduated from an University, and it is more than twice easier for one to find a job as a translator and keep it if one has the diploma of a specialist in a language.
The system of University degrees has undoubtedly its shortcomings once scrutinized with practicality in mind. Its value, however, should not be underappreciated - at least until the opposers whose opinion is expressed in the title of this essay propose something better.

Why do we go to the university why do we sit on exams, hoping to be admitted to the university? Is it because we want to gain some knowledge, to improve our skills, or is it because we want to boast with our university degree? I know why I am a student and I have certain expectations concerning my studies.
University degrees can never be only theoretical. It is as if the rain that falls is only theoretical. What I mean is that if you go through all the courses and if you pass all the exams you can't end up with nothing improved in your knowledge or skills or ""whatever"". In fact, the major question lies in this ""whatever"". When I was at school teachers used to say that we shouldn't be cross at them when they mark us poorly, because they were only trying to learn us how to think, thus to prepare us for the life that expected us right after the graduation. I didn't believe them. But they were right. It seems that people who believed them succeeded later in their attempts to get to the university.
I thnk that the importance of the university degree starts even here. School is the first stage. The second is - University. There you continue your preparation for Life. As the ""reaching"" university is the top of the first stage, thus the university degree is the top of the second. And here comes the results of the of your work through the stages. You can see and judge by yourself if the degree you have is only theoretical or it has a real value.
But we can view things from the other side. You may never manage to finish your studiesand get a degree, end at the same time you may have acquired more than somebody with a perfect PhD. In general, the whole question for the purposefulness of the university degrees is rather contradictory. What I mean is that University teaches us how to think. It can't teach you how to become the richest person or how to live your own life. It shows you how to react in situations. I think that it doesn't matter what are you specializing in , because the way things are presented in the lectures or in the seminars, urge you to think, to use your brain, imagination and intuition. You are left on your own to deal with the problems you are facing. Improvisation and new ideas are encouraged. The whole atmosphere makes you feel part of something enormous. You are not the passive listener anymore, who are in conrol of your own work, in control of the situation.
So, the question is what do you mean by university degree, or rather how do you feel about it. I think that the degree itself has no value, but what matters is behind it. The fundaments on which you have built it. And really, University do prepare us for life.
Not directly, but with the help of other means - by lerning us how to think, or rather by learning us to think.

Dreams is the only place where people are free. Free from everything. This is the place where everything is possible, everything you want is available.
In our modern world there is still a place for dreaming and imagination. Science and technology are constantly increasing their influence and dominant role in society. They everywhere. Everyhing is connected with them. We face technology when we are born and say farewell to it when we die. But nothing can replace dreams and imagination. first, people will never stop dreaming. It is , if I can say so, inevitable that people dream. It is like to stop eating or drinking, or even breathing. Even the dullest, narrowest people dream. Dreaming in rooted deep in our mind and nothing can cut it out of there. Second, there is no one who hates dreaming. And, if you like it, how could you stop doing it? Even further, if it is restricted (figuratively said) the urge for it is even bigger. The forbidden, the hardest things are sweeter than those easily acheived. As Keats writes in one of his works: 	""Heard melodies are sweet, 	 but those unheard are sweteer"" 	 	Now , back to technology. Many things can be said about technology and science.
Some of them good. some of them not so good. But I think that we need technology and science. Imagine a world without electricity and communication devices. can you? I myself can't. What it would be like if science hasn't discover remedies for all the lethal diseases, which are nowadays thus curable? Science and technology have their good and their poor sides. For instance, technology gives grounds for more imagination. Has mankind ever dreamt more of landing on Mars more than now? This is because of the new technology.
Virtual reality gives vision to our dreams. We can see them. And here comes the other side - allienation. People get hermitted away through computers and elctronic devices. But, science and technology are things needful for the development fo civilization.
Dreaming and technology have always been , still are and will always be rivals.
There have been ups and downs for both of them. In the medieval ages dreams preavailed.
Recently , technology has been the dominant power. But a world without one of these two interconnected components is unimaginable and even impossible. Their relations are often rather contradictory. Once they are like brothers, hand in hand, and the next moment they are ""enemies"". We can think of the following: Would there be technology exusting, if it wasn't for the imagination? I think no.
So, in our modern world, there's enough place for both dreams and technology, imagination and science. One of them can never defeat the other. Even if we want this, it simply couldn't happen.

In my opinion, this topic can raise long debates. Unfortunately, I have not had any personal experience with foreign universities, so I cannot make any comparison and can only discuss Bulgarian education in this respect.
To some extent it is true that Bulgarian students study much more theory than do any practice but I cannot really say if this is good or bad. We study quite a lot of things which are not directly connected to the subject we have chosen, and would not need them later. But, on the other hand, this does much for our general knowledge, which to me is very important. I think that one must not only be a good professionalist in whatever field but must also be a person with own ideas about the world. Otherwise people would be quite narrow-minded. If one studies and works only on a particular topic or subject, one may become dangerously straight-laced and a person of limited views.
To me, to study mainly theory and do almost no practice is not good either. In this way you will end up with a big knowledge and no experience whatsoever to apply that knowledge. Practice is extremely important, especially for certain subjects. Of course, seminars at university are meant just for that purpose - to practise what we have read in theory. But I do not think they help much.
Most of them (fortunately, not all) go just like lectures do.
However, I think that there is no point in practising without having some basic learning.
Because, what would be practised if nothing is learned ?
In my opinion, a university gives you a change to study what you want but everything is up to you. You can graduate and still know not much more than before you were admitted to it. As the proverb says, ""You can take a horse to the water but you cannot make it drink"". I think this is very much true when talking about education. Whether you will become a good professionalist or not - it all depends on your will. Universities allow us to understand what we are interested in and what we dislike. From that point forward, we have to do everything by ourselves using the university's (and other) resources.
I think that universities help us but we should make our own choice, bear the responsibility of that choice, and not blame anyone, or the university, for the consequences of that.

We live in a world which is, to a great extent, run by machines. All we do is done by or with the help of some apparatuses.
It sometimes seems to me that appliances rule our lives. It is true that nowadays we just cannot do without machines. They are an absolute necessity. I think that we are not even aware of the fact how much dependent we are on technology. It is so strange to think that in less than in less than two centuries ago people lived their lives without electricity, and even without all the ordinary and little things we are so used to in present days. The alarm clocks that wake us up, the radios we listen our music on, the vehicles we use to move from one place to another, the appliances we prepare our food with, the computers which we just can't do without, medical operations - everything is run by some kind of machine, be it rudimentary or extremely sophisticated. There are times when I think that we, people, are becoming robots.
Machines are very useful. They are especially helpful to disabled and elderly people who cannot look after themselves. It is with the help of apparatuses that people are being examined and cured, even correct things in their outlook, it is with machines that other planets are being reached and explored. Everything is done much quicker and better when using some appliances.
But is everything that good ?
People can really visualize what they imagine, again with some computers . Movies are with a much better quality now. We watch fantastic fiction films. But arenOt many of them full of horror or violence created by some apparatuses ?
I think that people these days have highly technologized dreams. It is nice to have something to help you fulfill your dreams but to me there is almost no room left for what I call OrealO dreams.
Romance, for example, is left ber\hind. When a man was trying to tell me how he feels about me some time ago, his cellular telephone rang, and everything fell apart. I do not think this very romantic, do you ? Love is different now. And I do not think love really needs high technology.
As a song says, ""The simple things, they come with other price"". Those ""simple things"" to me are much more important than computers and industrialization. Those last two just suffocate and kill the former ones, or at least alter them.
Apart from that, machines do pollute our environment too much. Automobiles and different factories throw their poisonous gases in the athmosphere, in the air we breathe. And when we go to have a picnic on Vitosha Mountain, for example, we see nothing of our capital - it is covered with something disgusting and dirty.
So maybe we are paying quite a high price for having all kinds of facilities, conveniences and comforts, and it is that we are losinf or leaving very little space for the things that bring us ""real"" comfort.
Perhaps we have fulfilled the dreams of our ancestors with respect to technology and different inventions, but I think that we have lost what was in the simpler way of life. Maybe some time ago people's dreams and imagination were less complicated and more down-to-earth but they were, for sure, real. And nowadays dreams seem to me somewhat artificial, plastic.
Yes, the human mind has created great things but are all of them that good and useful ? Are nuclear bombs and other weapons good ? What is the use of all the machines that kill and hurt ?
I know that every time we gain something we have to lose another thing - that's the way things are. But I wonder is this worth the deal ? Does gaining so much machinery compensate for losing the ""simple things"" ? I am not sure that it does, at all. We have to make our choice carefully so that we do not regret it later.

Some people say that in our modern world, dominated by science, technology and industrialisation, there is no longer a place for dreaming and imagination, but I cannot agree with this statement, because, apart from providing a pleasant way to escape from the technical world, they are essential for the development of humankind. Dreams stimulate personal perfection, and imagination offers an inexhaustible source of creative ideas, so they should be highly valued even in the modern world.
No one can deny that dreaming in combination with imagination is irreplaceable as a means of relaxing. Nothing can better relieve you from the stress of our mechanical world than a visit in the fantasyland of your dreams, where there is tranquillity instead of incessant noise, spring fields of fragrant flowers in the place of concrete blocks smelling of machine oil, where kindness and love instead of apathy and alienation reign. It is so good that you can sail away to a beautiful dream-harbour, illusive and at the same time so solid (so that you can clutch it), away from the harassing duties of your tediously busy days. People especially from our modern world desperately need such a refuge, so there is not only a place, but also a great necessity for their faculty to dream.
Dreams and fantasies also make our monotonous lives colourful and interesting. We are all painfully aware of the twin-like, weary similarity between the days of the year. Our daily routine is more or less the same - you get up early in the morning, go to school or work, sit in your classroom or office till your limbs hurt, then return back home, watch television, sleep. Holidays, of course, are little pleasant exceptions to this general rule, but, on the whole, the life of the modern person is far from being exciting. Dreaming and imagination are of the few things that give it a tinge of intrigue. What can vary better your boringly long bus-rides than a fantasy about medieval castles, pretty princesses and brave knights, passionate love and happy marriages? It is maybe because of this power of dreams that when something really thrilling happens to us we feel as if we are dreaming.
On the other hand, dreams act as a powerful stimulus to personal development. If you have dreamt of something and want it very strongly indeed, then the realisation of your dream becomes your aim in life. In striving to achieve it you even unconsciously turn into a better man or woman - more assiduous and patient, more experienced and resourceful, wiser. And, as perfection will always remain unattainable, the movement forward never ends. So dreams turn out to be the driving impulse of the individual to develop, and are therefore extremely valuable even for the modern person. As for imagination, it is a major prerequisite for the scientific and technological progress because of its being the first stage of creativity.
Would Stevenson have invented the steam locomotive if the image, if not the real design, of the machine had not been created in his mind by imagination? Certainly not. Imagination is the basis of every invention and innovation, and, as there will always be need for new things, it will remain a highly necessary faculty forever.
So dreaming and imagination are of great value namely in our modern world, dominated by science, technology and industrialisation, a world, which would hardly have emerged, if it had not been for them. But, of course, people should not live only with their dreams and fantasies, because then they will become romanticists and castle-builders, for whom it is very difficult to integrate in any kind of society, the more so in a technical one.

Some people say that most university degrees are theoretical, they do not prepare students for the real world and are therefore of very little value, but in my opinion these are mainly people who do not have higher education or have long forgotten their student's years. Though I admit that there may be exceptions, I basically think that academic training is a practical, necessary and valuable thing for various reasons. At any rate, it is far better to have such than not.
First of all I would like to mention that not all university degrees are theoretical. There are ones that I consider more practical than theoretical - such are for example the university degrees in painting, drama, and the different sports. But the majority of courses are balanced - students get roughly equal quantity of theory and practice. There may be, of course, a small minority of purely ""theoretical"" courses - such as the philosophic and theological ones - but you can hardly get any extensive practice in these areas.Even if we accept the statement that most university degrees are theoretical, that will not be a very significant drawback, because there is always a link between theory and practice. Practice is impossible without theory to the same extent as theory is useless without practice. In order to move on to the actual performance of something, first you have to know how exactly to do it. You must have the foundations of theory, on which to build your house of practice. For example, if a man is a surgeon and has to remove the left kidney of an ill patient, before starting the real operation he must know where that organ is (in order to make a cut in the right place), how exactly to take it out from the patient's body (so as not to disturb the functions of the adjacent organs), and how to sew back the disconnected tissues (in order to prevent bleeding and infections) - knowledge that he must have obtained from his training at the university.
It is, on the other hand, said that university degrees do not prepare students for the real world. I basically agree with this, because I am convinced that it takes a very long period (sometimes a whole life) to get prepared for the real world. Four or five years - the interval of time during which people study in universities - are far from enough for this grand aim. Nevertheless, I do believe that the long and paved with hardships road to the obtaining of an university degree provides students with some of the necessary characteristics to successfully plow their way through the jungle of life. The academic atmosphere stimulates students to better themselves and develop their minds. So they leave the university fairly well equipped for any problem that may present itself in their future life. Moreover, if academic studies do not furnish them with all the knowledge and abilities needed for life as a whole, they certainly give students satisfactory training for their future professions.
Higher education is necessary and dearly valued, because every country needs people with university degrees to govern it, to make its laws, and develop the various sciences and technologies in its territory. In fact every sphere of life is in need of people with academic training, and nearly every person must have such. This is just another reason why it is ridiculous to claim that university degrees are of no value. Furthermore, in our modern world it is always better to have studied in an university than not. For the old, rustic way of life people did not need much knowledge of anything apart from land, plants, and domestic animals, but now the situation has changed dramatically. Nowadays we have to be informed about many complex things, and training in an university is the basic way to achieve this. What is more, an university degree secures better job prospects.
So it is highly advisable for everybody to get an university degree, because it would not only prepare them for their future professions, but it would also give them clues as to how to cope with real life.

People are so dependent on technological products these days that they no longer pay attention to them. Phones, faxes, computers are an integral part of our every day life and we do not ask ourselves how and why they have become so important. We simply need them.
Unfortunately, sooner or later we realise that although we communicate with each other through them, we get more and more estranged. We have almost become slaves to the technical appliances, tools and gadgets and this somehow restricts our freedom of communication.
Ordering pizza with the help of your personal computer than go buying it yourself, or surfing Internet to read magazines and even Encyclopaedia Britanica is nothing else but becaming a prisoner of you own. Of course, this is an entirely personal decision.
In my opinion there is place for dreaming and imagination just that they have changed a lot. We no longer read books on a candlelight, but it is something normal, we have got electricity and light bulbs. We even have 'computer' books. We no longer use the warmth of the fireplace, because we have got central heating and the mantelpiece is the home of family photographs and dust. We wake up in the morning by the beeping of an alarm clock instead of the cock-a-doodle- doo of the cock. Now we dream how to invent a new kind of light bulb that will not need changing every other month; or even dream about how to make space our second home.
I do not want to deny the technological progress, we have to move ahead, but we must leave some time for dreaming and romance. We must escape from the metropolis for a couple of days, travel to the country and see the world with different eyes. We shall not die if we switch the lights for just one evening, light a candle and try to find some time for the humane inside us.
The development of the technology is very important, our helth and lives depend on it.
We need food, clothes, many other things which are produced, because of the technological progress. Medicine need research and materials to help and find a cure for AIDS and cancer - the diseases threatening the human race. In the end things are so interwined that it is hard to tell which is the more important thing - our dreams or our progress. Of course, there is a lot of space for imagination, because there are so many uninvented things and besides we have still a long way to go.
Our life is easier with all these technological appliancea so we must find some more time for dreaming, because dreams are vital and they help us to stay alive in spite of all the problems.

There are millions of people all over the world studying at universities or colleges and I do not think they are doing it just for the fun of spending a nice time with friends. The decision to continue one's education at university is very responsible and has to be totally individual, because it is maybe one of the most important steps people take.
Some people, specially nowadays, often ask the stupid question, ""What do you need this education for? What will you do with your degree?"" I usually answer them, "" Because I like being a student and because I need the knowledge, not the degree"". Of course there are people who literally waste four years in order to get to get the degree, thinking that it will offer them a well-paid job and a luxurious life. Having a degree does not make you smarter or ready for the real world, but it gives you the strength to feel that you are able to cope with the challenges when they appear. During the years of your study you gather experience, you meet interesting people and learn useful things about life. How prepared you will be for the real world depends not on the degree, but on your instincts and personal qualities. They are the important things, knowledge can only help, because it is available to everyone not matter if they are studying at university or not.
One of the greatest feelings I have ever experienced is expanding my knowledge and seeing the results of that. It is wonderful to open a book written and published 100 years ago, to be able to ""touch"" the work of an author you do not know but you feel like you do, only because you read his book. The knowledge of the world has been gathered for centuries and is an immense privilege to know you can have it entirely for you if you wish to accept it. So, this is very stupid to throw it all away, because it is ""theoretical"". Moreover, everything in our world is based on theory, then comes practise and experience.
I support the view that the university degree is theoretical, but that does not make it less valuable. The degree is just a certificate that you have finished your education, but the value is how much you really know, so generalizations of such kind are irrelevant.
Sooner or later people dive in the ocean of the real world and most of them find that it is hard to keep your head above the water. If you have learned how to swim, even on theory, there is a big chance that you will not drawn. How you are going to swim, if you are going to swim at all, depends entirely on you.

Some people say that in our modern world dominated by science, technology and industrialization, there is no longer a place for dreaming and imagination. Some people say that dreaming is a waste of time and imagination - a ground for science fiction. Some people say 'Forget about the dream. It only causes pain. Who needs pain, ah? Choose a mask and be happy with it. '.
I say ' Hold on to the dream! '.
I say ' Take care of the dream! ', For what else is it but your own soul and what shall you do without a soul? Die? Do you want to die prematurely? OK, then go on, put a mask, hide yourself, kill your soul, and turn into a robot, a piece of metal smaller than the worm. Let science, technology and industrialization rule your life. Being nothing more than a poison a factory vomits, you will never see the treasure it produces.
Once you lose your soul you lose your treasure forever. Leaving your dreams and your imagination is like leaving yourself. It is an escape, an escape from your real self. It may be either a conscious or unconscious choice - forgetting your dreams and turning your life into figures and computations. I cannot judge such people who make such a decision since they have their own motivations. Many people suffer from dreams that have not received their realization. It really hurts deeply when after hoping and aspiring fervently, everything turns out to be mere illusion and Destiny most impudently laughs at your miseries. There are several ways in which people react to such a situation. Some laugh back at Destiny, take irony as their further mode of behaviour and do not bother any more. Everything looks calm and easy but only superficially.
Deep down in the subconscious there is a struggle going on. The dreams and the imagination want to go free of the fetters such people have put on them. Others withdraw within themselves and fall into chronicle depression. They feel so hurt that they do not try to find the answers to the previous questions any more and disappointment becomes their main condition in life.
In both cases people create barriers within themselves leaving their problems unsolved. Many of them turn to science, technology and industrialization as spheres in which they can deal with something material, concrete and practical. No more abstract dreaming. It is already a childish thing to do. No more feelings involved but only reason. Nowadays the best friend of man is no more the dog but the computer. In that hostile world that has killed your pure dreams, the computer can easily become your preferred company. It is silent, executive, loyal, insensible, interesting, so it can nearly fill all the emptiness inside you and relieve the vegetable living. It turns out that the computer substitutes not only handwork but also psychological necessities. Anyway, the latter is only on the face of it. Closer psychological examination would show that the previous problems are still here. Perhaps they are buried deeper somewhere in the depths of the subconscious.
There is another reason why science, technology and industrialization dominate in the modern world. Since most people feel a considerable lack of order in their personal lives, they try to compensate for it in the outer world. This is what industry and technology represent - order, systems, organizations and rules. We should be in keeping with the order and rhythm of the Universe and science and technology are our tools in the process. There is nothing wrong with this. But why should dreaming and imagination be completely ignored? Why should they be considered as something decadent and left in the romantic poems of Shelley?
Why should not be there a place for them? They do have their place in the world and will always have it, as well as each of us - humans has his or her own place. Because dreaming and imagination come naturally from our souls, they are more important than science, industry and technology. Our spirit is beyond everything. Without it we are just little nothings.
Dreaming and imagination are our divine sources of eternal power and delight.
The dreams are our magic world collecting all the things we love, long and aim for, all sacred passions and desires .As long as there are dreams, there will be searching and striving for the Better.
Since ancient times imagination has been the source of inspiration for poets, artists, actors, scientists, musicians. Imagination is dimensionless. It is our immortal inner voice. It includes dreaming.
Psychology explains that during dreaming our mind is open and active at the highest degree and the restrained or sleeping zones are minimal. This is because in dreaming the messages sent to the nervous system are numerous so they stimulate multiple nerves and activate the larger part of the brain.
There is, however, a higher form of dreaming - meditation without which neither science nor technology would exist.

BGSU1052,3.0,,,,,,Most University degrees are theoretical and do not prepare us for the real life. Do you agree or disagree?,"
'Every medal has two sides' says an old English proverb. Similarly this subject has its two opposing directions. On the one hand it can be accepted that university degrees are theoretical and do not prepare students for the real world thus being of very little importance. On the other hand their value cannot be fully ignored and they do have their significant part in people's lives.
University degrees can be thought as theoretical because they are the result of a theoretical education. In the real life actions, communication, struggling and competing are needed, not passive writing of reports, essays, doctorates and leisure reading. Our Bulgarian education is chiefly theoretical because it provides us with extensive knowledge and rich culture but with no skills in using it in practice. Even all the elaborated reports you once wrote cannot help you in a critical situation in your job when you have to decide instantly, on the spot. Then instead of picking the most important characteristic of the problem, you will be lost in chaos of useless details you were made to remember during your student years. It turns out that you have been wasting your time through the years inspecting carefully the membrane of your subject and missing the nucleus. In such a case your university degree-M.A.or Bachelor-means nothing.
Nowadays, however, an increasing application of American models of education is taking place. This fact shows that things are changing in favour of the pragmatic thought. It teaches that when you study something you should know why you are doing it and how you can use it for the betterment of the world. Such an approach creates a media of competition, communication and discussion thus simulating reality.
If we exclude the concrete qualities the university sometimes fails to give you, there are some common, abstract ones you acquire. For instance the university teaches us to be hard working, organized, conscious, executive, creative, diligent, perseverant and ambitious. In this sense the university does prepare us for real life and the higher the degree the amount of these qualities.
In my opinion our Bulgarian education is not standing still but is constantly changing and improving now, contributing to the full realization of its youth.

BGSU1053,3.0,3.0,1.0,2.0,2.5,3.0,"In his novel ""Animal Farm"" George Orwell wrote ""All men are equal but some are more equal than others"". How true is this today?","
The question about the equality of people has been largely discussed over the centuries and today, and it has always troubled the people.
The most easily distinguished inequality is that between poor and rich, between two or more different classes, between king and its subjects.
Still, it's very difficult to talk about equality and inequality, because these terms are rather relative,. Every single person defines them in a different way, the way he thinks is right. And the way one thinks and expresses himself shows a lot of things - the way he has been brought up, for example, or the kind of school and university he has graduated from, even one's nationality and religion. And this is one simple evidence that people and not equal. There is not even equality between a mother and a child. And there shouldn't be. All people are different, with different characters, believes and so on. Everybody has one's own rights and responsibilities.
For example. One who cleans toilets can mot be equal to a professor of medicine. I mean his status in the society, his earnings and his education are not equal to these of the professor. But we cannot say that the one who cleans the toilets isn't as necessary to the society, as the professor. We need such people. We need people with all kinds of possible professions. But these people cannot be equal, because everyone has different education, intelligence and so on.
But they surely must have equal rights as it is said in the ""Bill of Rights"", because everybody contributes to one's country or society in one way or another - in his fun way, actually.
So, it is important to distinguish between equal people with man with equal rights. They are also different questions.
Looking back in the centuries we will always be able to find people belonging to one society, with different rights. In the Ancient Rome, for example, the society was divided into three major classes. The first class were those people who took part in the ruling of the country, so they had all possible rights. The second one hadn't got so many rights, but still, enough. While the third class had no rights at all.
In the Middle Ages there were always people, mostly the lower classes who didn't have any rights. And that was considered normal. In America (last century) the black people were treated as unequal to the white, not only by the ordinary citizens, but by the government itself. And for those days it was something normal. Whether it was normal or not, it is a matter of another topic or a matter of times.
So, today all people are equal, more exactly, have equal rights, at least by law. I also can say that today ""some are more equal than others"", or some have more rights than others. This mean that today people who have some kind of power as gunmen or whatever, can take extra rights for themselves. Unfortunately, as many people say today: ""money rules the world"". That can be applied to earlier times either, but for today it is much more true, because everybody, even little children think about money, as the most important thing in this life. It is unfair, it is not good, but it is ""the way of the world"".

I dream. I dream of a rest, of a drink, of small things and big things. And sometimes it seems to me, will never came true. But it makes no difference to me is that I dream. In such a cruel world I still dream. In a world dominated by science technology and industrialization - I dream and imagine. I'm not saying that I'm trying to think about creating new technologies or ways of visiting the Moon, I just imagine them already existing, or - me already on the Moon. I see my family there, the relationships between people there, which have nothing to do with those on the Earth.
My ability to dream and imagine crazy things, amuses me a lot and keeps me alive. I mean it can keep me occupied for a long periods of time, without making me bored, or irritated. I think imagining and dreaming are ways of being with yourself - alone. They are ways, which allow you to be what you want to be, no matter what you are, what industrialization and science technology have made of you.
We couldn't be humans is we call people, I mean, were unable to dream or imagine, or even if we found no longer a place for dreaming and imagination. Dreams are human's wishes, aims of life, which, of course, may or may not happen, but without them life would be boring, even senseless and pointless.
This is a characteristic of the humans to strive for a better life, for improvements whatsoever, to yearn for something, what would have happened if people hadn't wish to industrialize and modernize? I mean - how would they have lived and what for? Just eating, sleeping and going to work is not enough. If we hadn't got aims - that is dreams - to achieve, why should we do those things? We could simply die. My opinion is that people are created in this world to dream and imagine, so that they could create modern technologies, because creating, making something, can be achieved only through dreaming and imagination. So, if there is really on place nowadays for these typical human characteristics, the world will soon come to an end. But I'm sure there is and there will always be a place for dreaming and imagination because otherwise we would be no longer humans.
Dreaming and imagination form the spiritual part of the people, of the human beings, they follow the desires of the hearth, while science technology and industrialization are products of the brain, i.e. the ability of people to think (unlike all another creature). Yes, if it hadn't been for the heart's desire, or that is, if people hadn't dreamt of them to happen, they wouldn't have been any new technologies. So, new technologies and industrialization cannot exist without dreaming and imagination and vice versa.

The world we are living in is without any doubt a modern and civilized one. It is not like the world five hundred years ago, it is not even like the one fifty years ago. Perhaps we - the people who live nowadays, are happier than our ancestors, but perhaps we are not.
The strange thing is that we judge and analyse their world without knowing it and maybe without trying to know it. The only thing that is certain is that the world is changing and it is changing so fast that even we cannot notice it. Sciece has developed to such an extent that it is difficult to believe this can be true. A simple but quite impressive example of this development is the genetic engineering. Scientists have achieved something which was considered impossible and even monstrous before. Probably just in a few years they will be able to create a rational human being. Technology and industrialisation have also developed and in the present moment they do not stop developing. The consumers are overwhelmed by all kinds of products and goods. Technology is everywhere - in the houses, in the streets, in the shopping centers. We cannot run away from it even if we want to.
On the other hand we do need all these new technical products. We can no longer imagine our lives without a TV set or without a telephone. Computer systems like Internet enable us to communicate easy and fast. We are modern people and as modern people we are surrounded by all these things, by all these products of science technology and industry. This is our world. Whether we like it or not we must live in it. But all these inventions and innovations cannot change us - we remain human beings. With or without a washing machine we do not turn into animals. People are capable of adjusting to their environment and to remain humans.
In my opinion, technology cannot change us so much and to make us forget what is to dream and imagine. There is always place for dreaming and imagination in our modern world. If there was not imagination our lives would have been so dull and colourless and everybody would have gone crazy. I do not think that we can live without dreaming. Because if we do not dream we would not have any aims to achieve, we would not see a light in the end of the tunnel of life. It is our imagination that helps us go through the difficult moments in life. For example when your boyfriend leaves you it is such a relief to imagine that you will smash his face the next time you see him.
This is just a small relief but sometimes it helps you to feel better. But imagination helps not only in such cases it helps us to create our own world in our minds. A world where we could go whenever we feel the need to escape from the real one. A world where everything is the way we want it to be, where people are good and love is real. It is a fairy tale where we can go and relax, it is the improved mirror image of reality.
Imagination and dreaming will always have place in our modern or not so modern world.
Without them neither art nor literature will exist. And the fact that they still exist is a proof of the existence of imagination. If it was not for it I would not be able to write this essay, would I?

Education is and has always been considered one of the most important factors in our lives as human beings. Although the education we get nowadays is quite different from the one centuries ago and even a few years ago it is not of less importance. Ever since the creation of the world people have been hungry for knowledge.
They wanted to know about the earth, about the animals, and above all about themselves. Things have not changed a lot since that time. Nowadays, people know that the earth is round and that we are not alone in the universe, but still there are things which remain a mystery. There are always new territories of knowledge to conquer. Although, our world has developed a lot and we know much more than our ancestors did, we are still eager to learn. This quest for knowledge reflects on the educational system. The educational system has become very flexible and modern. Yet, there are a lot of shortcomings.
The problem is that this system is not the same in every country. Infact this is not a problem because every educational system responds to the needs of a given society. There are without any doubt hudreds of educational systems and if we are to make a survey it will take a lot of time and efforts. So in this essay I will concentrate on the educational system in Bulgaria and I will try to make some comparisons with other educational systems. In our country the universities offer a wide range of choices of education. According to one's interests one can choose a suitable area of learning. But the main shortcoming is that most university degrees are theoretical and do not prepare students for the real world. Maybe this is a shortcoming of other university systems not only the Bulgarian ones, but as we live and study here it affects us a lot.
We study four or five years and when the time comes and we are to look for a job, the things become very difficult. It turns out that we must learn a lot in order to become good specialists.
Thus we lose another one or two years to learn things which we are supposed to know already.
And when the people of our age in other countries have already their own companies we are still learning how to make an account or something of the kind.
I will give a simple example of this difference. Sofia University and The American University in Blagoevgrad are both in Bulgaria but the difference between them is a big one. In the American University, students have the opportunity to work and earn their own money, they have computer rooms where they can work on their assignments also there is a huge library with all kinds of books. In Sofia if one wants to work and earn money the University do not offer such an opportunity. There are no computer rooms and if you are to write something on a computer you must find one somewhere else, if you can. In the library there are one or two copies of the books and if you are lucky you can find something to read.
As everything in our country is changing maybe the educational system will also change and give better opportunities to the students. But for the present moment the education we get do not prepare us for the real world, so we must do it ourselves. This is not a happy fact but it surely is a true one.

So far, the twentieth century has been an era of new inventions and an arena where imagination and science combine or, at times, collide - just like the spirit and the matter. However victorious science may have proved, imagination should not be carelessly discarded.
First, it is the fact that there have always been artists and, respectively, works of art, that gives us good grounds to assume creativeness has been at work. Moreover, it has been co- existing with technology. And second, imagination will exist as long as people cherish it and look for its application in our modern world. In this world there will also be a place for dreams.
For centuries now artists have relied on some initial inspiration to drive them imaginative over a particular subject. The images they store in their minds need to be somehow visualised so that the 'subject' is conveyed to the artistic public. Most of the times this is achieved through some device. Nowadays, it is especially some electronic device or technics involved in the process of creation: poets make a wide use of computers and so do writers besides keeping a comprehensive record of our computerised society; actors and directors cannot go without electronic guidance if they are to survive competition; 'special effects' are the ratings hit when it comes to overall movie impact on the viewers. Painters and graphics tend to sell better if they have resorted in any way to Apple Mac assistance, though still concealing it; composers keep in step with recent appliances to produce a more precise sound and voice-failure-proof music. To 'produce' !?, one might object. Definitely, to create, that is to bring into being some imaginary sounds. This is only possible through the medium of mechanical devices and electronic gadgets, in particular. That is already technology. Multimedia, synthesisers, CD bookshelves and three- dimensional cartoons - they all account for the end of this millennium and for the 'capacity' of the ingenious human mind. Think of all these modern inventions which had been once (not long ago) just projects taking shape in the minds of their inventors. Only lately did they actually take shapes, namely, became materialised. The things mentioned above can now be seen, touched and utilised, needless to say, easily. On the one hand, they are some sorts of tools meant to be the go-betweens of our ideas and their realisation; but on the other hand, they were also 'created': first devised and eventually designed. At both stages some inventive spirit was applied preceding the manufacture. Imagination is that spirit and the creation itself is the matter which stands behind twentieth-century industrialisation.
However, such innovations are intended not only to facilitate our lives, to assist artists in the production of a better artistic effect and thus to facilitate their lives, but also to entertain us - the people who consume art. The public, then, would care for up-to-date techno products as long as they need to be amused.
We can sum up, then, that imagination enables us to produce new technologies and, meantime, to use these technologies to trigger our own imagination much further. And modern equipment is quite accessible, fairly cheap if not free. The Internet for info-seekers, the English Corpora for foreign learners, Shakespeare Interactive for bookworms... - all these could be found on one and the same personal computer which could be hired, taken second-hand or paid in instalments but, by all means, be available. Action, sound and vision may accompany us everywhere just like in a commuter train with only one remark - that it is not the outside view implied here but one's mobile televideophone, speaking watch, or portable computer on his knees. Parents ask, 'Don't virtual reality and video games render our kids communicatively impotent?' Certainly do, in terms of improvisation, because kids tend to lean on programmed electronics. But this is not what imagination is about. Today kids get handfuls of information just on a daily basis instead of spoonfuls of lime juice; they get knowledge and can be hardly fooled.
In our practical world do we raise technocrats, then? We rather raise wonderkids who are capable of both pragmatic and inventive thought. They do not lack imagination if they cannot 'imagine' that Santa Claus exists. A naive belief rarely appeals to them but cyber intellect does, because they know it is the key to the future. Therefore, imagination also goes beyond reality, whatever modern reality is, be it industrialised, computerised or commercialised.
To fancy something that is not virtually present except in one's mind - and one's mind is boundless - means there will always be room for fancy. Moreover, our fancies are likewise our dreams and fantasies in the sense that they are our aspirations for a 'slightly' different reality and are our cherished hopes which spring eternal.
On the whole, the reality we live in is dominated by science and technology which do not seem to harness one's imaginative powers but to enhance them, supplying one with the necessary equipment to carry out his ideas. The ultimate product of our imagination and our knowledge, which could be labelled ""science"", is creativity.

It is a truth universally acknowledged that our age is the age of machines. Technology, industrialization and communications have developed and are still developing at a very fast rate. It is actually so fast that you find it difficult to keep pace with it. Thus if you buy a computer, for instance, that you are assured is the newest product of the industry at the present moment, you will certainly be surprised to find out in a year's time that what you paid dearly for a year ago constitutes nothing more than a useless heap of junk. In this way the new technologies and innovations which are meant to help man and make things more comfortable, actually reach the point of being rather an unpleasant nuisance. Thus, at a certain point of time you will probably find it much more easy to steer a spaceship than to operate a TV set. It may sound absurd today but in my view could well be the case in near future.
There are things in life, though , that don't change as quickly as that and that even are considered by some ever lasating. Such are the works of art that people have been producing eversince the dawn of human civilization. These works are products of people's imagination and dreaming rather than of rational thinking.
Basically imagination and dreaming are associated with concepts like creativity, freedom of mind and soul whereas practical thinking stands for reason. In my view imagination and dreaming require a simplicity of heart and soul that is to say, mind released from the burden of the artificial, mechanical thinking, which is inevitably imposed by the rich in technologies and computers everyday life. To my mind it's the children that enjoy this freedom of mind and soul today. They are the ones who feel at ease in the world of dreams. Children can see and observe what grown-ups are unable to because only they possess the purity and sharpness of the senses that vanishes once you grow up. How can a mind burdened with reason, scientific explanations and mathematical logic allow itself to dream or imagine. This is in my view impossible because these concepts are too opposite to co-exist.
The computers and technologies that keep on pervading our lives, providing us with ready products, which being useful on the one hand devoid people of the opportunity to think and develop their inventiveness. People become rather one-sided, develop pragmatic thinking and are easily involved in what some call ""The rat race"" .It is, however dangerous to go on trying to keep pace with the constantly developing science and technology because it might turn out at a certain point of time that man has fallen prey to his own creations.

There are quite a few people who think that higher education is unnecessary and that there is no point in studying at university. With the technical schools and the gymnasiums being rather popular nowadays most students would consider it enough to complete high school and don't take the trouble to continue studying at a higher level. This phenomenon alone is quite eloquent and understandable too. And one doesn't have to search very hard to reach the conclusion that there are plenty of factors contributing to that unfavorable attitude that people in Bulgaria have towards university education.
Just take a stroll downtown to the marketplace and you'll find why so many people consider university studying useless. There is hardly any person in the world who can convince me that one needs to graduate Nuclear Physics to sell cucumbers or to have a PHD in literature to deliver newspapers. However, if one goes to an average Bulgarian marketplace one is most likely to encounter qualified people doing low-paid unqualified work. I haven't seen any recent statistics but I'm sure that the number of people who work in the field they have specialized in is very low. What is the point then to study when you know you'll end up cleaning lavatories or washing dishes? Naturally these are jobs like any other but you don't normally study all that much to be able to perform them. And knowing that once you graduate you join the long gray queue of young unemployed people is hardly any stimulus for a young person to apply for university.
Unfortunately unemployment is a major threat not only to those who study theoretical matters but to graduates of the technical institutes too. People studying practical things such as engineering unable to find decent jobs is, I'm sure most people would agree, not the rightest of prospects. And thus most of these graduates become frustrated due to the lack of proper occupation and consequently much energy, talent and knowledge is wasted. Then one starts to wonder whether there's any point in studying at all. In the last few years, though, things have changed a bit. As the country shows some signs of improvement in terms of economics and political stability people start to see a light at the end of the tunnel.

Although I disagree with the statement given above, I think it is quite beautifully formulated. In my opinion, there are two things that make the world a fine place to live in and worth fighting for - they are dreaming and imagination. Anyone who makes anything is driven by these two ""instincts"". From the infant attempting its first scribble to the multinational manufacturer - instincts as fundamental as taking your next breath. You need dreaming and imagination as to take the next step and make whatever you are making better. As you seek to understand you create, you enhance, you progress. And by doing so, you make the world a better place - you fulfil a dream.
No matter whether we are infants making better drawings, scientists making better medicines, governments making better laws, manufacturers making better products, we all are making someone, somewhere, somehow happier - and that is due to dreaming and imagination. What I am aiming at is to prove that science, technology and industrialisation regarded as a part of the human progress are nothing but mere results of dreaming and imagination. These both are indangered not by science, technology and industrialisation. The real danger lies deep down in our souls and it is called ""The Rules of Society"". What are they (one may ask)?! The list begins with law and court order, then comes etiquette with its ""frigid air"" of formality and , of course, I shouldn't miss the conventional concepts that hinder the development of science and art. If you allow me a little deviation here, I would like to elaborate on the ""conventional concepts"" because I find them important and quite relevant with our topic of discussion. I believe everyone has encountered the common stereotypes of ""happiness"" and ""unhappiness"", ""love"" and ""hatred"", ""success"" and ""failure"", ""black"" and ""white"". Would you agree that we have nearly mathematical definitions for the most important things in our lives and I do not see much space for dreaming and imagination here...
What is worse they are not only rejected - they are forbiden too. Once, when I was in the first class we had to draw a rabbit. My rabbit had red ears and a pair of wings. Strange? Well, at least my teacher thought so. She got angry, made me stand in front of the class and show them my drawing - they all laughed!... Nobody seemed to understand that my rabbit was scared (which was the explanation of its red ears) and it needed the wings to fly away from the danger...
For me this story is an illustration of the fact that breaking the conventional truths has its risks, such as the loss of carefully created image, or the loss of friends, or the loss of peace and quietness in one's life. If you choose to be a law-abiding average man with average dreams and needs, then the ""rules of society"" will keep you out of harms, providing a blissful and quiet existance for you. But if you love adventures, if you like rabbits with red ears and wings then you become either a criminal or politician. The former lives in a world with no rules and the latter sets up the rules in society, but what unites them is imagination.
In the beginning I said that dreaming and imagination are vital for us and I mean it. Without them our capacity for happiness you could fit into a match-box, without taking out the matches first.
Probably you agree. The thing is that by the conventions we are prescribed a Recommended Daily Requirement of dreaming and imagination. We almost take them in the form of pills and I am afraid we have forgotten how they really taste. Science, technology and industrialisation, however, have nothing to do with it. The progress we made, are making and will make in these areas is due to those who give wings to their imagination and are not afraid of dreams.
According to me, what lies beneath the statement that in the world of science, technology and industrialisation there is no longer place for dreaming and imagination, is plain fear. The fear to admit that we are losing them and there is no one else to blame for.

Modern world - the true blueprint of human desire and its inevitable downfall. A place equal to dreamland for some and pure living hell for others. Superman and supernature clashing in a tough competition for survival. Like it or not, that seems to be nearly what we have achieved, while striving for progress (or is it merely progression through unlearning), during the years of our existence. So full of what is right that we have been actually blind for what is wrong.
Yes, it is true that scientific progress and global industrialization practically dominate the world we are living in. But have these already conquered even what is not subject to profits?! As the old saying goes: there are always two sides to every story. There are those who will never submit to the monotonous rhythm of everyday life and are in a constant quest for any possible escape from ""the gray race""... And then in the other corner the ones, smashed by pressure or restraining their desires, who live their shallow lives just the way they are and even seem to be more or less satisfied with it.
Technology has gradually become a major factor in our daily lives and nowadays almost all spheres of society are dependent on its level of progression. To the artificial arts we can add the remarkable achievements of scientists, who lately seem to be able to invent whatever one can think of. And not forgetting all the industrial corporations, producing as much waste as profit (while hiding behind a shiny mask of caring people)... Here it is: twenty first century planet Earth!
Can we recognise it?! Well, that is a quite hard question.
Very often we come to ask ourselves if it is possible to go on living like this. We start to question if there is a way to get out, break free from this non-stop twenty four hour vicious circle. Of course it is very convenient to fly away on the wings of our imagination; or if it is too weak for that purpose why not just submit once more to the electronic power (we otherwise hate so much) and spend a couple of hours, even days in a virtual world. One which scientists have made merely perfect; so colorful and true - an almost real oasis for our tortured minds. But will this awesome trip to the world of fantasy help us overcome the burdens and keep on struggling when we are back?
Definitely not!
In such a burning reality, that we are living in, it is of no use trying to escape from what we are chained to. Though modern world has turned into a some kind of prison for its own inhabitants, our only choice is to get used to it and strive for a positive change instead of fooling ourselves around with some three-dimensional lies.
There is always a place for a little dream, but that is exactly where it all ends, because refusing to accept reality is a weakness and weakness in real life is fatal!

An estimated fact is that nowadays the number of young people, who chose not to continue their education after graduating high-school, is getting bigger and bigger. Most of them consider further involvement in any science to be of no practical value and do not even bother to check out if they can study any interesting for them subject. One of the reasons for that is very simple and obvious - when applying for a job one is more likely to be judged by his/her practical skills and certainly not university degree.
At the current rate of mankind's progress, modern life has turned into a serious competition and it takes a lot more than just knowledge in a subject to win the race. There is no discipline, among all those taught at university, that has been made to teach a student how to fight the ""private wars"", resist temptations, peer presure and all the other not-so-pleasant parts of everyday life.
A degree in mathematics, history or physics can never prepare one to survive in a twentyfirst century jungle or at least face up to the hardships, which are going to hit him/her like a high- speed train, just in a couple days after graduation. We must all be ready and expect anything - from the worst to the best - and throughout the years it has become more than obvious, that there is only one place where we can be taught that: it is called ""the school of life""!
Unfortunately, it happens so that a great part of the students become to a big extend disillusined about what is coming their way after five or seven years of digging into books and taking exams with good marks. Some even have no clue exactly what kind of job they will be looking for or what their goals as individuals are! This fact itself speaks clearly enough of the efficiency of university education. Though the solid background of knowledge in a certain sphere is of great importance, and should not be underestimated, it is simply not enough to make a student be aware of what is in store for him/her.
For well-known reasons a lot of students take up part-time jobs in their free time and thus come to gradually gain more knowledge of what is to be expected from them. Some other have a year of practical education in the course of their studies, but they are only a small per cent of the mass.
However, drawing conclusions and making negative statements, about the lacks and imperfections of the educational system will not lead to any significant progress. Instead it can only prevent us from making any positive change! What we should actually emphasize on are the ways and means to achieving a new image status of higher education. This is of great importance as the biggest per cent of young people, who refuse going to university, do so mainly because of the image formed in their minds. Therefore we should strive to build an entirely new way of perception regarding the issue of a top level education.
The plain truth is that without improved practical skills one will find it very hard to give a certain form to his/her ground of knowledge in the tough conditions of everyday life. When exposed to the stress, constant quarrels and raging tension of the competition in our modern world, in most cases, the newly graduated student will be able to do nothing else but question him/herself why s/he is not prepared for it or how come that s/he failed after all the years of studying.

What is the purpose of education? To provide us with knowledge that, together with our tastes, will help us take the profession that best sorts our abilities. A good university degree should serve as a 'passport' to decent jobs within the range of one's qualification. All this means that university and real life should be in constant feed back. What we have, though, today is education that often loses track of reality, and degrees that indicate how does one manage on one's exams and with one's papers and thesis. Degrees have nothing to do with our capability for a certain job.
Take, first, the present situation in Bulgaria as a whole. In the period of what we think, and hope, to be a transition to a free-market economy, education gradually lost its position of a primal value in people's lives. In its place came 'free initiative', and a lot of people (including the young) gave themselves to amassing money through trade which often turned out to be nothing mote than a swindle . Aversion from study can be rooted in the fact that while you study, you do not earn money, but only accumulate knowledge and prepare for a future job. The deeper reason, though, must lie in the nature of education itself. The reason, it seems to me, is namely its irrelevance to life. You have to know what you study for, in the first place. In Bulgaria, we know that the moment we graduate we will be confronted by the risk of entering the army of unemployed. Our good diplomas will remain but a record on paper. And even if that does not happen, we are still very likely to take jobs that have nothing to do with what we had studied for. With all that in mind you soon end up asking yourself, 'Why study?'.
If, on the other hand, we take an inside look at the way study is being organised, we will soon notice a certain formula shared between students and lecturers. The time spent at university should prepare students for making well at their exams and, possibly, for writing good papers. Not a thought for students' future appliance. In such situation everyone has to take care of themselves, which not always gives the best of results.
To make the picture more complicated still, universities do not keep record of the demands of society. On many subjects the curricula still need updating, with others the problem is the vast number of students on admission. Very few of them will find job relevant to their study because all the vacancies have already been filled in by students who have graduated a couple of years ago.
The most natural thing for the universities to do would be to keep in touch with all the big and minor companies, all the national institutions, plus various foundations and committees and make a running record of their demands and offers on the one hand, and of students' capacities on the other. Another useful thing to do would be to arrange a system of training courses for students while still in their university. A simile of such system exists today, but it neither provides us with helpful skills nor enables us to make contacts in the sphere we are put in for a while, so that in the future we could be appointed for a certain position should we be approved. In the sphere of languages, for example, these courses offer you only the option of 'training' yourself for a teacher (as if a specialist in English or German or any other language and literature can do nothing else!).
I do not know how things are in the sphere of law (one of the trendiest subjects nowadays, together with economics and a few more), but I cannot believe that students there have much wider range of opportunities to choose from.
Universities are not the only to blame. The whole arrangement (or rather disarrangement of our society is such that some very important links are missing - either cut or not yet woven into the new network. Thus, what we need is a through and complete reform both inside the educational system and outside, in the society. It involves a hard work to do, but the result may prove worth the efforts so that one day we could claim to have put into practice the Latin proverb ' We study for life' not for study itself""!

There are certain people who will easily posit the argument: ""You do not necessarily have to be an Einstein to be an Onasis: you do not need this gone-with-the-wind nonsense to succeed in real life"". If we are to adopt or refute this standpoint, we need to answer the following questions: why is higher education so deeply rooted and why has it turned into such a vast social and cultural phenomenon; what is theoretical and what is real and practical; what would happen to society if there were no degrees at all; what is the social ""value"" of the degree itself.
It is axiomatically true that the quest for knowledge has brought our civilisation where it is now.
From the first tottering steps of the Dark Ages, through the envigorating power of the Enlightenment, to the Industrial and Technological revolutions, human knowledge has been gaining momentum.
At first, human development had reached a point when knowledge was no longer mythological but empirical. It needed not only to be stored, but reproduced and ""nurtured"". For this cycle to be closed the appropriate institutions needed to be set up. So around the 12th century universities became a fact. This was not due to the whim of some senile scholar, nor was it due to the fact that knowledge was too practical and needed to be side-tracked and made abstract and theoretical. On the contrary, the emergence of academic education and academic degrees is marked with the interaction of particular political, social and cultural progresses.
And if the label ""founded in the 12th c."" is not enough we need to skip a few centuries to render the words of the sceptics a nullity. The ""Big Bang"" of university education was during the Enlightenment and the Renaissance. This institution survived even the tremendous social uphevals of the bourgeois revolutions. So, if universities and university degrees were such a worthless and theoretical things, why did they not cease to exist?
But let us leave the past long lost and try to gain some insight on the present. Let us assume for a moment that there were no university degrees to gain in the first place, no ""theoretical"" nonsense, just pure, unadulterated practically acquired skills. Will we not all be turned into a bunch of half literate artisans? And needless to say, our cultural and intellectual needs will be sufficed by sheepish contemplation...
There are already too many people who earn their living by using practically acquired skills.
Mental skills on the other hand, being much more troublesome and time-consuming to master are more of a RARA AVIS. Therefore, it is only logical that the lower down the social hierarchy you get, the less educated people are; and vice versa - the higher the social ladder you climb, the greater the number of people with university degrees. Thus, these so-called ""theoretical"" degrees are an essential lever for gaining social prominence.
The conclusion is more than simple. If you do not fancy the idea of ""high-flying"", then stick to the obvious, be ""practical"" and get yourself a low-qualification job. In this way you will be at liberty to gain whatever 'practical"" skills you like; you will have the absolute freedom to thrust yourself into ""real life"".

It is a fact that even well-educated people find themselves in a state of bewilderment at the mere thought of the speed in which technologies are revolutionizing the world. and no wonder, for I doubt it that there is anyone who hasn't been plagued with this feeling of uncertainty. It is, therefore, only natural that the effect of the so-called technological threat be exaggerated.
Obviously, if we are to avoid the hazard of falling into much extremes we need to find reasonable answers to the following questions: why is this negativistic attitude against technologies taking place' how can analogical events in the past help us evaluate the present situation; why are not technologies overpowering the human mind; why are people afraid of the technological advent.
If we are to assume that technological progress and human imagination are two irreconcilable things, then we would imminently affiliate ourselves to the Romantic conceptions or even the Luddite attitude. This rage-against-the-machine phenomenon is on a par with primitive myth- making. Moreover, the trends which trigger this kind of attitude can even be traced back to a cheap horror story. Why? The answer here is fear - fear of the unknown. Just like Medusa in the myths of the ancient Greeks, the embodiment of ultimate evil, or even the gruesome monster in Bram Stoner's novel. These two examples both lead us to one and the same conclusion. People tend to generalize their fear in a flat black-and-white image. This also holds true for the stereotypes that have been built up to sum up the three-dimensional technological reality into a distorted one-dimensional concept. And what happens if this image is reduced to a terrifyingly intelligent machine which lurks the infinite paths of the informational highway? From this starting point it is not hard to jump to the conclusion that technologies may impair our mental abilities.
People are afraid of technological progress and claim that this threatens the human faculty. This is ludicrous, just as ludicrous as the primitive aggression of the Luddites on 19th century machinery. They believed that the machines are responsible for unemployment. Others believe that technology threatens to overpower their imagination. Unemployment than was due to mass migration to the cites. Deficiency of thought and lack of imagination is due to entirely personal characteristics.
As it was stated before, people are afraid of the unknown. It isn't hard for the half-informed to see a horrifying image of the near technologically wise future. But to think of a future world where machines are the decision-makers, where humans are reduced to mere walking extensions can hardly be acceptable with no amount of reasonable doubt. The reason why this can hardly be anticipated is the fact that the human mind is irreplaceable. It cannot become the author of its own creation. Whatever marvelous machinery is to be invented in the future, it will always be a byproduct inferior to the capacity of human imagination. What is more, imagination itself is so tightly intermingled with emotions that sometimes no distinct borderline can be drawn between the two. And emotions are often too subtle to be felt, let alone created.
People are sceptical about new technology because they are not equipped with the necessary knowledge to handle it. Being informed helps you avoid potential threats in using any technology, whether it be household appliances or sophisticated virtual reality products. This is analogous to driving a car wit or without a driving permit. Therefore, it is not knowing the rules of these man- made ""tools"" that is the cause for alarm. And a tool is simply a utility. It does not threaten to replace one's imagination. On the contrary, it helps both mind and imagination along the tortuous path of perfection.
Indeed, one must always have a ""luddite"" within him and not take things for granted. This is so, because like any revolution, the technological one has its aftermath. And it can be disasterous if the necessary precautions are not undertaken. But does that mean we have to shut our eyes to the blatant thruth and pretend that technologies do not exist? Besides, we have many other things to fear. You only have to turn on the eight o'clock news...

The History of mankind is a container of innumerable events that form the image of the planet as an alive and lively ball. Step by step human beings have pushed their way forwards, form the dawn of absolute ignorance and darkness to the hi-tech 'paradise'. Man has succeeded to come out of the Dark Ages due to his imagination and dreams; they served as a basis for further development in every direction. With the help of human brain and logical thinking our world today is one of industrialization, technology and science. It is important to state it clear that without imagination and dreams humans are helpless and would lack creativity and skills so much needed as motivation and mental explanation of scientific discoveries.
There is no doubt that when modern world is compared to the Dark Ages, at all costs, the priority is given to the presence. But these present days could have been different if there had not been imagination and dreams. It is another matter if someone say nowadays people lack fantasy and have no more dreams. Certainly the blame is to be put on the fruits of man's work and struggle to win the battle of survival. However, progress is due to many things among which imagination and dreams should be put.
In a world of automation, human relations seem to have become sort of automatic, machine-like and cold. Why is it so? All products are aimed to comfort people and provide them with convenient appliances. Surely it decreases the stress and tension, but making it easy for men they become lazy and lose the guts to invent more. Of course this is only an observation, but if people have dream houses provided with all the necessary items that one can think of, they may cut all contacts with the neighbourhood and shut the door of normal communication. Because this satisfaction is available at home.
Yet people should not forget their dreams, they should not cease to imagine things, or life will become dull and grey despite the results of human progress. Otherwise humans will be looking more like robots and cold machines than real human beings.
If some people say that today there is no place for dreams and imagination, it means that there is a trend to change the humane apparatus within humans themselves. This fact reveals the existence of a number of people who believe that modernisation and science shove off dreams and imagination. These people are prone to change their mind and soul. But they are not aware of the danger they are unconsciously willing to accept.
Man should not forget his history. He ought to look ahead and move forward, but looking back does not equal to stepping back. Humans should be aware of the value of imagination, because it was their imagination combined with rational and genius thinking that set up science and all inventions for the betterment of living standards. And dreams are motives to search in the future, to look for perfection. Unless people imagine and dream, there will be no progress, no industrialization, no science, no hi-technology - nothing. Everything will be over at the dead line.

BGSU1077,2.5,,,,,,Most University degrees are theoretical and do not prepare us for the real life. Do you agree or disagree?,"
I do not think that this statement is relevant. People go to university in order to broaden their view of the world, their knowledge and understanding in the given academic field. Theoretical degrees are theoretical because of the very nature of the subjects - history, politology, philosophy or even mathematics have more to do with theses, suppositions, ideas, or opinions. To be a bit ""patriotic"" in a way: English and American studies deals with language and culture of the English speaking world (or at least part of it) and as such conatins a great deal of practical work. Translation prepares students for becoming translators some time in the (near) future; integrated skills (the subject) helps in expanding our knowledge of language giving the possibility to become an interpreter, and the third and the most evident one: becoming a teacher in English. Students in the fourth year have obligatory practice in grammar schools to see what teaching is all about. For most of them, this is the first time to meet kids in the classroom; to sit there not as a pupil but as the adult-participant, the ""leader""; the teacher.
But... is it the so-called real life? Is the ""practical"" aspect of the curriculum equal to the preparation for real, everyday-situations? Situations you have to face, you have to cope with? I
am not so sure. For me, ""real life"" can be ANYTHING - from living and working in a cruise liner to the recluse-like existence of the scholars. I am certain that eighty percent of my colleagues would not choose teaching as a lifelong occupation.
What about the rest? Well, maybe - they get prepared for 'their' real life. Although most university degrees are really theoretical it is extremely absurd to draw the consequences; i.e. to claim that ""they are therefore of very little value.""
If you build a house, it is not enough only to find the tools, the materials, or the workers; without accurate planning and thorough land survey (* geology, geognosy!!) even a one-storied building would collapse. You just cannot separate the two. There will always be thinkers, planners, generators along with ""makers"", executors, technicians on the other side, of course.
The problem maybe is not that of quality but quantity. Yes, there will be thinkers and there will be makers. But you always need much more people to build the house than to draw its plans.
People who attend universities somewhat feel privileged - we, students; would-be scholars (or sailors) tend to think of ourselves as chosen ones overlooking the fact that life itself will select the "" elite"" when we will have to prove and justify that the five years of our lives are valuable and ""remunerative"".
Therefore, in a way, the question covers two parallel levels; the level of society - human being in general and the level of the individual. Theoretical kind of faculties are necessary from the point of view of the entire human race, but it depends on the certain student whether he or she will make good use of all the knowledge acquired at universities.

Long, freesing winter nights in the Middle Ages somewhere in Europe (why the Middle Ages? -
even in the last century) passed with plucking of feathers and story telling in the peasant world.
Every village had its own story teller; usually an old men or woman with inexhautible supply of tales and of colourful personality. No radio, no television - only a simple human being and the feathers around him. And the audience believed almost everything - witches, imps, goblins and dragons just as princes and kings.
Nowadays, we simply do not have the time to sit around and believe every single word our story- teller tells us. Are there any story-tellers at all? Yes, I think. There are fewer of them, but still: Spielberg is a story-teller, Kate Bush is a story-teller, Astrid Lindgren is a story teller.
O.K. we have been taught that witches do not exist (anymore?). Then why do we shiver when a black cat crosses the road before us? Superstitions still have a great influence on our everyday life. The answer is simple: there are still so many things science is unable to explain; mysterious, strange phenomena that we cannot put in any categories.
Technology has taught us to take up another pace of living but it does not mean the end of imagination; it does not kill our dreams. On the contrary: new forms of imagination has been created. Let us return to Spielberg's tales: with the help of Hollywood - supertechnology, through visual effects we do believe in Hook or Indiana Jones. Anyway, who claims that our world is dominated by science? It is not so at all. Our world is dominated by money, power and corruption.
(What about the seals, the whales, the seagalls? If science really were in such a key position they would not be endangered and close to extinction!) Technology gave us Virtual Reality: the newest challenge of the restless minds. Computer-generated fantasies, three-dimentional adventures, freely cutting through space and time leaving our bodies behind. As if we attempted to really follow our own minds running at top speed by turning on the machine.
Television or movies may put limitations on imagination (or even kill it) but Virtual Reality is something different. It is you who generates the scenes, directs visions and sounds in ""autocratic"" order.
There is a place for dreaming and imagination just because it is an integral part of human nature, no matter to what extent science or technology (or even industialisation would gain ground in our world. The setting changes - the main point remains the same: without dreams and imagination there is no humanity.

Whether university degrees should pay greater attention to theoretical of rather to practical side of things is a question wich lately seems to turn into a major topic of discussion in university circles and among students themselves. It seems that as one goes on with his studies, as he goes deeper into things he realizes how little he knows. And this might result into some lack of self confidence. It depends on the kind of person, of course. But, however, when too much emphasis is put on the theoretical side of things and the practical one is somewhat neglected - this might lead to an undesirable effect that is, for example the lack of self confidence I mentioned earlier. What I mean actually is that when you are offered a job, for an instance, you usually start hesitating, asking yourself the question whether you could deal with what you are expected to.
'Am I suitable for this job? I've never done it before I'm not sure I'll be successful... Should I take the risk or not? But if I fail...' The list of questions of this sort might be infinite. Of course, you may not have any considerable reason for feeling such a lack of self-confidence but the very fact that thoughts like these occur to you comes to tell us that university education should be more practical-oriented. Because this uncertainty springs from your inexperience. All you have is the theoretical background but this doesn't seem to be enough.
I do not regect the importance of theory, of course. It is actually theory what practice is based on. But what seems to be a problem is the lack of balance between theory and practice. It is very often the case that much more attention is paid to the theoretical side of things rather than to the practical one. In my opinion it should be the other way or at least some balance and equality bethween things should be achieved.
That theory should always be combined with practice seems to be out of question. It is true that theory is the basis but practice turns to be much more important in real life. I do not mean, of course, that theory is unimportant. It is important but book-knowledge is not enough to make a person prepared for the real world.
When I was a first year student I had a lecturer who would say that University Degrees are predominantly theoretical and gradually we turn into ""book-learning mice"". He was trying in a sort to warn us: ""Please, have this in mind. Try to prevent yourselves. Do not become 'slaves' of theory because one day you'll find your hands in chains, i.e. you'll find yourself completely unprepared for the real world because you'll feel incertain about the practical side of things. But actually, very little of what you've studied in theory would be of value."" But at the same time he was fully aware that this would be very difficult because it is the system of organization, the way of teaching in universities that is to blame.
Of course, there is another factor that contributes to this neglect of practical side of things - the omnipotent money... Everything more-or-less depends on money and when it is missing...
things do not go in the right way. Unfortunately, what is said in a song that money makes the world go round appears to be true, at least to some extent. And in this particular case when talking about practical and theoretical side of University Degrees it is the practice that demands a lot of money - different kinds of equipment which usually takes a considerable amount of money...
And maybe it is partly for this reason that University Degrees are theoretical rather than practical.
But although the practical side of things is somewhat neglected hardly it can be said that theoretical knowledge is of no value. Of course, there are a lot of things which won't be of any use in real life. Besides, real life is full of surprises - good or bad. And eventually you may find yourself unpreparated to meet them, not ready to cope with all sorts of problems practical life would offer you. And then, theory is not enough - practice turns to be the missing key to the solution of the problem. So, when this key is not there, in your head, the door cannot be opened.
And if we assume that this door is your book-knowledge - something which has been built up slowly, brick after brick then it wouldn't be of real use if it remains closed. So, practice comes a little bit later, it is based on theory but theory without practice is incomplete. Practising of things appears to be more important that their theoretical learning.

Most people's ultimate aim is to achieve something prestigious in life. Nowadays such results could be produced mainly through profound knowledge. This is maybe the main stimulus that makes young people apply to different universities and do their best to be admitted in some of them. Therefore what students expect to acquire at these institutions is knowledge that can help them in their future profession. Many of the university degrees, however, prove to be abundant in theoretical knowledge but lacking in practice. This differs from what students expect to get therefore lessens the value of the university degrees.
Most university courses are oriented to a lot of reading of theoretical books. This undoubtedly enlarges one's knowledge about a particular subject or subjects and therefore couldn't be considered as useless. Yet one could hardly be able to achieve success if he doesn't know how to apply his knowledge to real world, that is, how to practice what he knows. His theoretical information proves to be, after all, passive and it would require a lot of time to reactivate it and put it to use or learn how to employ it most successfully. And this is not what employers need - they want people who will be really efficient in their work and will not wonder how to do a simple thing though knowing a lot of theoretical information about it. It is like being able to use just one of you hands.
In many of the university courses, at least some practice is involved but it is not quite enough. It is, of course known that one can learn how to do a certain thing mainly and almost only through practice. a person wouldn't succeed in translating texts, for example, if he had never made translations before; or a lawyer wouldn't know how to proceed in court if he had never, at least, assisted in such an activity. Nobody learns how to do a thing merely through watching.
Yet I wouldn't claim with absolute certainty that theoretical degrees are of very little value.
To start with I could point out the fact that though some of them are really theoretically-oreinted, they have their benefits. They undoubtedly develop a person's ability to think, to reach conclusions, to be creative. This is really useful and necessary in many cases.
This exactly is my second point - there are lots of jobs nowadays that require theoretical knowledge because their very essence is theoretical. Different kinds of research work, for example, would require one's knowledge about them and in case one needs some more information, they will certainly know how to find it having done this many times before. Here, in fact, theory and practice are interrelated.
For a third note I would point out the fact that it is much easier to reactivate one's knowledge than to start from scratch and know absolutely nothing. Though it would prove a bit difficult at first a person who graduates from a university is expected to be capable to cope quickly with such a situation.
What finally I come to is the conclusion that in fact theoretical degrees are not really useless. Besides, there is in fact at least some practice involved in all university courses. On the other hand, it is by no means enough and therefore satisfactory. I would certainly say that more practice is undoubtedly needed because it is indispensable to a person's progress. the purpose of the university degrees is after all to help those who get them as much as possible.

BGSU1082,3.0,3.0,,,,,"Some people say that in our modern world, dominated by science and technology and industrialisation, there is no longer a place for dreaming and imagination. What is your opinion?","
What one would expect to find in a world full of diversities is various kinds of phenomena and people. People indeed are different and that is the reason why there are so many diversities.
Yet people are quite identical in many respects as well. For example, we all breathe, move, talk, sleep, laugh, eat, dream. Yes, dreaming, in my opinion, is a characteristic inherent to all human beings and no matter what the surrounding circumstances are, they all perform that function.
Science, technology and industrialisation are indeed the results achieved by our human progress. Science gives reasonable explanations to many natural, social etc. phenomena; Technology creates things one have never before thought about; industrialisation, a product of the combination of the above mentioned, starts being really wide-spread. All this is an obvious fact and nobody could deny it. Yet I cannot help thinking this would never make people stop dreaming.
What is typical of each human being is the innate desire to know more and more about the world, to question everything existing and yet not to be satisfied - with what he or she has already found out. Then how could science provide detailed information about all the questions that arise in people's minds? People could ask about a different thing every time and even though science can offer some explanations, they will inevitably bring up new problems. It is well known that human imagination has no limits and therefore the flow of questions will never run dry.
The same refers to technology. There may be new technological discoveries every day.
They may be perfect and probably offer you a picture of yourself walking on the surface of Mars or even you may spend some minutes in 2020. But will it be absolutely real? No, it won't and you will still dream of what you have seen to come true with the help of new technologies. Moreover, having tasted something once nobody will ever be satisfied by a thing equal in effect to the previous one. So he will go on dreaming about new things trying to think of something really different which technologies, no matter how perfect they are, will not be able to present to you.
The situation with the industrialisation does not differ in anyway. With the intensive industrial development the supply of goods is by all means much better. Yet material comfort is not all we need. What is more, industrialisation itself raises quite a lot of problems and brings about changes in environment. They make you want something better, you imagine better things, you dream about them.
So what we finally arrived at is the conclusion that things like science, industry and technology can never satisfy people's needs and desires completely and therefore cannot be a reason that will make people stop dreaming. They, in fact, turn into incentives to even wilder dreams. Imagination can never stop operating. And people can never stop dreaming about and imagining things. Those who hold this opinion are, it seems, too busy proving their theory and therefore not paying attention to the fact that they dream as well. Because everybody, for certain, dreams and will go on doing so in the future.

Parents rely on education to prepare their children for the real world. Techers warn us that the lack of education will hamper our future development. The whole society beseeches us - the young people - to stay in school because nowadays our future depends more than ever before on our education. But is it really so?
Most people view the years spent at university as the happiest in their lives. The first word that comes to their minds when asked about these years is freedom. Freedom from parental guidance, no more obligatory attendance, endless parties. In short, they were left to their own devices. When I entered university I expected it to be the same with me. As far as life outside university is concerned, my expectations are fulfulled. But as far as the curriculum is concerned there is much left to be desired. It is made in advance and I am bereft of the opportunity to decide for myself which courses to attend and where to focus my attention. It is as if I am back in my schooldays again.
The aim of my secondary education was, it seems to me, to help me to do as well as possible in my entrance exams for the university. The aim of my higher education is to get a university degree that will help me to get as good a job as possible. But I wonder if there are enough good jobs for all university graduates. It will be most unfair for some to get good jobs and others to have to join the dole queue, since they all have studied the same things - what the professors told them in their lectures. Thus, we tuch upon another poignant problem - the lectures.
The most widely used method of teaching is by giving lectures - a professor gathers students in a large lecture-hall and gives them a summary of what he or she has read. But is that the most effective way of imparting knowledge? Most certainly, not. Knowledge is best acquired in small groups where everyone is paid enough attention to and discussions are encouraged.
Students should be given different points of view and should be encouraged to think and decide for themselves whose point of view to subscribe to. You can ensure your passing an exam by quoting your professor's views on the subject but it is in the real life, where there is no one to tell you what is right and what is wrong, that the abilities to think critically, to approach problems logically, to use reasoning will come in useful.
Apart from being a place where one can acquire knowledge, university should be a place where one can acquire certain skills, the most important of which are the skills to learn, to adapt and to choose and defend one's choice. These can be developed through various activities, for example through role play and problem solving. The opportunity of young ingenious people gathered together should be grabbed at. Seminars should be more like workshops. You can acquire all the theoretical knowledge you will ever need on your own. On the contrary you can never learn how to adapt, to communicate and to make the right choice by yourself.
In conclusion, I will not go to such extremes as to declare nihilistically that university does not prepare me for the real world in the least. But unless the educational system is changed radically, there will soon be hundreds of people with university diplomas hanging on the wall but unable to cope well in the real world. We do not need people who can repeat lectures parrot fashion but people capable of thinking.

Most of the young Bulgarian people apply for the University after they graduate high school. To be a student is very prestigious and promising. People desire to study in the University not only because it is fashionable but because they hope that university education will guarantee them a prosperous job and a better future. Unfortunately, today we are living in a time of change.
In our country chaos and injustice reign. The people who live at ease are narrow-minded people, with limited education and a criminal record. Nevertheless, the young generation believe that there will soon come the time when things will change for the better, our country will get on its feet again and the educated and ambitious people will regain the deserved leading position in society.
Bulgarian people have confidence in University education. Parents are ready to pay the great fees and help their children study at the university. People struggle with the unemployment with the means of University eduacation. Specialists have a greater chance to find a good permenant job than uneducated people. It is important to have a University education even when private business is concerned. For example, the owners of pharmacies must have a high medical education in order to be allowed to be in charge of it. Otherwise they should have a person with the special education for that job.
University education in Bulgaria takes into consideration the necessities of real life. Most university sciences have their practical part. Students have lectures and seminars and seminars are twice as much as the lecture classes. Students have chances to practise what they have learned, and to learn new things while practising. The theory of the science is just a part of the whole knowledge they receive of it. For example, philology students are not limited with reading only their lectures and science fiction but they have to read periodicals as well, so that they will enlarge their vocabulary with up-to-date words and will become competent in the problems of the present day. They also have the chance to brush up their pronunciation in phonetic laboratories where they can listen to different accents and pronunciations and can record their own speech.
Young philologists recieve the oportunity to specialise in one subject - translation, grammar, literature, and to have extra practise in these field of study. At the end of their university education they are sent to practise the job of teachers in the local schools and there they meet with students face to face, and amass experience. Moreover, the exams they sit for consist of two parts - theoretical and practical.
The other university subjects are also concerned with student's realisation in life. Medical students have a lot of classes in laboratories, they are obliged to work in probation in hospitals ever summer. So are the journalist students. They have to be probationers in a publishing house.
Therefore, Bulgarian University education is of great value and it prepares students for their future life as specialists.

We are living in a world of rapid development of science technology and industrialisation.
Everyday there is another invention in the field of science. Almost every product has a mechanical manifacture. The machines in the factory are so improved that they can operate even without the interference of man. Mechanization finds its place also in the sphere of services and education. Computers are wildly used in administration buildings, culture, schools and universities.
Science inventions save people's time, makes their lives easier and comfortable. For instance, in the factories, the machines operating in the manifacture save a lot of money and time to the owners. If the work done by the machines had to be done by people there would be spent more time for the production and the owner of the factory would need a large sum of money for the workers' salaries. Another instance in favour of science technology is the improvement of household devices. With the inventing of microwaves, the housewife saves precious time which she could spend, for example with her children.
The vast industrialisation and the development of science technology intend to change people's life for the better but they have also their negative impact on life and habbits. The mechanization in the factories causes a decrease in workers number, and therefore is one of the reasons for the unemployment. Mechanical devices at home has changed people's habbits.
People have become lazier and apathetic. They will prefer to stay at home, watching TV or using their computers instead of going for a walk, meeting friends, communicate with the members of their families. The technological inventions - television, radio, video, computers make people over informed. There is almost nothing that can surprise them. People has become more serious and practical.
Every time has its leading field of human achievements. For example, the time will give birth to brilliant writers or painters, philosophers or musicians. It is a fact that a few great names of culture are our contemporaries. Science technology is the leading field in which our genial contamporaries manifest themselves. But it doesn't mean that modern world suffer a decline in culture. A lot of talented people work for the prosperity of culture. Most of them use the inventions in technology in order to improve their creations. For instance, musicians improve the sound, record remixes, produce various noises with the help of modern technology. The director manages to make his film closer to reality, impressive and shocking due to computer graphics, mechanization and the improvement of the make-up. Therefore science technology is a great help for the art.
To sum up I will say that to my opinion modern technology and industrialization can't have a perilous influence on human beings. It can change their habbits, preferences but not their nature. For me, people who say that industrialization and modern technology will kill dreaming and imagination are wrong. Man has never stopped to be a dreamer and imaginer. These are characteristic features of human's nature that will never die. The development of science technology is a product of man's imagination and is a manifestation of man's dream for a better world.

During the 20th century so many scienific discoveries and technological innovations were made that it is not a surprise that we are often said to live in a technological era. These developments changed our life radically and to some people the advance of the new technologies became a cause for frustration and even fear. Consequently, the new products have been attacked for different reasons, one of them being the allegedly damaging effect on human's imagination.
In my opinion this attack is ungrounded because of two main reasons: first of all, imagination is an essential part of human nature and can never perish, and, secondly, there are numerous manifestations that our imagination is still active and productive.
Imagination is what makes us dream or fear, what helps us go beyond appearences and see beauty or ugliness even in ordinary things. It makes us create works of art or just imaginary worlds, it provokes our fantasies. No man is immune to imagination. Of course, some people imagine more vividly than others but still there is not a person completely deprived of imagination.
The word is usually associated with the artistic mind but the greatest innovations too, are a product of the creative thinking of mathematicians, physicists, chemists etc. Science depends on the imagination as much as the art does. The progress of mankind is the product of the creativity of daring persons. Who would have thought a telephone, a most trivial object today, possible some two hundred years ago? It would have sounded like a crazy idea of a lunatic. Still, the creativity of inventors, the need to progress, the hope for a better future have made, not only telephone but also much more complex machines, a reality. The capacity of the human mind to dream and create is the reason for the great technological and industrial progress of the modern world. Moreover, the constant development of science and the appearance of new products which we witness today, proves that imagination is not only alive but even more fertile than before.
Ironically, the development of science has fostered our imagination by provking two basic reactions: fear and hope. Some people are afraid of a possible future, dominated by machines which will take over humanity, while others dream of a blessed time when technological progress will make our lives happier, easier and longer. These reactions are so strong that they led to the flourishing of the science-fiction genre in the 20th century. Apart from being closely connected with scientific development, imagination still reigns in the sphere of art. There are no proofs that the artstic mind in our century is less productive than during the preceding centuries. On the contrary, works of art are constantly being created, galleries and music halls attract admirers.
Books are read and Nobel Prizes for literature are still awarded despite the undergrounded fear from the advance of television and video. The new technologies have created the new genres of film, computer animation, electronic music which also show many fine examples of the power of human imagination.
In this sense, in the modern world imagination finds even more ways to express itself.
The creative power of human mind can never be suppressed because men will never give up their efforts to make their life better and more beautiful.

Most people go to university to prepare themselves for a future career or at least because they are interested in a particular area of study. To become specialists they need an academic education and in this sense the university is the only means by which they can achieve their goal.
In my opinion the degree they receive is essential for their future career.
Of course, the knowledge students have acquired should be put into practice after graduation. At this point some find out that their expectations do not match with the real world.
However, one should not rely entirely on the degree to cope with the situation. Experimenting, practice, learning from one's own mistakes is needed to suceed on the working place. These are things that one discovers for oneself and that cannot be taught. There is not such a degree which can fully prepare us for life. The best of educations will not help a person succeed if he or she is uncooperative but has to work in group. The degree is the background we need but it is us who have to learn how to cope with reality. That is why I think that university degrees are far from being worthless.
There are majors that can be called ""more theoretical"" than others. For example, studying Philosophy or History means studying mainly theory while Medicine involves a lot of practice. For some areas of study practice is much more important than in others and that is why we should not expect the same ratio practice:theory in each field. Moreover, the theoretical fields prepare students for the real world in a different way. By encouraging them to think critically, organise and express their thoughts orally or in written form, make comparisons and associations, use logic or imagination, they prepare them not only for their career but also for life as a whole. Those are qualities which are essential for managing even in the most difficult situations.
Many majors produce mainly teachers, lecturers, writers or just theoreticians. For these professions practice, too, is needed but a deep knowledge of theory is essential.
On the other hand, practical excercise is crucial for other fields of study like Performing Arts, Fine and Applied Arts, Dentistry, Computer Programming etc. There is no doubt that after graduation, a student in one of these fields will be well prepared for his or her future work.
However, even those majors can not do without theory. For medical students, for example, theoretical knowledge is no less important than practical skills.
The value of university degrees is not in their being theoretical or practical. In one way or another every academic education will help a student to cope better with the real life. The most important thing is that the graduates are good specialists in their field and intelligent, independly thinking, self-confident human beings.

The very basis of the science, technology and industrialization is the dream and the imagination. The strive to achieve something better, to attack the impossible has brought about innovations in technology and science.
The primitive man did simple things like breeding, eating, sleeping and dreaming.
Dreaming is in our nature. Being the unsatiable people that we are we always look for things we do not have or cannot have and envisage them. No matter how modern and sophisticated the world becomes we will always fancy images.
It can be argued that not all fantasize and that there are people who never do it.
However, the former is not related to technology at all. It is supposed to be a characteristic of a certain person though I myself have never met anyone who does not built castles in the air even if it is very rarely.
I believe the imagination must be stimulated. If it is not than it does not function ""preperly"". There is no one who can claim that modern science and technology stimulate the mind less than did the objects that existed when the world was primitive. It is true that the type of dreams and images might have changed but certainly the faculty of the imagination as the romanticists called it has not disappeared.
Often people try to bring their dreams into reality. For example so many ancient myths were concerned with wings and flying ships. Nowdays we have planes as part of our everyday culture. But today some dream of being able to fly by themselves. To feel the wind brushing their hair as they go higher and higher until there is no gravity and only the sensation of floating and freedom remains. It is quite possible that in the future flying would be an ordinary activity.
This is not to say that I believe it to be a good idea since the sky would certainly become overpopulated and it would be also extremely unpleasant to look up at the clear, blue sky and see figures moving about. But those considerations are really of no significance since the important thing here is that people do dream. The world is too gloomy a place to be left without fantasies.
At the same time our world is not that much dominated by technology. It may seem so compared to other centuries but looking objectively one cannot fail to notice how many new discoveries are needed. Ways of using the sun's energy, or stopping the global warming, effective contraception, cure for aids. Who but someone with imagination would be able to invent remedies?
It is impossible to say that in our world there is no longer place for dreaming. Even during the Industrial revolution when the factory workers slept five hours and slogged all day long, it is undoubtful that they fantasized of better life. And that desire human beings will always continue to have.

At the turn of the twentied century it appears as more and more important to receive a narrowly specialized education. Employers look for specialists, let say, in animal bones or Medieval Scottish Archaeology. The study of such subjects requires a very deep knowledge in a sphere which presents not more than a drop in the ocean of world affairs.
Moreover, great part of the education given at the Universities (especially in Bulgaria), is oriented towards theory and in most of the cases has nothing to do with what a graduate must face in his/her real work.
It is still estimated that university means science and all subjects at a university should concern mainly theoretical issues.
This is the reason why, the Classical Philology at Sofia University is a subject which main concerns are theoretical grammar and an obligatory list of authors, unchangeable on any grounds. Consequently, they have a very small number of students, all coming from the Classical High School (the entrance exam is in Latin and Greek).
All this ends with a lack of interest on the part of the students, dissatisfaction on that of the teachers and leads towards the extinction of the 'Mother of all Philologies'.
The Department of English and American Studies provides more practical classes. Some of them really manage to help students in the mastering of such a rich and complex language as English.
Nevertheless, ninety percent of the classes as a whole, remain purely theoretical.
Undergraduates discover, to their great surprise, that theoretical syntax, morphology and theoretical grammar are to be estimated essential for their knowledge to such extent as to occupy seventy percent of their classes.
While, in the meantime, subjects as British Culture and Society, 19th and 20th century literature or American Culture and Society may be studied one term or one year (two terms) It is no surprise that most of the students attend the very difficult and boring (for not being understandable!) theoretical classes only out of fear of the final, usually 'monstrous' exams.
However, at the end, the degree we achieve, is theoretical and cannot help us much in the 'real life'.
We are not against theory. Theory is what brings the ideas and generates the thinking.
We are looking for a right balance that can give us a competence which to serve our future work.

Busy traffic, noisy cars, noisy tramcars, many people hurrying, passing by each other without even seeing each other's faces... This is what the modern world offers. Of course, air conditioning, fast transport, airplanes, satelite communications and various facilities also.
But what is the place of man among the machines? It seems that the mankind has fallen into a trap laid by its own hand. The faster and modern life, the more confused the man in it. It seems that man has got into a vicious circle with no way out.
Or may be with just one way - inward. For human civilization cannot destroy what it had done up to now or erase its achievements and to a great extent does not have to. It can turn towards its internal forces and, first of all, to its imagination.
Dreaming and imagination have always been dear to man but nowadays thay are not only possible or precious, they are vital.
No matter of technology or the improveament of the industrialization, a starry night remains a starry night.
It seems of no importance that people know the temperature and the radius of a star or that they are aware of the fact that nobody (or nothing) lives on the Moon and that a man had stepped on it.
Still, the stars and the Moon remain the distant romantic 'night lights' of the past.
This may be due to the fact (according to a scientific theory!) the human brain remains unchanged since a certain stage of the evolution. This means that it is not capable of realizing the real change of the world and that the notions of 'good', 'bad', 'beautiful', 'true' or 'untrue' are more or less the same since Ancient Greece.
On the other hand, here comes the unwillingness of man to be 'dehumanized', equated to a machine, deprived of soul and feelings.
All this gives the imagination a great power over human mind and makes it a weapon in the war with the machinery.
Still, imagination is what produces ideas which develop new technology, broaden the field of study of different sciences.
Imagination is what penetrates into the micro-parts of the human body or in the chemical elements. It gazes at the stars and constructs spaceships or draws the plans of futuristic cities in the Ocean or in Space.
It turns out that there is no greater power than human imagination. With one hand it leads the humanity forward and keeps it where it belongs. It composes music and makes arms, heals and kills. Invents witches and robots and undoubtedly rules the life of man. Then, the question is what rules the imagination?

Since time immemorial man has studied everything around him - plants, animals, even stars. It is deeply implanted in the human soul to be curious about all that happenned around and so man made up his mind to found ""schools' where any information could be selected and investigated. These ""proto-universities"" were very useful if anyone wanted to become a scholar investigator , or governor.
But time passed and nowadays a great dilemma props up before us - is our contemporary university education useful? Isn't it too theoretical? Don't we study subjects which cannot even give us basic preparation for life. Isn't it high time that we call a halt and make a profound rearrangement of our whole pattern of education?
The first universities in our point of view were established in Ancient Greece. They were a kind of schools but for advanced ""students"". They taught the young men all that was necessary when they would start to live their lives on their own - even the athletics was a major subject. It was important then - because of the way of life of those times - but now it is even more important - against all kinds of stress and sedentary life. The ancient Greeks knew well that the principle ""know yourself"" - inscribed in their Delphi temple, can bring them only perfection and harmony.
Later the Romans founded universities - but which only resembled the Greek. The Christian universities were predominantly theocratic in the Middle Ages. But later scholasticism gave in and new universities in Italy, Holland and England became the symbol of free spirit and thought in Europe.
But recently we began to realize that something was lost in our education. Didn't it turn to Medieval theoretical studies. Aren't we too far from the real world. In a lot of places the problem is how to make universities more up-to-date, answering the need of modern times.
I am absolutely sure that there is not a single student who is satisfied with all his subjects.
I speak of the average student at a university, even if he takes away all his whims, nevertheless he won't be satisfied. Isn't it time for the teachers, tutors, even politicians in our country to ask themselves what the reason of this is. I think that students should take part in the forming of their programme at least 40 to 60 per cent. A student is not to stay somewhere inbetween but to be a leader in promoting new ideas for education. Moreover that young people are more liberal, with contemporary thinking. Because we need in our education something new.
We not only need change. We want to be well prepared for our mission in world. As Jesus Christ has been sent to save the world, we still have decoded in our minds a little bit of this mission. It would be good to promote it.

Our modern civilization has undergone an interesting development - from the earliest civilizations up till now. Is it a path towards progress, perfection and peace? Is it a march towards freedom, beauty and salvation. Is there any place left in our souls for the spiritual part of ourselves apart from the new technical devices that are manifactured day by day?
Modern world invariably bears the characteristics of science, technology and industrialization. So can we still share our dreaming. Can we use often our imagination as in the dawn of humanity? I think yes. Because if we don't share them, we would turn into machines, robots, operators. It is not good to forget your roots.
A lot of people nowadays consider it best to regard industrial development and computerization as the essential targets of our times. But they often forget that if we neglect our spirituality, our souls, our inmost depths of reality, we come to an absolute danger: to turn inhuman. Because even Jesus used to say that the body is material and only soul can achieve immortality, spirit-heaven.
If we turn into ""technological monsters"" we lose our human essence and stop being homo sapiens. It leads only to war and hatred. We have to be very careful because technology is not a threat to us, it can only help us to achieve a better life, happier life. And as in the Bible ""not man is created for Saturday but Saturday is created for man"" we can paraphrase it relating to the machines. Because God made us create them for our own good but we have to pay attention for their possible danger.
We shouldn't harm our spiritual depths because they are essential for our existence.
They are the only alternative for us in an age of alienation. Through dreaming and our imagination we can be better. Isn't it a nice dream a need for perfection. Isn't it a good imagination showing our preparation for life? They are the inborn traits of our consciousness, a part of ourselves, they make us human.
So we should try to keep them as deep as we can in our ""human resources"". They are our only way to stay human. And the only one alternative not only in past, present but for the future time. And we are convinced of it.

Since the creation of the Earth our planet has been in a constant state of development.
This development has affected all forms of life on the planet. The inhabitants of Earth have had to adapt to abrupt climate changes, natural disasters and the evolution of new species. All these changes have not been able to wipe out life of Earth. That goes to show that the inhabitants of our planet are very agile and resilient. Without doubt the most intelligent form of life on Earth is the human race. It takes most of the credit for the ongoing changes. The human race innovates the environment and incessantly facilitates life conditions by means of employing science, technology and industrialization. But even with the introduction of all these new things the human race does not change in its philosophical approach to life. It continues to pursue the unattainable with incomparable faith, it never ceases to dream and imagine. Dreaming and imagination are essential for our moral achievement as individuals.
At the end of the twentieth century, at the zenith of technology and science we are faced with the philosophical question weather there is any more room left in our lives for dreaming and imagination. Some people think that the introduction of the latest product of science and technology have killed the genuine approach to life. All of the new facilitators have turned people into a lazy and inert race that has no desire to continue to develop. Others feel that the development of science, technology and industrialization is a mere product of human imagination and as long as we continue to prosper in that sphere we are not endangering our moral and spiritual achievement.
In my opinion the domination of the modern world by science, technology and industrialization cannot hurt dreaming and imagination. The reason for that is very simple. Man is above all a human being. He is sensitive to every new change in the world and expresses his sensitivity through his dreams and imagination. Man also has individual characteristics. If some people are deformed by the modern technological world others will not be. The fact that people have their own individual characteristics has always kept a balance in our world. It makes the problems more complex, but gives an objective view on things. To prove that our world has not been robbed of its dreaming and imagination one only has to look at the interests of people.
People nowadays are crazy about entertainment. They go to concerts, football matches, visit art galleries, theatres and read lots of books. This shows that people have a high spirit and will continue to dream and imagine.

BGSU1098,3.0,,,,,,Most University degrees are theoretical and do not prepare us for the real life. Do you agree or disagree?,"
The educational system in a certain country is a major factor in the country's state and development. Education has always been a much discussed and contraversal issue. We scrutanize the educational conditions because our youth will have to be prepared to cope with the difficulties in the real world.
One of the existing contraversal problems concerns our higher education. People doubt the ability of university courses to prepare students for the future. They consider university degrees theoretical and propose to the universities to get engaged with the students into more practical work which will undoubtedly bring experience. I, however, feel that our universities are doing a satisfactory job in preparing their students. Even though our universities and colleges have restricted financial means they prepare their students in an evidable way. The professors and their assistants are erudite and knowledgable. They encourage and win the student's interest thus facilitating the educational process. The only problem, if there is such, is that the courses lack practical work. This, however can be easily solved. Most students have a lot of free time which they can use for their practical work. In this way they will be getting the necessary theoretical preparation at school and will assimilate their knowledge by working. Then, when the students graduate they will be ready to fit into the hierarchy of society. If all of the students are prepared our country will develop quicker and will reach the level of West-European countries in no time. In order for that to happen however, our government has to offer more and more jobs for students. That will get them accustomed to an active life from a young age. It will also decrease the many vices our youth has. Vices are picked up when an individual does not have any interesting thing to do. Work is an excelent solution. It will keep students busy and it will give a lot of helpful experience.
In order for things to be as truly optimistic as I presented them the students must fight a tough battle with their lazy and indifferent coleagues. As long as there are such people in our universities progress will be slown down drastically. The enthusiastic and hard-working students have to win over their coleagues. They have to get them interested in the school courses and help find a suitable job so that they can later fit into our society.

This painful problem has its roots deep in the history of mankind and points back to the time of man's birth. Human nature has two main aspects: the physical and the spiritual - man cannot stop being neither the one or nor the other. Scientific discoveries and technical inventions take an important place in our existence and are absolutely necessary for us to survive in and make our corporeal world more friendly and comfortable to us.
But man's physical existence is just the first side of the problem. The other is man's man's mental, spiritual, inside life which is the most vivid expression of the human soul and the most fertile soil for the growth of imagination.
At first sight it might seem that the two aspects (the physical and the spiritual) live in a conflict with each other but in fact they are not controversial or opposite because imagination not only gives birth to dreams but is also the originator of most of the technical inventions.
Theoretically, the mechanism of inventing smth is very simple: the dream, which is in most of the cases common to a large number of people, materializes into some invention which finally, is a product of the human activity and effort, For example, since man was born in this world he had been dreaming of being able to fly. And now, due to the conscious efforts of scientists, we have planes and rockets - we can travel in space.
And yet the realization of this ""simple"" mechanism is not so easy to fulfil for it requires profound and specialized knowledge in the field of science, excellent analytical abilities, a lot of patience and consistency and many other things which are certainly difficult to achieve.
That is why there were very few genius scientists and inventors who accomplished scientific breakthroughs and contributed a lot to the human history. They had not only a dream but ""a noble aim faithfully kept"" which turned to be ""a noble deed"" ( William Wordsworth: ""a noble aim faithfully kept, is a noble deed""). Perhapse, the future generations will never forget the names of Alexander Graham Bell (who invented the telephone in 1876), or Thomas Alva Edison (most famous for the invention of the light bulb) or Albert Einstein (who formed the theory of relativity and is thought of as being one of the cleverest people ever born), or Marie and Pierre Curie (who invented the X-rays and won the Nobel prize twice). The inventions of genius are considered to be pieces of art and to belong as well to the imaginative part of the human mind.
So far, we can adopt the generalization that the science progress has a lot to do with dreams and imagination, as far as the great scientists are concerned.
But science can be viewed the point of creating it and form the point of consuming. It happens so that technical achievements like many other things, are not always used the way they should be. This means that an invention in the hands of some unconscientious person can turn into an instrument for gaining power of manipulating people in some way. For instance, the newspapers and TV are sometimes used in favour of political or personal interests.
Another problem is the unlimited and uncontrolled spread of the technical innovations.
Nowadays, nearly every child is familiar with computer games, video, Internet etc. which overusing can cause serious helth problems not only to children but to adults too. Some defender of the opposite opinion might claim that this is an individual problem which can be avoid.
But who will protect the cuman culture from the distructive effect of computers, for example, provided that they are everywhere: at home, school, office, shops... everywhere. The today's generation is taught that you must learn computers in order to get the right way to prosperity and to keep in touch with the changing world. Then who will read books and listen to music, and even more frightening, who will WRITE books and COMPOSE music if there is no demand for them?
Hence, my personal opinion is that we should not let neither the rational nor the imaginative part of our mind to predominate and thus we will find a balance between science and art and perhapse we will be able to guide the ways of history. Though it highly depends on the individual if he will lose all his dreams, society is as much responsible for this tendency (if there is such) and that's why everybody should try to do something in order we don't lose completely our human nature.

We live at a time, when machines replace humans in almost all branches of life, a time when the technical progress is so rapid, that we are choking in our tendency for catching it. So many things have been achieved, that harder can something take our breath away. That is why, many of us share the idea, in our World there is nothing to dream of.
Thanks to the Science, plenty of discoveries have been made. But during these years of fast development, we sometimes forget who we are and where we have come from. Engulfed by the rush for success we have made irretrievable wounds to our planet. We have changed the nature - this soil is not that fertile anymore, the World Ocean is polluted and many of the species, inhabiting its waters are disappearing; the deep tropical forests in Brasil and Africa have been destroyed; the Ozon Hole is expending; outbreaks are bursting and terrible earthquakes are shaking our Earth. The chemicals used in industry are the cause for the misery, crimes and starvation, which reign any point of our planet.
Gradually, our life have changed. Enchaned by the achievements in the Science, Medicin, culture and Industry, somehow we lost the best part of our soul - its romantic part! Are those, who think, that in our world there is no place for dreaming are right? They can probably remember the Past. But don't they dream of the endless meadows and lawns, the diamond-clear rivers, the azure blue seas, the abundance of species in the forests? I doubt.
More than a century ago Halliday despised the quick progress in Britain. But then it was just the beginning. Today's life is much more hectic and mechanized. Since then, people were sent to the Space, vaccines against lethal diseases were discovered, bridges were built. The machines we invented help us. They are so delightful, so immaculate, that we have almost fallen in love with them. And often, without realizing it, we behave like them. We use their help everywhere and everytime and they have turned into invaders. Instead of being our friends.
But in spite of all these horrifying results, we do still care of our planet! We haven't lost our feelings and senses, that's why we are better than the machines. We do still possess optimism and belief in the common sense. We can still do something good to alleviate the pains of the Earth and we still have a chance to save its beauties! We must involve all our senses and feelings, all our wit, to kill the Monster we created and in our ambition to make life better and easier. And we won't become its preys, because we are humans - we think, we feel and dream...

Today many people believe that education is a very good investment. A high University diploma can become the basis of your bright future. Therefore, every summer, the brighest students are shaking nervously, before the results are announces. How much tension and excitment!
I do still remember the time I applied to ""St. Kliment Ohridsky"" University. I thought the time had stopped and the day on which the results had to be announced never came. I could not eat, I could not sleep - I lost my desire to do anything, before ""that day"". And all this - in the name of the Good Future! Certainly, with a high diploma, you will find a good job and your life will be a dream. Or at least my parents say that. And probably there are many other people, who share that idea of theirs.
Even poor people save their last money and send their child to a University, dooming themselves on misery. They hope their child's life will be better than that they lead. It is true, that the Bulgarians have never made savings from education. Moreover, in the times of the Ottoman influence, when their life was incredibly hard, they sent their sons either to Bukurest or to Moscow to study. Knowledge and education are among the values, which the Bulgarians keep so jealously.
Nowadays some things have changed. We study, winged by the idea of the bright future, which is in store for us. Sometimes I ask myself what I shall do, after I get my diploma. Shall I dive into the deep water of business? With my only ambition to succeed? Will I be able?
Little by little you realize that life is not only scales, figures, letters and theoretical grammar. It is something abstract and complex, where everything is connected and interchangeable. Unfortunately, you can not realize it while at the University, but too late - when you have already entered the real world. And you must act as good as you can - the rivalry is merciless. What you have learned in a University will not help everytime and to succeed, you must involve your ambition, senses and wit. The most precious is the fact, that you solve the problems yourself.
Some philosophers share the idea, that you are your own self, after you graduate from University and enter the real life. Since at the University you are taught how to study and what to do, you are not yourself. You are put in a kind of frame, where you should be just a student. Yes, it sounds vulgar, but it is - you are nothing, but a faculty number!
In three years I will be getting my diploma M.A. degree! How it sounds only! Master of Arts! Brilliant! Even thrilling! But will I manage to work and to get on with all those people? I doubt, since I lack experience! I am not sure, that in the beginning I will be able to use everything I have learned at the University and apply it, so that I could get the best of it.
Actually, I don't think, that lacking experience is a fault of any University. Even more - the University does its best to prepare us for the life and to make us skilled specialists. But in many cases it confesses its own incompetemce. The problem (if there is such) is that here at the University, we live in an artificial world. Everything is arranged and prepared for us and we engulf the knowledge at big goes. At the same time we are attached from the outer world, where exept for intelligence, honesty and friendship, there is misery, starvation and crimes.
Of course, I do agree with those who say that University is a miniature of the whole world.
But I dare say - only the best part of it. The things we do improve our talents and ideas, but we never run into things, we do in the real world. The real world teaches you things, you have never dreamed of. Even my grandmother often says ""life will teach you things, that no one else will teach you!"" And she is right. Experience shows you how to cope with different situations and to make the most of them. On the other hand the University diploma is of a great value - you use what you have studied and apply your knowledge to that particular situation, when deep knowledge and understanding of the matter is needed.
After all, I do not think that my University diploma will be of a very little value. On the contrary - it is a kind of warrant for my qualities as a specialist. Without these things, I am learning here, I won't be able to work and to be useful both for my family and my country. Experience can be obtained in the process of working. And I am thankful to Sofia University ""St. Kliment Ochridsky"" for everything it does for its students.

The Industrial Revolution - the initial stage of the scientific and technological revolution of the 20th century - has had both positive and negative consequences upon the human mind. On the one hand it made people believe in the rational capacity of the human brain which led to the idea of progress and brought about a number of inventions of vital importance. But on the other hand it established a mechanistic view of nature, the universe and the human body itself. In this way the Industrial revolution led to a preoccupation with material philosophy which aimed at using your mental energy for rational thinking rather than dreaming.
Dreaming and imagination, however, the two words that characterizsed the poems of the Romantics, have never been and cannot be replaced by science, technology and industrialization. The reasons for this are that though science and imagination are two entirely different things, they are not incompatible i.e the presence of the one does not exclude the presence of the other. Furthermore, the situation nowadays shows that most people cannot do without either of them. On the other hand history proved and the present is still proving that the sensitive non-mechanical minds, which definitely put a boundary between the two, react more sharply and become more creative when they feel threatened by the presence of industrialization.
The forms of their rebels find numerous expressions leaving us with some of the most valuable pieces of literature and art.
If we read the poems of the romantics - the first to rebel against the cult to rationalism and define such terms as ""fancy"" and ""imagination"", we will discover a great poetry of feelings in which even the illusiveness of a dream can spur the imagination to create.
Later on when urbanization and industrialization have already become serious problems of the 20th century society writers such as D. H. Laurence and V. Wolf adopt as a central theme the threatening quality of an industrial society and create powerful images and charachters. Like the Romantics, who driven by the force of imagination, write the most beautiful poetry, ""a spontaneous overflow of powerful feelings"", these artists and their followers try to go beyong reality and what they consider the limited and the limiting lucidities of consciousness. Moreover they urge the reader to imagine giving an open-end to their novels.
Nowadays in a world dominated by science and technology it is only natural that dreaming and imagination will be for most people the way out of the restrictiveness of the industrial framework of mind. There are people too whose imagination is inspired by science. The result is the availability of science fiction.
Therefore no matter which way round one will think of science and imagination as two opposite or two closely related things - the outcome of a society dominated by technology is imaginative insperation and search after dreaming.

A university is an institution of higher learning, a place to obtain a general knowledge base as well as specific knowledge on the subject you have chosen to study. If the point of university education was merely to expose the students to a variety of subjects and then provide them with a university degree, then I might agree that the degrees obtained in the end are only theoretical and do not prepare students for the real world. After all people can be exposed to subjects by watching TV and reading magazines. The purpose of going to university, however, is to get knowledge which will be not only applicable but also absolutely necessary for your further work in the respective area.
One example of university knowledge which will be practically applied later is my own field - English and American Studies. It will be hardly possible for someone who had not attended all these seminars in phonology, morphology, syntax, British and American culture and English- Bulgarian translation to be well acquainted with the language and culture of these countries and to become a good teacher, translator or interpreter later. On the other hand students in this field learn enough to become critical thinkers in various disciplines. It means that they get enough understanding of certain issues to be able to discuss them intelligently and to be able to question other people's view rather than accept what people tell them. In university one learns to think critically, to approach problems logically, to use reasoning.
Another example for university courses, which find a direct practical application in life later is the case with students of science. Certainly one cannot become a doctor, a dentist or a chemist without a certain amount of knowledge which only university can provide. The argument on the value of university degrees is therefore pointless with the students of science. In addition to providing us with the absolutely necessary knowledge for our future profession, university education is vital for us in our highly technological society. Every day we are confronting with issues concerning nuclear waste, chemical pollutions, medical advances, innovations in technology, and so forth. In order to make intelligent decisions - in fact even to be involved in decision-making processes, people must have an understanding of these issues which goes beyond a mere exposure to a variety of courses and getting a university degree of little value.
Otherwise, we may become mere pupets, who, out of ignorance can only nod in agreement with anyone who provides a suitable argument on a topic. Our history is full of politicians and charlatanes who, not having the necessary knowledge and capacity for making decisions, have taken the responsability of being leading figures in the development of society.
University courses then provide us not only with knowledge that is crucial for the areas we have chosen to develop, but they also provide us with the opportunity to improve our critical reasoning skills. Therefore though these courses are difficult, they are worth the effort, because the knowledge and thinking skills gained from them will help us in all areas of life and will make us evaluate more intelligently and critically the propositions offered to us.

To many people university degrees are apperently quite valuable. Not few parents hang over the heads of their offspring to keep their nose to the grindstone of diligent studying in order to get them into a university. They spend energy on control and exhortation and when their sons and daughters have been admitted to the desired institution they do not stint the means for their maintenance. To get to such lengths, such parents must share the opinion of university education being a fit preparation for the real world. Seeing things this way, though, means assuming that the young man about to aspire for a degree in his role of student, is somewhere outside the real world, not yet launched into the sea of real life. Accordingly, his occupation is thought of as preliminatory to the occupation belonging to the real world proper. To put things simply, learning, exploring the realms of theory is considered a prelude to doing. From that point of view, university education is highly recommendable if it qualifies one to do things, that is, work as engineer, doctor, lawyer, etc. A profession is the primary means of establishing a person well into the domain of real world. Through entering a profession one secures a place, a function and, therefore, consequence in the social fabric. At a more real, i.e. material level, one is significantly enabled to possess and use tangible objects necessary for bodily survival, security and pleasure.
In short, a profession grants all that money can buy in amounts proportionate to income.
Usually, university degrees are indispensable for many of the most influential, prestigious and lucrative professions in the civilized world. It could be aptly argued that throughout his actual practice a lawyer, for instance, may never fall back upon some of the legal principles he has been obliged to learn during his studies. The reverse is equally possible: his work may involve situations he was never explicitly instruced about at the university. Both these cases, however, little prove the existence of a vast gulf between education and profession. Obviously, it would be odd to demand perfect overlapping of two different activities and discrepancies of the mentioned kind should be expected as a matter of course. Even if the relation between education and profession is better qualified by a subtler term - qualification instead of preparation - to deny its value is pointless. Indeed, parents who advise their children to study make a good investment.
To explore a different perspective, mention should be made of people more willing to free theory of its servitude to the real world of confirmed facts. They create parallel ideal worlds often called upon to reshape and improve the one until then held to be unalterably real. To them a university degree is surely valuable for its very being theoretical.

A man is sitting on a bench in the park in the prime of spring. A busy thoroughfare that plunges right into the heart of the city is about a hundred metres distant from him. It supplies a fairy audible background of a steady drone. The sky is suffused with travelling clouds slowly mutating as they pass. The young, bright green leaves give off a mild radiance as they swallow the sunbeams of late morning. The skyline is made up of multi-coloured tree-tops. The man's feet rest on an asphalt alley populated by buzzing bicycles and wandering dogs pestered by their owners.
He is trying to dream, to loosen the reins of his imagination and let it prance at leisure. He is slightly displeased to find out that his mind has to be urged to fly with the floating clouds and follow their protean shapes. Worse still, it is somehow restless, ready to switch incessantly from one object to another, at random. A mind has its habits just as the man himself has his. What it is used to in the majority of modern people in the course of mundane employments is a constant shifting of thoughts and images. It responds to the spectacle the big city offers - a wearing flow of all conceivable colours, yet a strangely monotonous flow; vehicles and people of endless variety, perversely leaving behind an impression of uniformity. In the merciless flood of stimuli the mind is trained to a sterile unfixity. The man in the park has barely succeeded in perceiving a creeping crab in a cloud that takes up the sky in front when a cyclist claims his attention. The eyes passively let themselves be carried away by the exqusite machine. The creative effort is superseded by mere registering - just another well-built bike. The imagination has little to do here, nothing to improve or alter. It has been dampened by a sort of rudimentary scientific knowledge: flashing recognitions of how a bike is constructed, out of what materials, what measurements are taken. Anyway, the flight of imagination fails, nipped in the bud of lack of a steady mind to carry it out on its wings.
Happily, the man on the bench is sometimes capable of sustained mental effort. He is now vexed, however, by his mind's stubborn fruitlesness. He is unable to see the cloud as a crab on the ocean floor because he can plainly realise it is only a body of air. So he knows from a faint recollection of a lesson in physics (or geography), so he is told by the authoritative weather forecast. It seems the man is too much out of his depth when he courts imagination, he is much more at home with knowledge. He can steadily lean on it or expand it by small, calculated, predictable steps, as prescribed by scientific method.
Still, it would be gross ingratitude if the man should say he had no place for dreaming.
The sky above the bench is a canavas for numberless paintings and the twittering birds tell endless stories. If he could only shut out the encroaching world of things compyling with a well- masured scheme...

There is no doubt in the fact that we live under the full reign of science, technology and industrialization. Our lives are dominated by them in every aspect. The whole world looks like an enormous machine working at enormous speed and the parts that constitute this machine are the people themselves. A machine, as you know, is not capable of feeling, dreaming or imagining because it is alive. The same holds for its parts. In other words, what I am trying to say more figuratively is that in our world of science, technology and industrialization there is no really place for dreaming and imagination.
One of the reasons for the disappearing of the dreams and the imagination from our life is one that I really regret to mention, that is the lack of time. We are really pressed for time nowadays. We are so busy nowadays, we have so many work to do that every wasted minute can be fatal for us. Our minds are completely engaged with practical matters and problems for solving. Even when we have a little free time we cannot relax and sink into the beautiful world of the dreams and the imagination. We worry about the future, we arrange our plans for the next day. We live under a constant stress which undermines not only our health but also the emotional part of our human nature. You can ask someone if he dreams about something. The answer you are most likely to get is: 'Dreams are a waste of time. I have much more important things to do now than sitting and thinking about something which would never happen!' The civilized man becomes similar to a robot with his planned live and lack of inner imaginative world.
In connection with what I said above I would like to share my own experince. I am a student at Sofia University. I live under a constant stress because I have to study for difficult exams all the time as well as attending lectures and seminars every day. When I was a child I used to read a lot of fiction and I had a vivid imagination which influenced by the books, created new strange situations and events in which I was the main chasiaracter. I used to dream of becoming a seawoman and visit all the exotic places in the world. Now the dreams are no longer part of my life. I live only with worries and fears now. The dull routine of my day little by little ruins my fragile inner world. I have no free time to devote to dreaming. Whenever I have some time to waste I rest by watching television, playing sports or meeting friends. The practical side of my nature dominates rather than the imaginative one.
As a conclusion I would point out the sad truth - our world has progressed to such an extent that we cannot do without science and technology and industrialisation. We may realize that they destroy something of our human nature, that they make us turn into mechanically- thinking creatures but we cannot prevent this process from advancing. The only consolation that remains for us is that we have experienced the beauty of dreaming and imagining in our childhood which is still a preserved area not influenced by the characteristic phenomena of our century.

It is a commonly shared belief among a lot of people, or at least those who are more practically-minded that most university degrees provide you only with 'theory which cannot be put into practice' and therefore we can do without them. They separate the two terms 'theory' and 'practice' and contrast them as two things that cannot work together. Here they make a big mistake because these two complement each other and have a very strong connection.
Therefore, to say that the university degrees are unimportant because they do not prepare students for the real world is absurd and far from the truth.
First, I want to give support to my statement judging from my own experience as a student at Sofia University. I study at the Depertment of English and American Studies there and the degree I shall get in three years' time will give me the right to work as a teacher or a translator in English. At the moment I teach two friends of mine English and I can say without exaggerating at all that I have no problems with practising the profession of a teacher. My theoretical courses at University help me to see this language in works in all its aspects and what kind of difficulties the Bulgarian learner of English is likely to face. In this way I put a greater emphasis on the problematic zones for my students and the resuls are really satisfying. Before entering Sofia University I knew the language good enough to teach but so many things were unclear and peculiar to me that I found the English a bit illogical. Now I know a lot and I am more confident than ever that I shall have no problems with the practising of my chosen profession.
In support of my belief that the university degrees are not important, but on the contrary very useful, I could say one of the requirements for work nowadays is to have a university degree allowing you to practise the desired profession. In our country you cannot hope to work as an accountant, engeneer, doctor or whatever it is without having diploma for higher education. There are, of course, jobs not requiring any special qualification but they are badly paid and dull. So even you have the lowest university degree, you have the chance to work what you want. The higher education is the key to progress and success in life. This is realized by most people and that is why there is considerable increase of young people applying for universities every year.
Now that I expressed my opinion about the importance of the university degrees I can say in conclusion that I know many people, young and not so young, who think like me. You do not have to have the highest university degree in order to succeed in something. But you will certainly feel more confident, respected by people and your position in society or at work will be much better than that of people having no university degree.

Most university degrees are really rather theoretically oriented and do not prepare students for the real world. And yet you cannot easily wave away and say that they are of very little value.
In principle, there is no practise without theory. But both things should be balanced, I think. Of course, the nature of the subjects should be taken into account because there are subjects that need much more theoretical background then others.
There are some subjects that need a solid theoretical preparation. Let's take, for example, literary sciences. Each one of them is a vast field but when it comes to applying your knowledge to a given piece of literary work the things become even more difficult. You can tell what feelings the work inspires in you, what images and associations it evokes but you cannot go deep in the language and the style of the author. In this case, practise is impossible without having a theoretical background.
There are, however, other subjects that require much more practical knowledge than it is provided in the curriculum. Most economic subjects are such ones. Let's take, for example, socio- economic planning. Many of the students who have studied this subject after leaving university would like to become dealers. The subject is quite appropriate for this job but it turns out that higher mathematics, book-keeping and all the other numerous subjects which are thaught at the university cannot help you cope with the work. You have to go through different practical courses in order to learn to work with Reuters terminals, fax and telex machines. You enter a complitely stange world; a world you have seen only on the screen. Of course, the economic terminology would help you but not a lot. And it is then that you start doubting your university degree.
You start asking several questions about your study and the educational system as a whole. You wonder why you have studied so many years and now you have to start from the beginning. You cannot answer the question why you have learned by heart thousand formulas and definitions but not learned some elementary practical operations.
According to me, we learn too much theoretical things at the university and when we leave it we are not prepared for the real world. But the degrees we receive are not in any respect of little value. They could be of a greater value if the educational system could be changed a little, but this does not mean they are of little value now. Because everything we have learned may be of some use some day. And the numerous subjects we study give us rich general knowledge.

Today when we are at the threshold of a new millenium more and more people would like to meet it if not with a higher-education diploma in their hands at least studying at some famous university. However, here comes the question to what an extent can all these university degrees prepare students for their future life and aren't they more theoretical than practical? It is difficult to answer these questions with one word only.
It is true that until recently most university degrees were mainly theoretical and still a large number of them have not changed for the better. What they aim at is to prepare students theoretically on the subject they have chosen, to make them learn things which, besides being explained in a very difficult scientific way, turn out to be useless and impractical. On the other hand, students should have, of course, some theoretical background knowledge but also they should know how to use and apply it. Otherwise, all the efforts will be in vain. The programme should be constructed in such a way that it should take the best from both theory and practice.
For example, last year my colleagues and I, who study English philology, had to go through a course in information technology. As a whole, this is a new and interesting field which can be of great help to us in our future work as philolgists. However, this course was mainly theoretical which turned out to be an impediment for us. Instead of being given the chance to learn how to use a computer in practice, we had to try and learn by heart the parts of the computer and many other dtails which we could hardly understand and which were for us like the words of an unknown language.
Some other courses are also theoretical and even the lecturers themselves cannot come to an agreement whether or not to try and make them more practical. The best way of solving this ticklish question is choosing a programme in between. Thus, students will be theoretically prepared and they will know how exactly to use the knowledge acquired. This has been understood by most of the lecturers in our department and they have been working very hard for the last three years to make the courses we take more practically-oriented. This is the purpose of first and second year students' presentations. This is very useful because in this way those students who have chosen to become teachers can feel what it is like and one day they will not feel out of place when having to stand in front of a class for the first class.
So, if students of English philology are lucky to acquire both theoretical and practical knowledge, this is not the case with most of their colleagues from the department of law. As far as students of law in our country are concerned it can be said that their degrees are, on the one hand, of very little value. This is particulary true about the preparation of students at certain depertments in the country. Most of these departments are not properly equipped for the practical training of students. For example, it is very important for the future lawyers to have at their disposal a special training courtroom with the help of which they could learn how to express themselves on legal questions in a loud voice, how to communicate with each other using the specific terminology to solve legal debates like true lawyers. This would make things easier for them when practising their profession. Another important thing which is, unfortunately, not available at all universities is aspecial kind of cinema hall. Such a hall is very useful for the students in a number of disciplines which cannot be explained with the help of photos in textbooks only. Students need to get a precise picture of reality. When studying in details the different types of crimes, it is necessary that they are shown documentary films. Besides, students of law should be allowed to courtrooms and prosecutor's offices. It turns out that students of law have an excellent preparation in theory but they lack practice.
The case is different for students of medicine. They are able to practise immediately what they have learned in theory and it should be like that since their profession is vital. Of course, it is a little bit different from their real work because students can be corrected by their lecturers if they make and mistakes. However, the opportunity they have to see how what they learn in textbooks works in real life is great.
Although our education is on a very high level and we study a lot of difficult subjects, we still fall behind the other countries in which people have understood earlier that theory without practice counts for nothing. What is the use of studying hard for five years and then, when it comes to showing what one knows, it turns out to be an impossible task.
It is very encouraging that some universities in our country have set out to introduce new programmes which rely on practical realization of the theory studied and it would be really useful if all the rest follow them. Thus, university degrees will not be theoretical but they will prepare students for the real world and they will be satisfied with what they will have learned.

The major objective of each university is to deliver high-quality educational programs, and to prepare its students for successful careers in the ever-changing world of today. But it is common knowledge that there is an increasing number of graduates who cannot find work simply because the sciences they have read at university, the different majors they get, and the degrees and qualifications they obtain, are no longer relevant and are of little importance to the needs of the employment market.
That is why such people are often forced by adverse economic odds to re-train themselves or reconcile with some second-rate occupation. But it is too unpleasant, humiliating even, to find out that the things one has learnt with so much assiduity, and which have cost him or her so many sleepless nights, are useless and valueless. Though in university catalogues, each academic program is presented in a most interesting and attrective light, and holds promises to ensure excellent academic training and profound knowledge acquisition, as well as a wide scope of professional opportunities, this hardly corresponds to those facts of reality students are bound to meet with afterwards. Right and justified as catalogue information may be, there is no denying the sad fact of the existence of enless failures in the field of professional fulfilment after graduation. Some programs are, no doubt, quite theoretical and provide students with knowledge which is too abstract and irrelevant to the real needs of siciety. It is a great disappointment for one of high education and accomplishment not to have the chance to apply his or her knowledge in some professional area.
Most people find a way to adapt themselves and even to build succesful careers with the help of that university acquired knowledge. The sad fact is that not everyone is psychologically so stable, so pushing or self-promoting as to be able to make the best use of those little practical abilities he or she has adopted in his or her development up to graduation. Most young university graduates do not succeed in implementing their knowledge in practice and are, in the long-run, written off as professional failures.
What a good university curriculum should try hard to keep up with is the demand of the market, be it in the sphere of mental or manual qualifications. University courses should be constantly updated so as not to become obsolete and thus they would easily avoid the risk of teaching things no one actually needs.
The present disastrous disparity of interests, the unfortunate incompatability of university degrees and real demands should be abolished as soon and as effectively as possible, because otherwise most educational institutions would not be able to stand up to the test of time.

It is true that the 20th century is the time of machines and industrial development and that all sorts of technological achievements surround us in our everyday life, but that does not lead to the conclusion that dreams and imagination are no longer a part of it! It seems to me that they are not just a part of it, but a very meaningful one at that, because they are the two things that make the world go on and are taking it further and further in its development to excellence.
Various kinds of machinery and technical devices are effectively, invariably present in our life but they, in most cases, are nothing but commodities, produced to facilitate it, not to constitute it. Dreams and machines are not mutually exclusive, since they are not in inverse ratio: Imagination belongs to an individual's mind. One is either born with it or else does not have it. It can not be acquired, it's innate.
It is a fact that many people have used their imagination for technical purposes,for scientific inventions and improvements, for technological and industrial advance, and have had, if I can so call them, 'technical' dreams, but this does not mean that our whole life is teeming with such ideas only, or that one dreams of nothing else. The sight of a beautiful lake or a sunset has always given vent to one's imagination and still does. The dreams of today are quite different and much more pragmatic than the dreams of the past but they still make people wish for thousands of different things and make them happy at least for a while.
But nowadays most people rarely have time for such moments. Their days are so full of endless tasks and obligations they have to accomplish, that they sometimes hardly have the time to eat, let alone to dream. Some people would say that such a life in which there is no time for dreams and imagination is dreadfully tedious and they would probably be right; but let's not forget that to work hard and to be perseverant in one's efforts to earn enough money and to buy the latest of the scientific and technological achievements - a computer, a car or a TV set - all this is also a kind of fulfilment of a dream - the dream of a better life. And even though this dream is too down-to-eatrh and too apparently utilitarian, yet it is indispensable. Everyone tries to find his or her proper place in the world as well as to build their life in a comfortable and peaceful way and then, when all this is accomplished, most people hope to have enough time at their disposal for dreaming.
Some people succeed in finding the adequate proportion between dreams and reality, others never do; some always find a few leisurely minutes for dreaming regardless of the difficulties of their days, others spend their whole life dreaming of inconsequential things. But I think, it is of little importance how one spends one's life, whether one dreams or not, whether one has imagination or not, as long as one is happy. For happiness is, in my opinion, the most important thing in human life and it is consequently the only aim that is worth pursuing and devoting oneself to.

I'd rather agree with this statement although it is not the case in some universities. But since here it is referred to ""some"" university degrees, I'm rather willing to express my agreement on the fact. Our daily experience shows that many universities in Bulgaria prepare a lot of students compared to the total population in our country. So, these universities are interested in attracting many students and their education in them is more theoretical than practical. On receiving their degrees, students realise they are not qualified enough for their relevant jobs because they lack the proper practice. Such degrees are useful only if the student wants to work for the same university and teach the same theoretical subjects or they can become scholars on the basis of their theoretical knowledge. But on the whole, students with such degrees will be less practically skilful than students from other universities who have had more practical courses. Here is the place to say that therefore these theoretical degrees are of little value for the students because they will not be competible in the real world. I will give an example with two Bulgarian universities - the Technical university and the Mathematical faculty of Sofia university. In the latter, students which study information science have a lot of mathematical and physical courses instead of concentrating on making software programs which is their special province. On the other hand the students of the Technical university wich study compuer science are more skilful because of their practical courses. And when the software specialists of Sofia university enter into this stage of their lifes when they have to show their skills, they won't have enough experience with computers compared to the computer engineers of the Technical university. So perhaps a graduate of Sofia university will ask himself - ""what am I going to do with my degree, how can I find a job when I cannot write a simple program because all these years I studied mathematics.
And in this way he will understand that his diploma is of little value. What he lacks is experience in programing and he realises all these years have been a waste of time because he will be less skilful than a computer engineer from another university.
On the whole, it is true that our university degrees in most cases are theoretical and in our country the situation is more difficult because young people cannot find their relevant jobs which makes it even worse. Although some degrees are of little value, they sometimes can be useful - it depends on how lucky you are.

In the first place here I would like to point out that probably these ""some people"" ignore something very important - that the world is changing rapidly but people stay the same in terms of their feelings and habits. People always dream and let loose their imagination no matter how industrialized our world have become. This development of science, technology and industry is inevitable because man is incessantly inventing and this inventing is a consequence of man's imagination and wits. It is true that science and hi-tech products have made people more down- to-earth but they cannot confine man - we can still go to a place of green grass, with trees occupied by flocks of birds and air rich of fragrance - and lie on the green grass dreaming up beautiful stories and events. That is still possible in our mechanised world of cars, labour-saving machines, computers, etc. The point I make is that people are still the same, only the world is changing in accordance with their increasing demands. However it is true that some people are so absorbed by their work, that coming home totally exhausted, they just lie in bed and go to sleep immediately. Such people have become a part of the technologies. They have wiped off their faces all traces of personal feelings - they lack emotions, let alone dreaming; they are intersted only in work, money and power. Back to the statement above, I must say I totally disagree with it perhaps because I am an optimist. I believe that people still have inside them all those wonderful purely human feelings - like dreaming. Imagination has always been a specific feature of human brain. Unlike animals we people are endowed with a brain capable of imagining, inventing and dreaming. These features are a part of our human nature. These feelings are immortal just as our souls. Our spiritual continuum is free, it cannot be locked within the confinement of industrial development and technological bloom. Our souls adapt to the new technological world. They get used to it but it doesn't necessarily mean that they are not already free and no longer romantic. On the contrary, people feel the necessity to dream and exploit their imagination exactly because of the vast industrialisation. People feel this necessity more than ever because in such a world we realise the need of it. Some people may realise it, some may not, but dreaming and imagination are a part of everyday life as are sleeping, yawning, smiling , laughing. The latter cannot become extinct because they are our human nature, such is the case with dreaming and imagination. They cannot be torn from our nature, they cannot be destroyed.
So I find the above statement that there is no place for such feelings in our world not according to my views. I strongly believe that along with the technological development, the need to dream and imagine will increase or else we are not humans any more.

I can say I disagree with the above-mentioned statement. The modern world is indeed very much under the domination of science, technology and industrialization which take a great part of our free time and play an important role in our lives. But I do not think that people have forgotten their dreams and left aside their imagination as useless. The mere fact that they still fall in love, raise families and create chefs-d'oevre of art, signifies that the world does not completely lack its essence - imagination.
As I mentioned, I agree that the modern world is obsessed with science, technology, industry and their derivatives. They take up a great deal of people's lives and rob them of their free time. Nowadays people prefer to watch TV, play video games or sit in front of the computer for hours, instead of gathering with other people, reading books or just lying in bed by themselves, thinking. But nonetheless, every activity one is occupied with brings about some thoughts. When a person watches a film, he/she imagines what it would be like of he/she were the main character, for example.
Another thing which I would like to mention is that the modern person often feels burdened and unhappy with his daily life and when he/she returns home in the evening and goes to bed, there is nothing more relieving than dreaming - how good things would have been if he/she had done them in a different way. Dreaming is the only real escape from the nuisance of the routine life.
People still fall in love and buy flowers to their lovers, or take them to the theatre or a rastaurant and so on. They also marry and raise children, take care of them and love them. And dreaming and imagination are an essential part of love and romance. If they did not exist, love and romance would be reduced to mere reproductive and survival instincts, which is not the case definitely.
Art is another thing that requires imagination. Even though art does not flourish and is not the same today as it was in previous centuries. I believe that every kind of music, painting literature or film is inspired by imagination.
As a conclusion, I will say that the world may be overwhelmed by technology and information which deprive us of our free time, but I believe that there still is a place for dreaming and imagination. Evidence for that is the existence of love between people, and also the arts - two things that absolutely require imagination.

To my mind, education has always been a great dilemma, the two sides of it being whether students, especially in school, should be taught everything, so that they can develop their general knowledge and be good in nothing particular, or whether they should specialize in a certain field and be fully competent in it, but not be able to use a screwdriver, so to say. The problem with university education is very much the same, only the range of different subjects is narrowed to a number of them circling around that student's major. University students, too, study useless subjects that would never help them in life.
Higher education, of course, is meant to give young people a degree which testifies their knowledge in a certain field. But I do not think that degrees are so important. Whether a person is a Bachelor or a Master or a Doctor does not matter. Everything depends on his/her individual skills, inclinations and inborn faculties. Someone can study hard for years and become a Doctor in one field, but if he/she has not learned how to express himself/herself then he/she is no better than someone who is a Master in the same field but has very good explanatory skills. And what is more, I think, university degrees nowadays show more prestige than knowledge, and people strive towards them for the sake of the prestige rather than for the sake of knowledge. And that is quite snobbish!
Education as a whole, of course, cannot prepare students for what are maybe essential parts of life - love disappointments, family life, life with others, self-confidence and so on. But, nevertheless, it plays an important role in one's life. It teaches us group and individual work, seriousness and consistency, and most of all - students obtain knowledge and become specialists in different fields, which later helps them to find a job. And job, as we know, is an essential part of people's lives, because having a job is a sure way of making money. If I am to speak in more narrow terms, that is, about Bulgaria, I can say that here, education does not guarantee a job, or at least a well-paid one. The really rich people here are, to a certain extent, badly educated. But, anyway, education remains the most respectable way of earning one's living.
To sum it up, I will say that in my opinion, university degrees have little value because they do not guarantee a person's intellect. While education, on the other hand, is useful in many ways, mainly because it gives us knowledge on a certain subject which helps us find a job later.

A lot of people consider that having a university degree is one of the most important tasks a man should fulfil. Whether having a university degree is that necessary is quite a controversal issue. The question is how it can help people to provide themselves and their families with a better and happier life.
To some extent our education and respectively getting a degree has an essential role in our life. In a way it may predetermine our position in the society not only in the sense of being rich and having a good career. It is important of our self-esteem and the respect and attitude we receive from the people around us.
But in my opinion the university degree has little to do with our preparation for the Life. It can give you a chance to live a life of full value, to be informed, to be adequate to the world around. At the same time it can make you feel distant from the every-day life. We all know people who, although they have not just one but two and more degrees, cannot deal with very simple things. And life itself is in fact a chain of many simple things. These people get panic-stricken from things and situations which other people, without having any degree take as a ""piece of cake"". We often call them ""the absent-minded professor"", but the truth is that they rarely feel comfortably among people, they can hardly get interested in any other activity except studying and getting more qualified. I am not sure whether my will be adequate but I had a school-mate who was always very well-prepared for classes, he always knew much more than the teachers wanted us to know. And at the same time he was unable to talk with anyone of us, he never visited our parties, never shared his feelings or opinions with us. As far as I know, now he studies abroad, and he will get a degree, but I am not sure if he will be able to experience the number of pleasures life offers us. There are a lot of people that are famous scientists, or have achieved a lot in their profession, but at the same time they are unsociable and are lonely; usually at the ""age of sixty when they find themselves ""presented a watch"" they often get the feeling that they have missed the best moments in the life.
The university degree can give a better start in life but cannot prepare for the life itself, because it is not a kind of existential knowledge. If, for instance, someone has graduated in chemistry, they can know a lot about that complicated science, but it does not mean that they are prepared for the problems in life. The university degree can make you more assured, because when one is well educated they can find a better job; and even is something happens and they are left jobless, they will have a chance to find a good job. Of cource, that does not refer to our country where things seem to be just the opposite - the more educated you are the more probably you will not find a job. In Bulgaria where doctors drive taxies, university degrees are less and less useful.
To some extent, there is a relation between the University degree and the preparation for life, but it is not in the degree itself. While we are students we become more self-controlling. We get more disciplined, because we have tasks to fulfil in a strict dedline. It is not as in schools, where teachers are always checking their students. At the university we become more self- dependent. We wtudy in groups and at the same time we rely only on ourselves. There is a kind of a competition which makes us more ambitious persons and it is a sort of preparation for the big competition - life. Studying at university is very prestigious, so one should keep fit in order to be able to graduate. We learn to overcome obstacles - every exam we have to pass is in a way preparation for the many difficult situations we will meet in life and will have to cope with. When we become students, even our parents more or less change their attitude - they take us as grown-up children who do not need their constant cares.
That is why in my opinion it is very difficult to give a straight answer. It has its advantages, but on the whole I do not think that having a university degree is that much important.

Studying is a serious step forward into one's future life and preparation for her, or his life.
Studying is a non-exhaustive term. Studying is everybody's chance for development and growth.
Though sometimes students are faced to the problems of studying which are not unessential at all.
A graduate from a famous University could be put in an embarrassing situation on the street with a diploma in his hand. Because all graduates are theoretically prepared for real life but practically are unable to cope with the major problems that appear in reality.
They usually live a two-dimensional life. From one side is the simple matter of theory and studied advices and learned situations while just on the other side of the coin they face real world with its different variants on living and surviving.
We can never find the solution of our problems in the thick books and heavily-loaded text- books. There are always moments when we stay in front of the mirror and ask ourselves: ""What shall I do now? I cannot find the answer in either book"".
What matters in real life is thinking. Graduates are always challenged to making deep observations and taking out the most essential advices.
What really happens is the fact that graduates who have passed with flying honours some respectable schools are absolutely unable to manage their practical matters. They cannot use their minds because they are ""loaded to the brim with facts"" - a famous quotation from Charles Dickens's novel.
Graduates are used to learning and remembering but not exactly to deep understanding and putting into practice. Imaginery thinking and new ideas are welcomed in our modern century where only innovations are surviving and those who introduce them are able to give life a new meaning.
Those living by the help of the books are offered few models to follow strictly.
Each graduate is acquainted as well with languages, maths, history, poetry, biology and geography as with sports, arts and crafts, chemistry or grammar.
Where are the lessons on ""preparing for life""? Where are the practical adivces and seminars? No need for them in Universities because these institutions are invented to be theoretical.
But still they give good education and personal satisfaction to many students. Education will continue existing for centures on end. Each graduate will show his or her degree with joy and happiness. The moment of graduation will stay in the graduate's hearth till the last puff of breath leaves his body. There exists a certain amount of innocence and genuity in these never-forgotten- moments in your life. When you are free to say your opinion and ready to accept other's opinions.
I do not disapprove of graduates and I am far away from doing it because I myself will soon be one.
My personal and humble opinion on graduate degrees is inspired by my own observation and only private conseptions that I have had the chance to live through in the Sofia University ""Kliment Ohridski"".
We live in society pretending to accept differences, peculiarities and features of manner and education.
As a free-thinking second-year student I would love to say that studying is a positive aspect as well as a negative one considering preparing you for real life. The individuals should consider the result according their own perceptions.
I love studying and I shall continue doing it.

We are happy to live in a time when high technology dominates our existence. Human- beings are simply advised to follow progress and development in order to keep up with their routine duties and obligations. High technology and future progress mark humans' lives, jobs, schedules and even thiking.
Machines are introduced all over the world and they replace people's duties. Robots, vacuum cleaners, refrigirators, computers atc. enable you to have some more spare time for yourself but they actually deprive you of being the one who you really are. What I mean when saying this is simple.
Man is deprived of his own personality and acts with the use of the machines.
Computers check your essays, week assignements, incomes paid and unpaid taxes, monthly fees and so on. Your car takes you to whichever part of the country you want to go to.
The TV - introduces you the newest products that have just been invented. Big precincts take most of your time and amuse you all day-and-night long.
People appear to be dictated what to do with their time by machines and robots. These metally-designed creatures are the dominant figures nowadays.
What has happened to the innocence of Nature when you have been free to enjoy every single minute just by staring out of the window at a tree full of fruits. What has happened to your personal untouched choice of goods when you go to the shop, sauntering among the counters and choosing those things that you really need. Not these products that you are advised by the media to buy.
You are unable to dream of purchases eventhough you give your own salaries for them.
You pay high sums for modern appliances in order to be up-to-date. You can read books while staying at home in front of the computer serching into the numberless pages issued into your web pages in the INTERNET. You can order goods from home and be carried pizza to your door.
No longer have we time for dreaming and imagination about things that we don't really have. Because we have already had everything that we have dreamt of. ""Metal mental weapons"" act instead of us. Industrialisation is developing with seconds. Technology and prosper coincide, science dominate.
""What a lovely world we have constructed!"" - says one.
But even a child should notice the verb ""constructed"" that is used quite properly. Because we have created a world in which there is no longer a place for imagination. There is no some extra time spent on dreaming and deep thoughts.
We live a scheduled-life in which only fixed deeds and appointments are valid.
It is really a pity to live like a machine.
I want to be human, first! You can hear this statement all around you - in the bus, in the hairdresser's, in the butcher's etc. But do you really think that it bears some meaning.
It is lacked of meaning and observation. Its main task is to force you into thinking but there is no a real result.
Persons are used to living in that way and they won't dare destroy it at whatever cost it might be. If you stick to the programme and don't feed your mind with thinking you would be a perfect human. It is your choice whether to accept this idea or not. I have accepted it just to be fashionable.

Education all over the world is different so it is hard to talk about university degrees in general. However studying in an university has some similar aspects no matter where you are doing it - you are given a certain amount of information, told where to find more information and hopefully taught how to use all this information.
So information is what we strive for and there are two ways to gather it. One is to read and to listen, in other words to get to know the matter on the theoretical level. The other is by experience.
Some people think that only experience can prepare you for the things you will have to do in the real world. Maybe they are right.
What they seem to forget is that most of the things we will have to do require both the theory and the experience. You can become a great musician just with practising and even without learning to read music. But you can't build a skyscraper only with practising - you will have to go through a sea of theory or otherwise you will be responsible for the concrete debris injuring people all over the town. And a surgeon can perform a brain surgery only if he has read a hell of a lot of medicine books but on the other hand if he had only read and never before operated in his life I wouldn't give the patient any chances of survival.
It is interesting that while searching for this examples I couldn't think of even one job you can do really well without any practice. Maybe that is why the question of the value of university degrees has risen. Nevertheless for me this is rather an absurd question. It is obvious that theory and experience are thoroughly entangled in our so called real world. And after all what does real world mean? The images of the surrounding environment created in our mind by our perceptions, that is what we assume to be the real life. And university degrees help us develop a new way of perception. I am sure that the real world of a brick-layer can do without aspectuality or modality but don't mention something like that in front of a grammar professor.
Finally, if university degrees prove of no use for somebody they can remember the words of Ben Franklin: ""Experience keeps a dear school, but fools learn in no other"".

Sometimes I really don't know what to think.
It is possible that only a few of all humanity know how to dream and use their dreams and imagination to find a way in life, to find new ideas and attain old ideals.
It is possible that all the others have lost the gift of dreaming somewhere in their childhood or have lost it in the merciless whirlpool of life where troubles for the job, the kids, the mortgage, the future ( their personal or that of the whole world ) suck out their energy and turn them into wrecks at the age of forty.
The whole system operating in the modern world seems meaningless or maybe its meaning leaves little place for dreaming and imagining. It is like we are in a vicious circle - we study hard so that we could get a proper job, work hard so that we could lead a proper life and send our children to proper schools where they will study hard so that they could get a proper job and so on and so on . Is this what we were dreaming when we were kids? I think not.
I may have got a bit carried away but what I wanted to show is that it is not just science and technology that push the dreaming out of our life.
It is true that technology is all around us and we have became some sort of techno - addicts, this doesn't mean that we are techno music fans but that we just can't imagine our world without the innumerable technological miracles that make life easier for us . Computers , cell- phones, airplains or high-speed trains, microwave ovens and hundreds of other things are meant to save us time and energy. But what has happened is that they have made life faster so we spend more energy trying to keep up, and time even more valuable, hence we are constantly worried about running out of it. And when you are worried and lack energy your dreams turn to nightmares and your imagination can't overcome the reality.
However, it is also true that science and technology sometimes help us to stretch our imagination beyond the limits we are used to think of as insurmountable. So the question whether science and technology leave no place for dreaming and imagination is a rather equivocal one.
Up until now I haven't mentioned industrialisation. For me industry and dreams, industry and imagination are oppositions similar to such as black and white or good and evil. Just think of the term movie-industry ; this is a plain oxymoron - once the movies become a subject of industrialisation where is the meaning, where is the meaning of art, of the creation of something unique.
I have seen dream places turned to tourist paradises by industry, and I have seen dream places totally wiped out from the face of the earth again by industry. I have seen workers in the fishing industry stabbing dolphins so they bleed to death, and I have seen these workers walking in a sea of blood, the blood of thousands of this intelligent and gentle animals all killed in the name of industry.
If scenes like that don't kill your dreams welcome in the industrial world.
I can only dream of a world without industry .

Everyone assossiates the phrase ""modern world"" with industrialisation, science and technology. In the course of the years mankind has struggled and fighted in the name of those ideas. After all in the past ""industrialisation"" and ""technology"" have been nothing but a dream, an idea. I believe that if our ancestors have not used their imagination in the past, we would have still be dreaming of any development in these spheres.
I believe that only imagination and dreaming are able to make the world go round.
Sometimes I think that all the progress which the humankind has achieved is not worth if people become dull and unimaginative. In this case you do not need any progress; you do not care about development nor science. So, I suppose it is a rather complex matter which cannot be given an answer to in such a short essay.
From one point of view, there is a tendency for people to act just like machines - to forget about feelings, pride or sense. The more I think about it, the more people I see who behave like machines. Probably it helps them to become better professionals, or maybe they feel safer knowing that nothing can hurt them, being no longer simple humans. They take drugs, they do not have any friends and do not have fun because they do not want to be distracted from their work.
From the other point of view, there is this part of mankind which protests against industrialisation. And it is not a simple protest. They refuse to work, to be a part of the society because they do not feel they belong there, they do not feel close to these machines which everyone is trying to immitate.
So, here are the two groups, both of them having really strong reasons to defend their cause. I think that whatever happens there will always be two opposite oppinions.
My personal opinion is that, after all, a human is a human. No matter what you are trying to make of a human, a human always remains such. It cannot be transformed into a machine, as the bird cannot be transformed into an airplane.
It is a really weird world we live in. Trying to become everything else exept what we are - reasonable human beings, we make our lives as hard as possible.
I believe that there is a place for dreaming and imagining in our modern world. Every dream is like a flower springing from the earth, like grass growing up from a barren plain. I think that everything we have achieved is not the thing we need; the more we believe in industrialisation, the colder we become. Humans are made to feel... to feel pain, sorrow, anger, joy... Humans have to imagine, otherwise there will be no reason for them to exist. Humans have to dream or they will become merciless machines which will not need to imagine. I strongly believe that imagination will save us from extinction.

Every intelligent young person dreams to graduate from the university one day. It seems to be the highest goal in most of the young people's lives. They do anything possible to become suitable applicants to a certain university. On the one hand the troubles they take are reasonable - after graduating you have more possibilities for a career; there are quite a lot of roads you can choose to walk along. You can even choose whether to walk or run. On the other hand, the things you study, especially here, in Bulgaria are so far away from reality that sometimes you forget what exactly your subject is.
Although it might sound too sophisticated, the University as an institution is a dream.
Before having the chance to be part of it your imagination makes it look like a dome. You fascinate about just teachers and friends; you dream of the hundreds tones of knowledge you are to get there but when the last thrill about you being a part of the Great Dome is gone, you feel as if you are on an entirely different planet. What is more - and entirely different HOSTILE planet.
Anyway, you suppose there is a kind of mistake... And you keep on hoping. Until one day you forget the subject you are studying. There are so many courses you have to take that there is no time left for the ones you like. You do not have time to read a single book, you do not have time to do your homework... But who cares! You have chosen to be there and dropping out is out of the question. But you keep on struggling. You fight for the right to learn. I, myself was extremely excited last year, when I was a First year student; on the one hand I was totally ruined physically and psychologically by everything I had to do, on the other hand I was absolutely pleased with the things I learned. This year I am able to see that most of the courses we have to take are so far away from reality, from anything that could happen to us, that I start to get amazed.
Everything is so theoretical and unintelligible that I have, subconsciously, begun to think of transferring to another university. But I know that this wouldn't change anything. There is no chance. There is no hope. The situation is the same in the universities all over the country. You get so much information, you loose so much of your time that after five years you feel like an old person - you remember things and faces but almost nothing from the nearly fifty exams you have passed because the information you have got has nothing to do with everyday life.
Anyway, you graduate as a specialist. But it turns out that you are an expert only according to he documents. Otherwise it is all the same as if you have not spent these five years in the Dome. You have learnt everything by heart; you know how it works but you cannot make it work, you cannot turn it on. Nothing has been said about turning on in the textbooks and grammars...
Despite everything I do not think that it is not worth studying in the University. On the contrary, you learn and become better informed but I believe that it would be much better if students had the chance to study real things and to get better-prepared for the real life and the real problems they will face after graduating.

Do you remember your childhood? That little boy or girl for which every day revealed something new from the big mystery called life. That child which believed that our lives resemble a fairy-tale and that our days are given to us for playing and enjoying ourselves. What happened with that little child's dreams? But this question is not that crucial. Because no matter fulfilled or not we have to be proud that we had some dreams. More important is now to know if the following generations are going to have any. Are those little boys and girls after us going to be allowed to dream and imagine things and to have their childhood or are we going to rob them from it? This is what we have to think about before blindly industrializing everything. After all it is us that have to think what out lives should be like. And again it is us that have to be able to direct our lives in a desired way or direction. We can create machines that make many things for us but we cannot and should not programme them to live our lives instead of us. Which machine can compensate for the lack of understanding and civility or replace the natural communication between people? These are some of the notions that should always be taken into consideration and they should find a place in our plans for the future. There is no doubt that the mankind ought to develop, it has to go forward but this development has to include all spheres of life and especially our mentality. If not prepared mentally we will not be able to face the challenges of tomorrow . People have to be stimulated to think and to reach forward their aims. But as we all know very well every goal starts in the mind, at first it is an image, a dream, a concept of something desired. Only after a certain period of imagining and thinking can it become reality.
From this naturally arises the conclusion that if we stop dreaming and imagining we will certainly stop our mental, and consequently our technological progress. This is hardly what we want to do.
Because although sometimes it has unwanted results some progress is needed and is certainly necessary in order to make our lives easier by saving us both time and efforts through some of the technical inventions.
So we must not be against industrialization and technology themselves but against their unprecisely thought out usage, as for example in spheres where they are not very much needed and can create more new problems that solve some old ones.
However justice must be done to some branches of science whose development provides us with new exciting themes for imagining and dreaming. Which one of us, for example, has not been fascinated by the pictures which we get from the satellites and rockets which man sends to study the universe which is still hiding most of its secrets. All those far away worlds that used to be only fairy-tales for our predecessors are now taking more real shape for us. Having seen our beautiful planet from a distance, scientists are already planning the first tourist trips to different planets.
But besides enabling us to discover extra-terrestial wonders modern science allows people to look in greater detail to their own planet Earth. Many oceans and seas are now revealing their hidden long-kept secrets. Through special equipment, submarines or simply by switching the TV on, everyone can visit the amazing world of the ancient water gods and the Little Mermaid. We are able to see and experience astonishing things for which many generations of people could only dream. Unfortunately in our busy days we rarely have the time to think that what we have created and use today in our everyday lives has long been just a fantasy born in somebody's head which became reality for us.
So in order to go forward our mankind has to know exactly what it gains and what it loses from the advance of science and technology. The generations which are to come oblige us to think of all the positive and negative consequences which come with the technological progress, in order to reduce the negative ones. In this way our development will bring us and the environment more good than bad. And more importantly, on the brink of the second millenium we are going to be sure that there will be a place for dreaming and imagination for at least 1000 years more.

My opinion is quite contrary to the above statement. Since first reactions are said to be telling I would like to share my first reaction to the topic. This long and cumbersome sentence was dictated to us by our English teacher. When putting down such topics I am in the habit of writing automatically and half unwittingly. But on reading what I had just written, especially up to the question, I exclaimed rather indignantly ""bullshit"" and expressed these thoughts of mine in a written way by quickly scribbling ""I do not agree"".
My first reaction may, at first glance, seem a little bit imprudent, but it is not in the least such. I think that what inspired my snappish remark is the fact that I have some strong ideas on the topic. Namely, I consider imagination to be an inner quality and I see dreaming as an expression of one's imagination. I do not claim that this quality is inborn or innate. It can, of course, be developed and even exercised. And here technology and science can even be of help.
A case in point are the new computer games where the player is given almost complete freedom to choose what to do where to go and how to act at any given moment. It is the same case with the 3-D virtual reality games where one feels even closer to the real world. Moreover, within science and technology themselves, a lot of imagination is required. Try to imagine what it is to think of an unexisting concept of a new electronic device. Can you picture how these people's minds work if they were able to invent the telephone, the TV set the radio the computer, the Xerox, the camera etc. Undoubtedly, a lot of imagination and ""day-and-night"" dreaming must have been required and exerted. The case is almost identical with industrialization. You have to be really imaginative and broad-minded in order to be able to operate gigantic international enterprises such as Coca-Cola, IBM, KFC, CNN etc. You have to be imaginative too to utilize steel, coal etc.
But I come back now to my initial claim. Imagination and dreaming are completely independent of science technology and industrialization. They are individual qualities and it is up to each one of us to create his own inner worlds strange and odd as they may be. History has shown that there have always been dull and boring people ever since ancient times. But along with them there always have been these full of ""mad"" and new ideas. And just to introduce a new point at the very end which supports my view, as long as there is sex there always will be dreaming and imagination preceding, accompanying and following it.

I agree to a great extent with this statement and, especially with the part preceding the comma. I can talk, of course, out of personal experience most objectively but I think I can express as well the feelings of many students from other fields. These are people I have talked to about this partucular subject thus I have gathered their opinion.
Just before coming back home I met a friend of mine who after hearing I had to write this essay offered his assistance by giving me some ideas. He is a ""freshly-cut"" graduate from the University of Architecture in Sofia.What he said was that the topic of my essay was very precise in its determining the problem of their education. They studied piles of most probably useless information and data but did very little on the practical level. They did not attend the actual planning of a new building, park, stadium etc.
Another major problem this friend pointed out was the lack of updating students with the technological progress in the particular field of study or work. He says that now that he has graduated he has taken up a course in computers. At university, instead of using ready-made packets of computer programmes especially devised for the utilization of the architect's work, they studied programming which once again is obviously useless. Nobody is giong to create his own programme.
In the field of ceramics, for example, the problems are serious. The students' time is occupied by theoretical courses such as technology of clay, perspective, aesthetics, etc. but nobody teaches the students how to use the pottery wheel and how to whet on it. They are not taught either how to draw the different types of patterns that decorate the dishes.
In our department problems are similar. Instead of having as many contacts with native speakers as possible we take theoretical courses in syntax, semantics, morphology etc. We don't know how to use the vast number of English teaching computer programmes. We don't use any TV or VCR equipment to aid our education. To make the course more practical we could also increase the number of translation classes.
To sum up then problems seem to be quite the same in the different field of the higher education. To make the study more useful a balance should be reached where we are given just the necessary and important theory, thus leaving space and time for practical courses which prepare us for the actual face of the profession that we are to be confronted with in our ""working future"".

University education is often considered to be an important stage in a man's life which contributes enormously to his development not only as a professional but also as a human being.
This is the reason why the problem of attending a university or not should be tackled seriously and carefully by a high-school graduate. What such a person asks himself when considering this issue is whether a university diploma will provide him good future and professional acknowledgement in the real world. The answer to that question has more than just one aspect.
Without focusing our attention at the university degrees of a particular faculty we are quite familiar with the fact that most of them concentrate on theoretical points without offering any practical solution to the problems in question. Consequently, in the end it turns out that we have spent time and energy on dealing with issues and tasks which leave us unprepared for the real problems in our professional practice. What comes in our mind then is the conclusion that they are of very little value but is this really the way that this should be viewed?
My personal opinion on the matter is that no practice is possible without theory which to provide it with basis and means of realization. This is a widely-spread fact which validity was acknowledged by the natural course of historical events. However, like an enormous number of people involved in this problem, I am clearly aware of the imperative necessity for more practical knowledge which combined with the theoretical postulates to offer us a wide range of possibilities in the real world.
The question that often remains unanswered in my mind is what commands and imparts the dominantly theoretical viewing of the issues which we are concerned in. Perhaps this is due to the fact that it is easier to concentrate our efforts on some theoretical literature which all the libraries and bookshops are full of than to try to find real-life examples that will support our views.
The theoretical books we are preoccupated with offer us examples but very often they are obsolete or cannot be applied and realized in the society we live in. And what happens in the end is that we are full to the brim with a stunning variety of theoretical knowledge without knowing how to use it for the solution of our practical problems and as the basis on which we will lay the foundations of our further professional development.
The key to the problem is to enlarge the scale of knowledge required for university degrees by adding practical examples and issues to the established theoretical facts. Thus our education will prepare us for the challenges out in the real world and attribute considerable value to everything we have been engaged in during our years at university.

We live in a world dominated by science, technology and industrialization. There is no place for dreaming and imagination. After the exclusive scientific discoveries, the faith in some supernatural power that engendred and ruled man's existence, making him fully dependent on its unknown law, was shakened. The world's divinity seemed to had been an illusion that had served to give power in the hands of those who claimed themselves chosen by God. Unburdened from the heavy load of carrying a sinful nature and abandoned by the sheltering hand of religion's promise, people felt free to regard the world around them as something being what it seems to be. This newly adopted idea became the impetus of scientific researches and discoveries. And what if men then decided that while trying to find the lost meaning of existence in the new areas of science and nature, they could make their life a bit more pleasant and easy? Thereafter, technology and industrialization added to this process of making the world from a place of suffering, a place of happiness and contentment.
The scientific method underlook to reveal a world of stable, mathematically describable and predictable regularities, a vast mechanism - sheer surface with no ""inside"", a collection of particles orbiting about in space, ruled, by laws no human or other will could cause to swerve.
Science claimed (at last) the 'only' truth of things. And it seems to some that it really has revealed if not all, at least a great number of mysteries. Men have almost everything they thought it necessary to have or probable to need. Everything, except time. With the development of mechanization men are nowadays on the hunt for saving time, only for the sake of more free time, in fact. It is a vicious circle: the more free time they achieve, the more they spend it in saving more. The more money they obtain, the more they fritter away all of it, again for money.
Dreaming of money eats their time and dreams of free time eats the money... It turns out that maybe people have forgotten what the true aim of their scientific projects was - to make the dream of some great secret come true. Their everyday life has turned into a dull, monotonous, or nerve-racking experience that leaves in their minds no space for imaginative thinking, and brings them no benefit from dreaming. Everything around them is fixed and calculated. Life is ruled by the constructive experimentalism which ""solves"" all problems. But is not this struggle for accelerating the mankind's progress dwarfing the human concerns, by feeding on its limited time?
Man is not given the chance to find an adequate role for his imagination. More than that, he must sacrifice some of his precious time if he wants to enter the realm of dreams, and concequently face reality again. His dreams then make him vulnerable. His imaginative thought, his sense of imaginative identity, transforms him into an unhappy and isolated being. Every minute not spent in service to the techno-world, signals his falling behind. The rushing and noisy world is not interested in each one of its elements but only in the whole they form together. In this so called union of men's efforts, the ordinary, small and identified man is left entirely unobserved and neglected in terms of any emotional involvement - his dreams are not understood, his imagination is fettered. He is sentenced inevitably to imaginative decay.
It is easy to see the particular aims of science, this power-oriented knowledge, to exploit nature. But it is also easy to see the element of ""impoverishment"" if we take it as the only truth available. The human response to the essence of human experience exists in harmony with the exercise of critical analysis and rigorous observation. It is imagination that can arouse the enthusiasm for a hypothesis in a thinker, whose initial assumptions are often extraordinary wide.
It is when ideas are realized in imagination that the scientist is enabled to contemplate their actual validity. The beauty of the forest and the mountain rivulet may be irrelevant to the project of the engineer constructing his dam; but it is as much a truth of the world as the water's rate of flow and the stress to be sustained by the concrete wall replacing it. The purely scientific approach to human problems is mistaken, because it is only imagination which is equal to the encounter with humanity.

Cyberspace... She woke up from her two-hour sleep and sat naked in front of her lap-top. She had no time to dress up; something might be going on the Net which she was positive she didn't want to miss. She hated going out and meeting people. She always felt embarrassed whenever talking to somebody. She thought nobody liked her ... only few really did. But on the Net she was a vamp woman. Nobody minded her myopia and her acne problems - nobody knew about them.
Everybody thought she was attractive - that was what she told them. It was long ago since she swapped the real world - the veranda. the hammock, the cafe at the corner, her favourite novel for the world of cybermania. Every time she thought about it she felt robbed. She was a liar feeding herself on the lies of the others. And then she took another dose of virtual reality which would sooner or later send her to imminent virtual insanity. She killed her cat and bought a cyber one for there were too many hairs stuck to the carpets and furniture which she couldn't clean.
Cyber-cats saved her all that trouble. I think you know her. She lives next door.
Cats are useless. So are people. One can always buy a pet or a husband in the shop. Cyber pets won't scratch and bite you. They won't fill your wardrobe with hairs and won't puke on the bedcover. They will only 'beep-beep-beep' to show you they are hungry. You only have to press the blue button and it's OK. Cyber-husbands won't have their dirty linen for you to wash. They won't show their bald pates in the kitchen and grumble 'what's for dinner?' They won't be bald at all you can always choose what they will look like before you buy them. You can even phrase their speech and plug them in and out whenever you want to. That's already something! Men are also put at ease for they can also buy a cyber-wife. There inevitably comes the problem with food but it, like everything else, has already need each other for? Love will soon grow to be nonexisting concept because the feeling it stands for will soon be an extinct as the dodo. Besides, one can always get artificially inseminated whenever one feels prepared to have children. And in most cases people can even plan their children to be infant prodigies.
Soon nobody will fear death for here comes cloning - the password to eternity. You can have as many copies of yourself as you please - locked in the closet and waiting for your death just to be born.
Silence... Do we really love so much. It's noisy but it's strikingly quiet down there an the subway.
People in yellow mackintoshes not talking to each other ... thinking how fast the day succumbs to darkness and the darkness is overcome by light. They all cringe at the thought of deadlines and structural reforms in the company. Their minds function like clockwork mechanisms ticking away association after association into a whole stream of consciousness. And as soon as the doors open, the passive 'ticking' of their minds grows into an 'active' 'roaring' of their bodies - they start pushing each other, struggling to get to the surface, to cross the street and enter the office just in time to adopt the familiar 'robot attitude' towards their routine duties.
Their dreams however remain on the subway because they didn't have the courage to get off. So, they will be carried away and dumped in the dumpyard far away from the city. There they will be selected and sorted according to their contents and will be recycled for further use. Yesterday there was a conference of the scientists involved in this project where the chemists insisted that all dreams be used for dye: 'If dreams fail to paint our heads inside, let them do it from the outside.

If we ignore the years that have passed since the very beginning of industrialization, the time which has rendered this phenomenon something granted rather than a necessity or a helpful innovation, we are likely to take a view upon an entirely different world. We shall be captured by the magical aura weaving about each brand new article of invention. We shall experience a miraculous elation at the sight of machines - those intricate and inconceivably powerful products of human thought, and rejoice at the prospect of an affluent and creative existence. In other words, we shall live in a dream.
Has this dream faded since the time it belonged to our predecessors? Indeed, it has. For nowadays to the majority of us science and industry pass silently by one of the pages of students' books or stand secluded in laboratories and isolated in plants in the remotest areas of towns. What we actually care about is the conveniences which their products offer us. Processed food, for example, the luxurious limousine or the fast office computer are just pleasant instances of our everyday life. And if any of these machines unexpectedly fails to perform its duty, it will cause us no more than temporary frustration rather than leave us with the impression of something precious which we have lost. The dream has died!.. It has degenerated, turned into a petty commercial postulate called demand.
Still, in these days marketing seems to have received a new adventurous impetus. We are no longer satisfied with plenitude and fast computation. Our desires reach far beyond utility, into an imaginary world. I am speaking a place - a place, rather - modelled according to our fantasies, where our wildest dreams are promised fulfillment. Why should we marvel at our own ""simple"" (or perhaps ""wretched"") world now that we can make fairly-tales feel real? Virtual reality is spreading out over the market, both designed and pursued by desperate dreamers.
It is also generally acknowledged that we live in the age of art and entertainment, that is art in the context of mass culture. We are just beginning to give the scope to imagination - on every street corner and behind each door. Weird-shaped sculptures made of scraps, cuts in our jeans, strange antennae on the heads of high-fashion modelsA Who says we have stopped dreaming?
Art is all around us, squeezing and crushing us among images, shapes and sounds, having casually appeared in out minds.
Film industry, though still not as impressive as Virtual reality, is a mighty processor of all sorts of ideas. It enters each and every home, involves us into fictional happenings, makes us re-interpret and experience that spectacles on the screen. Since ten in a hundred people claims to be people of art, the queerest notions find realization, mingle and produce a colourful life - a picture of our imagination. For a while we wonder through a maze of creations to discover the one that answers our yearnings. Our needs have exceded the purely pragmatical state of demand, accomodations can hardly interest us any further . What we are already after is a supply of fantastic worlds.
Therefore, mankind is not, and has never been, in want of dreams. If there is anything we should question about the latter, it is their quality, not their existence. We are only too keen on spending our days, listening to a modern kind of music: savage, intoxicating, friendish and lacking all possible harmony. We can barely wait to create and consume fiction full vanity, fraud, bloodshed and vice. As for our much flaunted Virtual reality, it abounds in shooting car accidents, danger and fight. And for all of this, is there happen to be any objections at all, we have invented an even more terrible excuse: it is a realistic picture of life!
Let us try to ignore the evil, accumulated since the very beginning of pseudo-artification. We are likely to take a view upon more instances of an entirely different world. We shall be cheered up by a light imperceivable aura, streaming about the open-hearted relations of ordinary people. We shall experience a miraculous elation at the sight of each pure and simple act of help, sign of affection, or proof of love for our fellow-people, and rejoice at the prospect of a better existence. I
other words, we shall live in a wonderful dream.

BGSU1152,3.0,2.5,,,,,Most University degrees are theoretical and do not prepare us for the real life. Do you agree or disagree?,"
Having finished secondary school, some young people have developed an interest in a particular area of human knowledge. This is one of the reasons they may apply for a university. Another one is, of course, that they consider having a degree in a particular subject profitable.
Those who belong to the former category usually already have a certain amount of either practical or theoretical knowledge on their subject on entering university, whereas the latter do not necessarily have such.
In any case, practical skills and theoretical knowledge are equally important to an expert in any field.
It is a common phenomenon that people graduate from universities, get their first professional job and all of a sudden they find themselves totally incapable of performing any decisive step, although they are supposed to have studied what to do in such cases for four or more years. Why is this? Most probably because at university one receives primarily either well-grounded instruction or elaborate description. Rarely are students as lucky as to witness how those instructions and descriptions applied to real-life situations. Thus a boss who has hired somebody who has just graduated has to put up with at first paying them to learn how things are done rather than for doing thing. Now wonder, then, that experience is as highly valued as education proper when applying for a job.
Not providing practical skills to students is obviously a major fault with global higher education, although it may vary from place to place or from university to university.
On the other hand, it is as important, or rather it is necessary, to have reached a decent level of theoretical competence in the field one deals with. No student of medicine could successfully perform an elementary dissection without having accumulated a certain amount of anatomic and physiological knowledge.
Probably the only field of study that does not necessarily require theoretical information for better practical results is language acquisition. In this case, however, we digress from the point we have been so far making: as such a level of language acquisition is not the one that an expert is required to have reached. Take a schoolteacher, for example. Although pupils may not need to be fed in with loads of abstract linguistic data, their teacher has to be quite aware of the points and subtleties worthy of special attention in regard to their own native language.
So far we have been discussing the ideal education, but it is not so easy at all if one is to describe the status quo, and it even gets more difficult when one is to think of what might be done to bring about this transition from the status quo to the ideal education.
First of all, it is not easy to describe the status quo because things are very different in different countries, different universities, or even different departments. There is a widely accepted belief that the more you go to the west, the more practically oriented education gets and vice versa. I
will not now judge any particular system or curriculum because I am scarcely acquainted with any other but that of my own country. As of variation at the level of different departments or universities, it quite obvious. Students of medicine study very much theory and do lots of exercise. This is, as we already pointed out, absolutely obligatory for them. For this reason medical departments may probably be said to be most privileged in the respect of theory-practice balance. In all other cases, to my mind, either theory or practice is predominant.
The problem of what education should be and how to improve it has been dealt with for an exceptionally long time. I will not now offer any suggestion because there are, I believe, enough methodologists who have done and are still doing that.
Most important of all, though, is that theoretical or practical education is only one gear of the scholastic mechanism. Things largely depend in the students themselves. Some people are not prepared for the real life when they graduate university, others do not have problems of this kind.
One should never expect that teachers or any particular educational system can teach them whatever. Teacher and systems only help us learn and a student should develop their own strategy of learning and not expect some magic enlightenment to come from the teacher.
On the whole, education should neither be too theoretical, nor should it be exclusively practical. A
well-balanced combination of practice and theory is, in my opinion, the key to 'producing' 'high- quality' experts. Most essential, however, are the effort students put themselves. Teachers cannot transplant their knowledge to students - they are designed to only help students learn.

What does it mean to live? To live in a world of fantasy or in a real world? Maybe everyone can give an individual answer to this question. An old problem which still seems valid today: does a real world really exist or do we retire into own shrouded worlds, into our own ""whispering chambers of imagination"", do we surround ourselves with our own virtues, values, measures?
As for me, I am quite willing to believe that everyone lives "" in their heads"".
Living in the last decade of the 20th century. One feels more and more confined by the severe imprisonment of mechanisation, industrialization, science, technology. One is energetically and emotionally involved in the crazy, hectic rat-race of our modern world. And this rat-race squeezes our emotions, deadens our real human feelings and creates a 'clock-mad mechanism out of a human being. So, welcome to the machine.
In this world of science, technology, industrialization most of our activities run through a kind of narrow neck of a funnel. But out thoughts, our minds, our imagination cannot be confined.
Because, as the matter of fact, industrialization is in a way a product of human imagination. This maze of plans, schedules, machines is founded on human imagination.
On the other hand, eventhough we live in a kind of vicious circle, eventhough we are absorbed in numerous, meaningless, even absurd activities, we are free to let our fancies roam. Human strivings for knowledge are endless; human thoughts can escape from this rapidly changing world of new technologies, strange devices, inventions of all kinds, world of crazy experiments, complex apparatus, virtual reality, mechanisms, machinery, clock-works. One's mind is free, one can withdraw in a fictitious, fantasy world, in a world of dreams, an internal world where there is no verbal clarity.
The problem, however, is that man lives by force of habit, because we get into the habit of living first, and later into the habit of thinking. When one gets into the habit of thinking, one understands the absurdity of all these technologies, scientific achievements. That is why at a certain point of realization one becomes aware of the meaningless of the hectic, dusty, noisy electronic world surrounding us. A person who has become aware of their absurd existence tries to find the Real Thing in life, to start a new, active life devoted to self-perfection. Then life becomes a kind of rebellion against the harsh reality of life. Man's power is in his conscious rebellion against a reality which is much stronger than him. Maybe it is through imagination that one can escape from this harsh reality of life and enter a world of freedom, a world independent of time, society, space, technology, industrialization. Therefore, once we realize the absurdity of this humanized world we rebel against it using our imagination.
It is also because of the existence of art that we can safely assume that there is time for dreaming and imagination. It is in art where one can give the reins to one's imagination. One can transform the modern, industrialized world into a piece of art; because art is deeply influenced by one's inner emotions, thoughts, dreams, experiences. In fact, we can safely say that modern art is on the verge of unconsciousness, dreaming, knowing this. I nurse the hope that there will always be ""some unknown regions preserved as hunting grounds of poetic imagination.""

The world has lived through many ages till today, each of them being unique with something. For example, the Antiquity is characterized with a great human striving towards perfection, while the Middle Ages stand out with the surpressing of the human soul by religious canons. Nowaday's world is characterized with an intellectual genius stimulating the amazing scientific and technological progress. Computers dominate almost all crucial spheres of life and human creativity is taking multidimensions. Has human spirit came to an exhausting, however? Mankind has always been at some state of childish amazement before the mother nature. This is why its way forward has been so difficult and marked by mistakes, turning backs, and failures. Each human discovery, however, has been a revolution and human history is affluent with such revolutions. All of them have been a result of the incessant urge for seeking knowledge. The fact is, that if people can still be surprised by something, their spirit is not dead.
Let us look back at the different great stages in the world history. Each of them is marked by astonishing, even for today's concepts, human success in different areas. Whether it is arts and philosophy (for the Antiquity) or the gaining religious power (for the Middle Ages) or great scientific and technological advance (for the 19th century), people have always been living in peculiar times. Success, however, has usually been accompanied by boredom because people have thought that there has been nothing left to discover. Maybe this is the cause.
It is quite true that all that people talk about today are computers, machines, money and their various derivatives. These are topics not only among groups of computer and engineer specialists, but what is most stricking, in common everyday exchange. It is difficult then not to think that all these modern technologies will influence our lives in the greatest possible extent - mainly overtake them (which according to some people they have already done) and leave no room for such outdated sentimentalities as dreaming and imagination.
A curious thing happened to me recently. I was sitting on the bus on my way home when a couple of boys sat behind me. I couldn't see their faces but they sounded not more 11 - 15 years of age.
All the time they talked about computer games. The astonishing thing was that they talked with such passion and excitement as if they were describing real-life experiences that had happened to them and quite impressed them.
I couldn't help overhearing their conversation (they spoke loud enough for the whole bus to hear them) and it made me think about some things. Things like books, to name but one. Risking to sound like an 80-year old person, I still remember the time when me and my friends talked about books that impressed us and we dreamed and felt together with their characters.
A very famous statement is that books are the food of imagination, giving us ""wings"" to fly in non- existent but perfect worlds of our own. Considering this, the main threat that technologies and industrialization present is direct towards books, which in fact are the most beautiful and valuable creations of human imagination. However, there are still schools, universities and libraries on the whole institutions where books are highly respected. As long as these continue to exist there is hope that people will have something to dream about and occupy their imagination with.
Finally, dreaming is the most efficient way to escape away from our bitter reality, especially when you don't have the financial means to do so. It's also the best way to cope with your problems (even for a few minutes) without indulging yourself into numerous vices of our modern society.
With all this in mind it will be difficult for ""some people"" to deny dreaming and imagination their rightful place in our modern world.

BGSU1173,3.0,3.5,,,,,"In his novel ""Animal Farm"" George Orwell wrote ""All men are equal but some are more equal than others"". How true is this today?","
Equality has always been a widely discussed topic. People from all epochs have thought about it, they have been trying to define it and last but not least they have been trying to put it in practice.
No one has succeeded in it yet and I think that on one ever will.
On the one hand, equality is given by birth. It is said in the Bible that all men were created equal.
But this is where the whole thing starts and ends, because from this moment on people and their lives do not longer depend on natural laws, but on other, social factors. Because we are all born equal but our abilities, talents and ambitions will take us to the place in the social hierarchy we belong. And along this social hierarchy we can see that some people are more equal than others and they can never be equal to those who stand below them. And even in court, when the judge says that all men are equal before the law, we know that they are not. Those who have the greater power and the stronger will will always win.
Equality is also one of the major principles of democracy and almost all modern societies claim to be democratic. But equality is something completely missing there. A famous song gives the answer to this unstated but obvious question: ""It is funny how money and power changes the situation."" Nowadays money and power gives you the ""right"" to be ""more equal than others"". And in my opinion this will never change, because this is how human society works. Some are stronger than others, they are more ambitious, they know what they want and how to get it thus taking a higher position is society.
On the other hand, however, some people are not created equal, for example, coloured people. It seems that we are now living in a world dominated by people whose skin is white are directly considered to be inferior. Lately, the struggle against racism has intensified greatly and many people start to understand that the colour of your skin is not the most important thing. But still, the number of prejudiced people takes prevail over the others who are not prejudiced, who are ready to accept people for what they are, not for what they look like, So, this groups of people are considered ""less equal"" from the moment they were born. But there are also such people who were born ""more equal than others"". Aristocrats, for example. They inherit their title, thus acquiring everything that goes with it and no matter what they are like as social beings they are still ""more equal"".
All in all, equality is only an existing term that cannot be seen put to practice. It is impossible for all people to be equal, because I think that this will bring human society to an end and people, I am afraid, will not survive without society. But we should still fight those racial attitudes and keep to the simple thing - all men should be born equal, but whether they will be more equal than others should be left to them to show.

The question about equality among people evokes a lot of contradictory opinions and ideas. I all men are equal they are supposed to have equal rights, equal opportunities and chances in every sphere of life. On the other hand all people are equal because they live on the same planet, breathe the same air under the same sun. These biological criteria, however, define another kind of equality - we are all equal because we all belong to nature. At the same time we are different - living in different parts of the world, having different culture, habits and views of life. The circumstances around us are different and they are actually the prerequisite of an other kind of equality - the social one which I already dropped hints about in the beginning.
So, it turns out that on the one hand we are all equal as the most complex animals of nature and on the other hand we are not so equal because of some different social conditions. There is one very clear example to this statement - the comparison between a rich man and a poor one. Are they equal? Biologically - yes but socially they have nothing in common. One of them has money, influence, power, connections and all this provides him with luxury and comfortable life. The other one has to struggle every day to make his living, to buy foot and clothes and hardly will he ever be able to get to the rich man's position. He is poor and there is no doubt that he is more equal to his next door fellow rather than to the rich, inaccessible person. The latter one, in turn, is equal to the people who have the same or nearly the same position as his. However, this person is not so equal to those that stand higher than him in society. That's how the social ladder is constructed.
The steps follow one another not in a horizontal line but in a vertical one showing the gradual rise to the top. The steps have the same form and dimensions but they are placed in different positions one above the other so that the top and the bottom are clearly designated. That's how it is with people. They are divided into classes according to their income, property, education. They can move from one class to another which depends on their own strategies for getting equal to the representatives of a certain class. So in a way they can either fight for equality or they may not want it. For example the poor man wants to be equal to the rich one so he has to fight for it because it's very hard to achieve it. The rich one, however, will hardly have the desire to get down to the poor one's position. Yes, they may both have the same rights but this is not enough to make them equal. The rich one will always stand higher then the poor one unless he loses all his fortune, connections, influence and friends which is very unlikely.
So, it turns out that today we can very easily say that all people are equal but some are more equal than others. There is equality based on biological factors which defines people just as human beings. There are also some grades of equality according to which people are divided into different social groups so that people from one group cannot be equal to those from another one.
This appears to be a natural law in society and probably it will always exist.

Is there a place for dreamers in our world which seems to obey the rules imposed by the rapid development of science and technology? Or, can imagination thrive in an environment dominated by industrialization.
No doubt, these questions should be paid more attention to, especially in the context of the century, or, to be more precise, the year-thousand we have just entered. Looking for an answer to them. We might well learn something more about the true nature of our world and our society, and, perhaps, about the laws which govern them.
At first glance, there seems to be a great abyss between the requirements of the modern world, which are to be fulfilled by the development of technology and industrialization, and the longings of the human soil, which we identify with dreaming and the flight of imagination. Most people claim that our world somehow doesn't allow for ""imaginative distractions"". Dreaming, they say, can't coexist with the pragmatics of our existence today. There seems to be some kind of incompatibility, or some sort of discrepancy between these.
Still, one might ask oneself about the thing which made industry and technological progress possible. It was and it is imagination. No doubt, human imagination has some sort of great constructive power. Actually it is the basic source of the various inventions which have become an inseparable part of our lives and which do continue to astonish us with their technological properties, with their multifunctionality and, why not, peculiarities. In other words, imagination and industrialization are not to be opposed but to be seen as parts of a whole, or, rather, as part of a cycle: imagination 'creating', so to say, industry; industry and its needs giving an opportunity for imagination to thrive; then again imagination 'inventing' industry ... In fact, this is the pure logic of technological and industrial progress. Imagination is simply part of it.
On the other hand, dreaming is considered to be some kind of escape from the negative effects of technological progress. In a way, the act of dreaming 'denies' the hectic aspect of our world and is a certain sort of reaction against some phenomena which, sadly have become typical of life nowadays - alienation, over-mechanization of the objective world around us and, surprising though it may sound, 'mechanisation' of human relationships. In this sense, dreams and imagination are something of a necessity for us. They help us survive spiritually and create our own space, or, our own small world which deprived of the complexities 'outside'...
To sum up, even though it may sound absurd, it's our technology - dominated world that determines the importance of dreams and imagination for the human beings. As it is the two worlds - the objective one without and the subjective one within us don't oppose each other but are independent. One allows place for the other. Actually that's the complex nature of our existence.

It is true that we live in a world dominated by science and technology, it is true that we witness something that has never before happened - the relationship man - machine, or in particular man - computer. At first sight these examples seem rather material and one hardly can associate them with phenomena such as dreams and imagination. Yet, we mustn't forget that dreaming and imagination as essential part to science technology as, in a way, our brains to us. Dreaming and imagination are the things that made that advance of science possible.
We should not forget that throughout the years man's imagination and abstract thinking have pushed everything forward. Besides, we can't deny that what we see around us is what was in the heads of many prominent men. For example, the prototype of a flying apparatus was a result of Leonardo da Vinchi's gift to imagine things, and, I will say, it comes as no surprise to us that nowadays planes and all forms of aircraft, products of science technology and industrialization , are 'vital' to our lives.
Although generally considered, that science is more powerful than anything else, that anything in theory can be deemed possible or not, I would like just to mention that our dreaming and imagination are second to nothing. Everything is possible on our minds. What's more, science is easily refutable. When in the beginning of the century somebody said that the chemical composition of stars would never be found out, that people realise the power of imagination. Still, a couple of years later, due to man's imagination devices were invented and stars became known to us. As Arthur Clarke put it 'what science claims impossible, imagination is always on the other side of the street.' There is nothing more pleasant than witnessing the fruits of dreaming and imagination.
Indeed, our modern world is dominated by the real pursuit for scientific development and industrialization and people often forget the driving force of this pursuit - imagination. I would like just to point out that these can be considered to be just another form of imagination - the material realization. As far as I'm concerned this is definitely so. Science and technology, research, industrialization are the modern forms of imagination.
We have already conquered and explored thoroughly the Earth and partly bits of our Universe, we did what we could because of the dominance of science. But as I said science is a fleeting concept and it often changes its perspectives. Dreaming and imagination are the key factor for any change within the frame of science. For good or bad, we don't know and cannot predict what imagination holds in stare in future and the extent to which science, technology and industrialization will dominate our lives.

Equality, to my mind, is something that is used as term by mathematicians. What is equal? Well, something that is the same with something else. A mathematician will give many and various examples of equality; but the better part, if not most of them, will be in the field of figures and numbers. I personally think it not to be the same case in life. The life we live is not a big equation in terms of numbers.
If we look around, we will see that the principle of equality is not applicable to reality. Who is equal to whom what is equal to what? Questions that probably would not be given an answer. Of course, there are factors that contribute to what we see - that some ""man are more equal than others"". As we look in this quotation itself we see that there is hardly a man who makes a comparison with the adjective equal. But that is another kettle of fish, something within the language, and we need visible and tangible evidence.
One such a topical piece of evidence is money. Money makes people different. Some people have it, some people do not. It is simple, but money makes lives different and so does people.
Everybody has clothes, books, in most cases - car, flat, house, but all that is of different make.
Some goods are for those who are ""more equal"".
Another piece of evidence that is as simple as the first and that supports the thesis that there is no equally or ""some are more equal than others"" is the particular behaviour and cultural background people have. Who is 'more equal"" in his behaviour a teacher or a plumber; a driver or a doctor. I think nobody will deny that there is a difference.
Last but not the least important, I may will point out that appearance makes us different. It is a plain statement, but is it not relevant? We can see that a person takes after somebody else so much as to be his living image, but I myself will say that man in himself is not equal. No half of the human body matches the other.
Indeed, people strive to be equal, but I think that is because those who govern us misuse the fact that people can be tempted by the principle of equality and still try to implant it. Equal rights, equal privileges, equal social benefits, equal standards of education and so on and so forth - things that can be heard and promised but not attained as a set goal. The world is meant to be different, people are meant to be different and equality is something possible within the domain of science.

Finance in our modern world plays the greatest role of all. As a matter of fact it deserves an Oscar for its performance so far. It reigns over all aspects of human life and society - money has become a vital part of our existence and we need it as desperately as we need air to breathe and sun and water to support our living.
The famous quotation: ""Money makes the world go round!"" sums up as briefly and accurately as possible the essence of human society today. A plain and well-known fact is that people are obsessed with money and this is no longer considered a mental disease as other obsession are but the normal state of human affairs. In the society that we have built our life depends wholly on the money - if you have it you will be well-off and you'll live, if you don't then you can expect only the worst.
So, logically here comes the question why some people have more money than others and there are such that have no money at all. It is not an easy question to answer but if we take the title to be the most justified answer that we can safely conclude that there is something very wrong in our society. In fact there is, it is exactly this unequality of rights and possibilities which makes the rich richer and the poor poorer.
Probably the decision of this problem must be careful and exact application of the title of this essay but then it appears quite difficult to estimate someone's contribution to society. This is such a subjective issue that it is almost impossible for extremely subjective creatures as ourselves to accomplish the task. If we manage to do this then all our problems will be solved.
Equality as a social issue has been one of the major problems in the human society for centuries.
Since the dawn of civilization, the human society has been structured and divided into levels, ranks, classes or whatever one likes to name them. And since then the struggle for equality has never seized.
But what exactly is equality and how has it been treated through time?
In the past centuries equality was understood more or less in terms of wealth and nobility. There were rich and poor, noble and ordinary people. Society was divided into classes and one was considered equal only toe the people belonging to the same class.
Nowadays, things inevitably have changed. Our society is still divided into classes although many people deny that. Moreover, more divisions have been made in terms of religion, sexuality and so on. However, people feel more equal than ever before. Not only because the gaps between the classes have become smaller but because today equality is a state of mind.
Today, the first part of Orwell's statement ""All men are equal"" is the basis of many constitutions and declarations for the human rights and all politicians claim that people are equal because they have been given equal opportunities to succeed in life. Perhaps there's some truth in that.
Perhaps today it is not so important who you are, where you come from, how rich you fee. It is what is in your mind that counts, not in your pocket.
However, there are people who cannot ""feel equal and think equally"". The paradox here is that the problem is not in their mind but in their pocket. Because in our money-driven world it is extremely hard to live, exist even, let alone think and feel. Many poor people are bound to struggle for their living and does not consider themselves equal in any way to a rich businessman, for example. It is not that they cannot think and feel, they are stupid or insane but because they are mentally suppressed by the injustice of their life. In this sense, Orwell's statement is still true today. Some people are more equal then others because they have or are given the ability to feel so. Perhaps, it is trues in milder terms but let's hope we will be able to change that.

Once the American president John Kennedy said something about the issue which will be discussed in this essay. His point was that one should not ask what the United Stated can do for them but what they can do for the United States. So, in the ideal situation one should contribute to the society they live in without expecting any reward at all. But as far as anyone has financial obligations, such as bills, rents, taxes, etc. this idea cannot be applied in real life. Besides, there is no living creature, at least not a human being, who can be made to work without and reward, whether it is financial or of some other kind. Of course, when stating this we should say that it refers to the present only it was not so long ago when slavery existed. Yet, slaves were at least given food, so even they got some kind of stimulation.
From the things mentioned above a very obvious conclusion can be drawn that in order to meet their needs people go to work and get a certain financial reward for the job they do. But here arises the more important issue of how much exactly should a person get for his or her contribution to society, or in other words who contributes more to society? Doctors or businessmen? At first sight it is clear that doctors should get the highest financial reward because there is no need to question their contribution to society, at all. But it is common knowledge that businessmen earn a lot more than doctors. However, this fact can be easily explained.
Businessmen are not paid by somebody else for their job. That is, they hind of personal reward themselves, so that is not a good example of fair distribution of remuneration. If we go back to the doctors again, it turns out that in some countries, particularly those of Eastern Europe, they get even less than skilled manual workers, whose job is not of primary importance to society but who work in the private sector, so if everything works right (which is often not the case in Bulgaria) the more they produce, the more they are likely to get as a financial reward. So, it turns out that the meaning of the word ""contribution"" has to be redefined for every particular society.
In addition, I would like to mention two more burning issues: pensions and women's payment, including child benefits. People who are retired evidently do not contribute much to the society, however they have done so far the most part of their lives and in my opinion, although they do not have the needs of a young person, they still deserve an honourable place in society. When mentioning women I mean that in some countries they are not equally paid with men even though they do exactly the same job. Besides, how can one estimate the contribution of a mother by paying her child benefits which are not enough even for a pair of baby's shoes.
To conclude with, people's financial reward is often not commensurate with their contribution to society. However, there was one tiny bit in the statement discussed. It says ""the society they live in"". So, it is not their fault if they live in the wrong society, that fails to provide them with what they really deserve.

Before going into discussion of the topic it might be better to specify what exactly 'equal' mean.
What do people understand by the word 'equal'? And by giving a clear definition it would than be easier to explain what we think about the statement and how true this is nowadays.
We live in a free country where you have the right to have your own point of view, to share your ideas with no fear what so ever. Therefore, even the meaning of a simple word requires your own opinion which varies from one person to another.
When we talk about people being ""equal"" what I personally imply in the meaning is that all people deserve the same rights as each other; they should have the same status; there should be no class division. But does this reality hold true today? To my opinion, the answer is 'no'. it is true hat we are all born equal, but what happens to us afterwords. Our lives take different directions, some live in luxury while others are on the other side of the line, wondering how to make it until the next day. The sad think is that if you are wealthy enough you can achieve all your goals although you may not deserve it. But if you are poor, if you cannot satisfy your needs no matter that you are clever you cannot develop as a person. You cannot achieve any progress in your life.
On the other hand, men can be equal but only before God and the law. God created us all the same and one day when our turn to stand before him comes he should than regard us a s equal.
No-one knows weather this is true or not but at least that is what the Bible teaches us.
""We are all equal before the law"". The law is the same for everyone. But again if we stop and think more carefully about this statement we may spot certain gaps. Nowadays, we have witnessed how people who really deserve to be punished get away with it, and this arises yet another question: Is Temida blind? So, how can we say that all men are equal at all?
As I previously said to be equal people should be treated the same way with no exeptions what's so ever. But today there is no evidence in favour of this statement. I have tried to find even one but again, as it always happens, there is an exeption for everything. We have lived with that so far and we will continue this way as long as the world exists.

This morning I was violently pushed out of my sweetest dream. Oh! Was that the telephone? Oh, yes I remember now I had asked someone to phone me and wake me up for my exam. You know, I have this habit of ever sleeping. I rose, grabbled the receiver and I heard my friend's voice. Well, I decided that I'll take a little nap - for 15 more minutes - after all the alarm clock is to ring at 7. Yes, its piercing sound definitely got me out of bed.
Devices... wouldn't it have been great if they did not exist? Maybe I'd have asked a friend to come and wake me up with a cup of coffee and breakfast in bed. Romantic, isn't it.
Sometimes all this definitely ruins my balance. The traffic noise peers into my brain just as the worms in the cursed apple. Maybe I know how Nature feels now.
Dreams and imagination are sort of taboo in our world, where everybody is occupied with their egocentric desires. Technology definitely leaves on space - would you want to fly - if you'll already in a position to ravel free in air; would you write a letter, sealed with a kiss if you can simply send an e-mail, would you go to Paris if you can experience a visit through this virtual reality device, would you?
Maybe I was not born to live in this world - or at least not in this decade - maybe even not this century. A romantic soul - that's what I am - I'd prefer walking on foot, to travelling with bus, writing letters in the old-fashioned way than e-mailing them, making coffee in the old-fashioned way, cooking as I am used to - no micro waves - I hate this idea of everything being so easy and approachable.
What I can't figure out is hoe I will manage to convince other people in my idealistic theories of the world, because if there's no technology, no science - what it follows logically that there'll be no competition, no controlled experiments, no money-awarded achievements. And then it might turn out that people are a little happier - maybe simply because they'll not constantly worry not to forget to turn the electrical devices off while they're away or panic that they might get stuck in the elevator.
It actually poses a great difficulty to me - whether I want to be the perfect embodiment of the contemporary world or do I simply want to kick up in a chair and start dreaming ...
I'd rather choose the second. It seems of not a better at least a more interesting perspective.

Equality is a historical question. George Orwell was not the first to put it down. The debate for equality had probably arisen since the beginning of the world, since Adam and Eva, and has been a major theme not only in the antiquity, but in the middle ages, it is a major problem now as well.
Only that its aspects and nuances have changed through time. From the beginning it was the order of Matriarchy. But then came the question: why are women more important than men?
What makes them more significant, and what gives them this role? The things changed. But this shift was no preliminary act to equality.
In the middle ages the greatest issue was equality - in one or other form. Either for voting power or for equal start in life. But despite the attempts of people there were always divisions and differences. The opportunities were never equal.
Nowadays it's difficult to define the boundaries. But still maybe in our consciousness or even in our subconsciousness we realize that there are such boundaries. Where do they lie? Perhaps the answer of this question is not that easy to find. But perhaps Orwell had not meant that some people are more equal - just that they are more privileged.
In every society there are rules and principles. But not principles of unity - these of division and selectivity are that reign.
Some people are equal - yes, but only in the limitations of a specific social group and the terms are not the same outside it.
The notion of equality is not an ideal, it's not an aim, because everyone recognizes that this aim would be groundless and impossible.
There are inferiors and superiors, and rich and poor, and workers and masters. There have been since the beginning of the world and there will always be. Each of us, who tries to abolish these relations would end with on result. Because noone could ruin an order, and organization, a hierarchy that had been existing for hundreds of thousands of years.
""If man is an animal, caught in webs of significance, he himself has spun to those webs"". No one wants to be equal with others because they want to be themselves.
The aspiration of people lies in other forms - they do not wish to be equal with everyone. Men wish to be equal who stand higher in the hierarchy of the society.
In the long run, we realize that not the tendency to equality is what keeps the world turning, but the competition, the desire to do better in life and to make more achievements.
Besides, if we are all equal by rule, then why should we live? And what should we live for?

It seems to me that G. Orwells statement is a brilliant one: short, exact and true. However, it is also a controversial thesis. It is true that all men are equal, but from whose point of view? And it may well turn out that some people are more equal than others. The truth must be somewhere in the middle.
On the one hand, we are God's creatures and have one soul, four limbs (two hands and two legs), two eyes, two ears, etc. In this religious sense, equality means that we all come from one and the same place and deserve to enjoy life on Earth, but we cannot forget that not all of us will go to the same place after Death's embrace. To the Christian God we, humans, are equal, except for the established men's superiority over women. It is our life that brings about inequality, because our -deeds and free. will determine our. so to say, destination - Heaven or Hell.
On the other hand, people can never be equal in society, because they belong to different classes in the so-called social hierarchy. If we imagine a pyramid we will easily guess that its top is occupied by the highest, most important and most responsible social ranks. The higher you climb the ""social ladder"", the more privileged you are. Hence, we can talk about social inequality.
Even if we look at the smallest ""cell"" of any society - the. family, we. will be confronted with the inequality in the male and female social roles. Usually, the man is expected to be the breadwinner while the woman is perceived as a mother and a wife. who is the one to provide peace and harmony in the home and raise the children.
Moreover, the male - female sex distinction has always been valid in terms of politics. Nowadays, things are somewhat different from the past when a president, a leader of a party, an MP, a judge, etc. could become only a man. In politics, we observe a perfect example of men's inequality: the. competition for political power among superiors and their subordinates will be held till the world turns.
Last hut not least, I want to talk about men's equality (or rather inequality) in historical terms. The human race has passed through many stages in its history, each of which can be characterised with different concepts of the ever so much looked for ""ideal"" society. Our ancestors had lived in the primitive society, in which, I think, people, were most equal to one another and had much more equality of opportunity than our contemporaries have in the modern world. Not to mention that the life under feudalism, capitalism and communism, is lacking in equality and we can hardly talk of balance, respectively between rulers and slaves, wealthy landowners and impoverished wage-labourers, a single ruling party and working masses.
In conclusion. George Orwell was amazingly right when he wrote in Ills novel ""Animal farm"" that some ""men are more equal than others"". As far as I can see, inequality spreads more and more in all spheres of human life as a result of the booming 'progress"" of civilisation. The most grave consequences that the future generations might face will be human beings striving for money, that is for alienation, inequality and loss of individuality. You may say that this, is not what the 21-th century wants us to strive for, but as the saying goes, he who pays the piper calls the tune.

From the moment of his birth one stands living surrounded by people who, in some way are limited with him. Initially these are the people from ones family, afterwards the children from the quartet one lives in and later - the comrades from school or colleagues from the university. Being surrounded by people all the time, one strives to find a suitable place among them as well as being positively appreciated by them. For example, small children are very satisfied by the praises they received from adults and their peers. On the other hand, children enjoy the presents and it is the presents that are the reflections of adults' opinion concerning children's behaviour and achievements.
As far as pupils are concerned, the many they get at school and their classmates' and teachers' respect are the things with which pupils' contribution to the society they live in is measured.
Things concerning the people at mature age are much more complicated. They have already chosen their way in life and usually have work which they like and seek to succeed in it. Such people make great efforts in order to be noticed and appreciated by the society. However, this does not always work then they fill disappointed, misunderstood and dejected. They consider society to be their oughter for not being able to evaluate them properly. These people are astounded by the easiness with which some of their colleagues achieve everything they have been dreaming about without much effort. They consider their colleagues to be lucky people and think that destiny protects them and gives them chance in life.
In life lucky people are even less than the dissatisfied that is why very often they are object to other people's admiration and envy. A lot of people are interested in their private life because the lucky ones are considered to be perfect.
At this moment out country is in a very difficult economic conditions. Most people do not receive financial contentment that will contribute to the society they live in. A great number of people wonder why teachers continue to work as they have not received their salaries for months which are also very low. The same is the situation with doctors who, for their highly qualified labour and great responsibility for saving human lives receive very small incomes. However, above all, they keep on working, ignoring the financial side of the question, because their efforts bear moral contentment to them. Nothing is more satisfying than seeing the joy in the eyes of the man whom you have just extracted from death and taken back to life , nor, with the teacher's pride who enjoys his pupils' success. However, not everybody is capable of enjoying such things. For this reason society is an oughter to such people. To my mind, nowadays everyone should get financial as well as moral contentment that will contribute to the society and country they live in.

In 1989 when communism was replaced by democracy, Bulgaria witnessed great political, technological and social changes. Not only people's dreams changed, life itself changed.
Today we live in a world ruled by science and technology, which make human life easier. Modern technology makes it possible for farmers to produce increasing amounts of food. Every day, in hospitals around the world, lives are saved through technological devices. Millions of people earn their living because of such inventions as the airplane, the automobile, and the computer. But apart from its advantages, technology has stolen something from people. That is their inner world, their dreams and imagination.
At present time, computers are used everywhere, and I think that in ten years' time human life would be impossible without them. That is why, from an early age children prefer surfing in Internet and playing games to reading books. Kids spend most of their time sitting in front of computers or TV sets and that deteriorates their image of the world. They no longer bother to study or read because most books are already filmed, and in their mind, it is more logical to watch a three-hour film than to sit at home with a book all day.
Moreover, youths find that the reading of fiction is not only boring but totally useless and impractical for their future. So, it seems to me that lately people are turning into machines. They confine themselves to work and do not feel any joy of living. Human beings resemble kids who have lost their faith in Santa Clause and will never believe in him again. Pity though, technology doesn't seem to help them much. Internet only pours down all kind of information. Often, little children don't know how to use this information, and they grow up too fast without being able to discover the world for themselves. Consequently, It is not surprising that there are few things which seem unknown to youths in the year 2001.
In addition, no matter that technology is highly developed, and that people have access to any piece of information, there ate a few children who really want to learn something. My observation is that being offered a lot of entertainment, expensive technological devices enough freedom, they really make efforts to develop their mind, to get to know themselves. For instance, I have a friend, whose family is absorbed with their television set. They would sit and stare at the TV for hours without uttering a word. As I see it, these people don't even know each other, they prefer watching soap-operas to communicating. You may not agree but technology has to do with that apathy in people, with that total alienation.
However, there is another factor apart from technology that contributes to the lack dreaming and imagination. That is the hard situation in Bulgaria at the moment. There are two nations living in our country the rich ant the poor. People are not paid enough for their work and according to their contribution to society. Most Bulgarians hardly earn their living and feel depressed. Every where I go, I see gloomy faces, and it is not surprising people's dreams seen to have given way to desperation. Five years ago, as far as I remember, people still dreamt that things would become better but now there are few people, who believe in empty promises.
Yet, people continue to dream. Young people dream to leave the country and find a job abroad.
Old people dream to be able to their central heating and have money to buy bread. Unfortunately I doubt that anyone who was living twelve years ago had the some humble dreams. But being an optimist, I still believe that he should not allow irritation and poverty rob our hope for the future. To cope with the present problems we should rely on each other and love each other. Not technology but love will help us believe in progress again.

It has passed quite a long time since dreaming and imagination -were regarded as enemies to man, progress, literature and arts. Their place in our lives, I think, has increased and is even being promoted by science and technology.
First of all, a major problem that can arise is that of the connection between imagination and science and the influence they exert on one another. By imagination, I understand, anything said, -written or part of our thoughts that does not exist at the present moment, having in mind that it can either materialize or not. By science I mean, any study into a particular subject that brings about changes, sheds light on unknown matters or makes possible things people have only DREAMED of. So, no doubt many scientific breakthroughs are the result of someone's imagination - imagination is only beneath the surface, science is its manifestation. The link between science and imagination is not only evident, it is necessary. By -way of an example, the dream of having two absolutely identical copies of whatever living thing is on the road of becoming true -with the doubling of the sheep Dolly.
Unfortunately, science helps many ideas inimical to people's -welfare materialize, but there is. I
am afraid, an inevitable consequence of people's desire for power, money and so on. However, this desire is closely related to the general progress of the world in different spheres; imagination has led to development in entertainment (e.g. computer games), education( you can fish as much information as you want from Internet on any subject you are interested in, and this is a result of people's imagining to save time and do a certain job for quite a short time, fashion (now you can acquaint yourself about he latest design of trainers -with one click of the mouse) and others.
Are not computers a typical example of a long-expected dream of keeping in touch -with people all over the world any time of day you like?
What is a more serious problem to tackle is not imagination as being ""suffocated"" by the -world of science, rather, -we - people - having to use our imagination much more than people did before.
Science and technology develop so fast, -we are being flooded with so much information, that we have to invent newer and newer things in the sphere we are working in in order to survive on the market. No matter whether it is fashion, education or business, competition compels any firm or organization to find new, original ways of winning clients. All these leads to many bad effects on people - overworking, stress, less sport, less care for ourselves and others.
As far as dreaming is concerned, perhaps the most worrisome thing is do people find TIME for dreaming? I think that has not come to be a problem for us, Bulgarians, yet. It is, however, for countries like USA maybe, where people work longer hours, or work on two places in order to keep up with the times. In spite of this, I think that even they have time to dream. The reason why this is so is the fact that, firstly, dreaming is not something that can be applied to some people only; it is an inherent quality or trait of character - any person can and does dream at some time or another. And secondly, dreaming, I have no doubts about that, has many positive effects on people - it is a way of escaping reality, a way of relaxing, it is a way of being what you really are, it is something we can have only to ourselves. Of course the debate of whether has only positive effects is still at present, and I agree, that excessive production of dreams can lead to undesirable effects like becoming passive, detaching from reality, creating a world where everything is easy and beautiful and a refusal to face the facts and problems of real life, but on the whole, when speaking of the place drams have in our lives I think this pros- and- cons - about-dreaming debate is irrelevant. Dreaming will not die easily because it gives us one of the most important factors for being happy-freedom, no matter it is (only) in our dreams.

Has a bully ever tormented you? Has anyone looked down upon you because of your social status? Has money ever come between you and another person? Has life ever been ""unfair"" to you? What is ""fair""? Actually, what is equal? Equal in what? Equal in chance? Equal in rights?
If you have ever asked yourself at least one of these questions and answered positively, then you openly admit the lack of equality of any kind among humans. The mere Idea of parity is as surreal as can be. If ever such a thing existed or exists it was or is artificial, therefore ephemeral and corruptive of the mind and identity of every individual. We are not the same! Fact: we look different, we think different, we act different, we can in a different way. Conclusion: we ARE different. There is no common denominator under which you can place people. People of different ability, realization and contribution cannot be equal. Such is the human mind that it grades everything. There are categories, criteria, placement tests - all created to SHOUT OUT for us that we are not equal. We judge each other and wherever there is judgement there is no room for equality.
The subjectivity of the human mind deprives us of the opportunity to look at things and people with a neutral eye. People always compete with each other. No two individuals are the same: one may have better communication skills, another, better appearance, a third can be a technological master. Each one of us contributes to the whole of humanity in a certain way, adding a small piece to the puzzle, a piece that couldn't have been supplied by another person. No man or woman is big and powerful enough to see the whole puzzle at once, but only bits of it. I think the only people who have come very close to seeing what MAN is, are astronauts. Having the world in your palm compares to nothing one can feel while on earth. The clouds, the oceans the seas, the continents, the ice - one hand is big enough to encompass them all! Where is man then? He is nothing but an inconspicuous inhabitant of the planet, an occupant you are aware of but one that is rendered insignificant by the enormous limitless void. Is space really the final frontier?
Beyond the material aspect of our world is the spiritual. Another universe, beyond this final frontier that stands before man, which we could live in if it were our choice. And in that universe governs a different master. One that has created all living things and everything on earth. And once He brought all into existence He created Man. To Him, the Creator, men are equal. We are born equal before God. But is this state of equality preserved for eternity? I think not. Once we make a choice as to which way we would live, God's way or our way, this equality is erased. We fall in one of two categories: sinners, sentenced to eternity in hell, or righteous, placed in favor with God, sentenced to eternity in heaven. Again it is our uniqueness and individual will that will determine the outcome of our existence.
In my opinion, our being in its very essence is antagonistic to equality. One man judges another, saying ""I'm better than you!"". The latter judges the first, saying the same. Without the interference of a third party this conflict, so inherent to humans, cannot be resolved. Equality is a relative term invented by the more equal to keep the masses under control.

What is real? How do you define real? Is it only nerve impulses sent to the brain? How do you know whether you are dreaming or awake? Does that matter at all?
What you can achieve in your dreams is not necessarily non-accomplishable in the real world.
Did you know that in Internet was conceived as a dream? The dream to communicate from your computer at home with people at work at the office. So people started testing around - and little by little, the dream becartie reality. Today most people use Internet and rely on it for their correspondences all over the world, business communications, some people even ""live"" inside their computers because this system provides virtually everything that is found outside of it.
Another shiny example of what dreams can bring to this world is the Periodic Table of the Elements. It was in a dream that Mendeleev saw it and later on made it applicable. What would Chemistry be without that Table?! This time the dream was a sleep but as well as the dream of Vinton Cerf for the Internet network it brought human kind a step further in its thinking and evolution.
How do innovations pop up? They are part of somebody's imagination. Novelty and imagination and dreaming are like horse and carriage. You can't have the first without the second. It is the second - imagination and dreaming - that makes us human. The ability to see things that are not there yet but could be, the ability to dream of better things in life and make our dreams possible - all that drives us further into our quest for progress and perfection. Technology, science and industrialization are all based on our creative thinking. Our minds are our tools for advancement.
People have progressed tremendously over the centuries thanks to their ability to live outside of the material limits. Dreams have provided a whole New World to explore and apply to the everyday one.
Without our imagination we wouldn't be here today, at least not the way we are. We could well be primates without the gift to imagine things. Imagination helps us invariably whenever there is a problem to be solved. We could predict to an extent the different outcomes of an argument and choose the best alternative. A trait of human beings that betters each on of us and makes it possible for us to persevere in the tough world surrounding us.

The first thing that strikes in the so-formulated statement is the choice to generalize the topic.
What is meant by ""our world""? American opinion-research groups may have put it so in order to avoid a million-dollar trial for using discriminative terms, or it may just show the tactfulness of an English teacher who is already too much used to being polite. There are of course other nations that can make the fine gesture of putting all of us on the same level, but they are actually not too many. But in order to draw a clearer picture of today's world, we have to start with making some distinction.
Though we all inhabit the same planet, the Earth, most people realize that there are various levels and sub-levels. Those who don't can switch on the TV, the radio, read a newspaper and will be surprised to see terms like ""developed countries"", ""developing countries"", ""countries from the third world"" and so on. In all these countries live people as if in the same century, year, month, but actually worlds apart. The gap between them is deepening at such rate nowadays, that some are planning to spend the next Christmas on a Moon-party, while others don't know how the trees look like outside their hometown. There are countries where words like ""technology"" and ""industrialization"" can only be seen in science-fiction books.
We may also use Alvin Tofler's terms and say that few societies are nowadays part of the so- called ""third wave"", others still live in the first and second one. Industry and technology make life easier, but it doesn't mean that they take away our imagination. On the other hand agricultural societies are closer to Nature, but they are too much involved in earning their daily bread to appreciate the beauty that surrounds them.
Of course some may argue that poor people have time and room for imagination, that their chance is to compensate by dreaming for what they lack in reality. In contrast, rich people become lazy because all they may want is within their reach. Such point of view is well supported and actually very widespread. But we can focus our attention on another aspect.
Imagination and technological progress are different worlds by themselves; one is the world inside, while the other is totally external. Of course, they can affect each other according to the personal wish and good will of human beings. Without imagination nothing of the things around us would have existed. Prior to get materialized they have to be created in the mind, invented with the divine help of imagination. All creators are endowed with the ability to imagine. The trouble begins where the wish to be active stops. This is the point of inertia or otherwise laziness.
The point where inner world is confused with outer world, where one becomes like a robot in his mind and expects the machinery around him to be inventive.
The innate quality of dreaming is not something that can be taken away from us, but it is rather we who give it up and refuse to use it. As long as we are filled with eagerness, no external circumstances can stop us. There will always be place for imagination as long as people are willing to experience it. Life itself gives us much proof about that. In the most developed country, USA, meet the two extremes - the utmost activeness and creativity, and the utmost passiveness and apathy. Prosperity does not automatically mean fulfillment of desires. And as long as we have desires we will use our imagination. Lack of prosperity does not always provide us with the ability to dream. Many people may not find the soothing source of dreaming and will give up to despair. Dreaming is the inner necessity of our hearts, while technology is the outer necessity of our body.
The two worlds can meet, can affect, can support each other, but obviously one is not to compensate the other. We can use technological progress as a tool to enlarge our scope, our conscious of what is beyond and what can be achieved. And still dominance is to be given to the inner, because it is the thing no one can take from us. Nobody can stop us from dreaming, nobody can deprive us of the ability to imagine. But what to treat with priority it will be always the personal choice of every one of us.

Nowadays, a lot of people claim that there is no place for dreaming in our hectic reality dominated by computers and hi-tech electronics. However, this is not the case. People do have the opportunity to dream, only that their dreams are different. Technologies does not prevent one from having sacred wishes - they create a different world where dreams have their due place.
To begin with, the modern world is not that gloomy and especially young people have ideas of their future life that are sometimes closer to imagination than to the real state of events. They dream of love and romantic experiences even with practically perfect strangers, of adventures on desert islands, and now more that ever, youths dream of touching the stars. Children play their insane computer games imagining they have power and live in a world different from ours.
Also, more and more boys and girls use the Internet in order to make acquaintances with other people with mutual interests, or merely with people who share the same urge for the unknown. Is it not a way of dreaming? One can be whoever one wishes to, one can live, at least for some hours in another town, country, why not completely different world.
Besides, people pay much more attention to music these days. We spend a lot of money to buy an original audio record or to go to a concert of our favourite band. We do this and we will keep on doing this because, of course it is show business but not only, music is a way to escape from the suppressing reality of today. Styles like ambient, goa and psychedelic trance become more and more valued for they make one dream, cut all connections with what is thought to be the real world.
In this respect, the twenty-first century will be marked with the image of the double conscience. In other words, people will be looking for their alter ego, will be living in search of their lost half and will be aspiring for the peace of their souls more than ever before. That is why, some are attracted to Buddhism, yoga, even astrology and other untraditional philosophy and use them as a means of entering a different dimension of existence.
In short, people dream. Probably, owe to our 'made-up' reality, or probably despite it. Authors like Herman Hesse, Audous Huxley, George Orwell and many others dreamt for the lost soul of the true human being, who was lost himself in a too complex world of machines and artificial intellects. They were pioneers of the idea of the 'brave new world' which is actually a representation of our contemporary reality.
Finally, technologies do not deprive us from the opportunity to dream. What is more important, one should manage to survive in spite of them. Music, religion, books, writing poems, singing, drugs, whatever. Anything that brings you closer to the world of your dreams helps. People are not designed to be told what to think, they are free creatures who will always wait for the moment when they will see what happens on the dark side of the Moon.

BGSU1217,3.0,3.5,,,,,Most University degrees are theoretical and do not prepare us for the real life. Do you agree or disagree?,"
The conscious existence of each and every human being is connected with the process of knowing the world, with numerous attempts to make sense of different phenomena in nature, and with the constant urge to know more about the hidden secrets of the world. People who cannot 'get rid of ' their passion for the unknown usually go to university as, to some extent, it enables the students to expand their personal horizon.
In this respect, universities are a place where anyone could devote their life, or at least part of their time, to taking a degree in their favourite and most valued field. The belief that university cannot and do not prepare people for life is not necessarily true. The time spent in the university is time spent not for 'filling' your head but for 'making' it. University does not catches the fish instead of you, but it teaches you how to catch your own good haul.
Besides, university gives students the opportunity to meet people of considerable knowledge - their teachers or simply mates with mutual interests. The mere contact with them shows one a different perspective of the outer reality and a better way of explaining to oneself the reasons why things happen in this or that fashion. Hence, your own perspective and opinion of problems and questions that may eventually concern you.
Moreover, the question of finding a job is a crucial factor. If you have a degree in some field, it is more likely for you to get a certain post. Of course, it is true that there is always the possibility to stay unemployed, because of the contemporary situation. However, a person with a well-made head is always easy to adjust, not to conform with, to the requirements of his employers.
As an illustration, taking a degree in English studies - which is a quite theoretical science - not only makes you a person who can speak two or more languages. In the process of education students are given the chance to work with various texts, write their papers which prepares them for any future work connected with written speech - some of them may become interpreters, journalists, guides, others may prefer to devote their life to teaching pupils or their own students.
The point is that any degree of higher education is a step before the others, an advantage in the battle called life.
To sum up, education, especially higher education teaches people how to analyse things, to come up with suitable decisions, to make their best by using the capacity or their mind, to survive among severe competitors, and perhaps to become better individuals. Taking a university degree is a hard thing to do, but it is supposed to make one's life if not easier, at least more pleasant, as it is always a pleasure to communicate with educated people.
In conclusion, we owe a lot to the theoreticians of all times, to the people who contributed for the development of human race. Finally, 'theory' in no way means 'uselessness'. If a certain study is to some extent theoretical it is suitable for people with such understanding of the world - people who have zest to know even the unknowable. The choice is yours.

BGSU1228,3.0,3.5,,,,,"In his novel ""Animal Farm"" George Orwell wrote ""All men are equal but some are more equal than others"". How true is this today?","
The statement ""All men are equal; but some are more equal than others"" sound to me ironically and I perceive it in a sense that people are not equal at all. And (despite democracy) this is entirely true still today.
It was claimed that people were equal during the time of communism. However, men cannot be equal because they are not born equal. Everybody differs from the others and has his/her own individual features. There are more clever and less clever people, musically gifted and people who do not have musical learning at all; there are people born to be leaders and other - to be executors.
The maxim ""Men are equal"" should probably be integrated in the way that all men have equal opportunities. Let us see whether this is really true, for example, in England. I was impressed by the big class division there. Even the middle class falls into upper middle class, middle middle class and lower middle class. When I opened the book ""Modern Britain: A Short History"" By E.
Boyle, which we discussed in our classes in ""Society and Culture of Great Britain"" I learned the following: ""The differences among classes are not only in the inequalities of wealth. Even their social norms are different"". Working class social norms include such things as a fatalistic acceptance of inequality, a belief in luck, and a sense of safety through group loyalty. By contrast middle class social norms include an acceptance of hierarchy coupled with a belief the individual can and should climb it, a willingness to make long-term plans for one's children, and a trust in self-reliance. I learnt that in the 1950s and 1960s Britain experienced a sustained period of economic growth. Many people began to speak about an increase of social mobility and the establishment of a more egalitarian society. Education ensured the consolidation of the class structure though the admission of limited numbers of the lower classes into the traditional preserves of the higher. According to the author, however, these changes have taken place a slight degree. Over 80 per cent of manual workers came from manual backgrounds, and three quarters of the sons of manual workers go into manual work themselves. Similarly about two- thirds of the sons of non-manual fathers found non-manual work, that is the odds remain heavily in favour of sons finding employment in the same category as their fathers.
All these examples vividly illustrate that in England there cannot exist equality of opportunity of the people coming from different classes at all. What education you will receive and what job you will find depends strongly on your origin. In spite of numerous measures taken to increase social mobility, the movement from one class to another is more and exception than a rule.
There is another kind of inequality today - the inequality among citizens of different countries: among the citizens of highly developed countries and poorly developed ones. The opportunities for realization for any people in rich and developed countries are much bigger than in a country like ours where unemployment and poverty are widely spread. It is enough to remember the Shengen contract which clearly shows us that not absolutely all men are equal.

BGSU1229,3.5,4.0,,,,,"Some people say that in our modern world, dominated by science and technology and industrialisation, there is no longer a place for dreaming and imagination. What is your opinion?","
Inequality is one of the biggest problems which society has to solve. Ostensibly people are not divided into separate groups by the colour of their skin, their religion or sexual orientation, financial prosperity or belonging to different organizations. However, segregation still exists and continues to put people into various categories which oppose each other.
Nowadays inequality between people can be noticed very clearly in the terms of their financial stability. Some people can afford expensive clothes, cars, houses and many thinks which others cannot buy. A glaring example which I use to illustrate my viewpoint is the attendance of luxurous clubs in some countries. There the poor are not allowed to enter because all these places are reserved for extremely reach and famous persons. This fact is one of the numerous examples which show that inequality occupies its own place in society no matter how much people want to ignore its presence.
Furthermore, racial discrimination is one of the hottest issues in the world today. The United States of America, for example, is a democratic country known to have a tolerant attitude towards African-Americans. They are treated liberally and have equal chances to succeed. However, the pressing problem concerning segregation is not forgotten because it is rooted in people's minds.
People unconsciously take sides and try to influence others on various points related to this particular topic. In the same way, the attitude towards Jews is similar to the one towards coloured people. Prejudices, though not very common, exist and deteriorates the relationships between people from different origin.
Moreover, the division between people according to their sexual orientation most clearly expresses the concept of inequality. For instance, homosexuals are expelled and discarded from ""good"" society because they are different from others. These people are regarded as insignificant and treated as outlaws. In this case sexuality is a measure to define people into two groups - normal and abnormal thus segregating them.
In addition, people's physical condition may also lead to inequality. The disabled and crippled are subjected to different kinds of injustice and demanded in various ways. Their physical qualities are the reasons of the wrong attitude and mistreatment they receive.
In my opinion, George Orwell's statement "" All men are equal but some are more equal than others"" is true and totally relevant today. Unfortunately a great number of people do not consider that it is the good personality that they have to pay attention to, not same unimportant details like sexuality, material wealth, colour of skin and so on. The most significant thing for the characteristics of the particular that he or she belongs to. The whole society should try to realize this in order to avoid the problem of inequality.

Recently I attended a creative writing course. Often, when I told people about that I felt an implied criticism, a slight shrugging of shoulders: ""What is the point? What are you going to do when you 'develop your imagination'?"" It sounded impractical, an eccentricity, in a world where it would have been far more useful to attend a computer course, for example, instead. Imagination will not help you fulfil your pressing duties, it will not help you in life. ""Come back to earth"" is a popular receipt middle-aged people give for success in life. To be a dreamer has somewhat negative connotations and we all hide our dreams deep in our souls, putting on our masks of serious, purposeful people.
Walking in the streets you see hundreds of people, hurrying up and down and quickening your race you think about your duties for the day. Sometimes you feel that you are not yourself but just a little particle which has to be at 8 o'clock here and 8.30 there, etc. etc. A little particle which has its functions to fulfil and lives its little life accordingly in order to succeed in society, But in the bus to my next appointment I dream. I imagine things that can never be real, take part in events that will never come true and smile inwardly. I look at the serious faces of the other passengers. Do they dream as well. Sometimes I catch a suppressed involuntary smile or a look that goes through the objects around and I know I am not the only one. It is these moments of dreaming that seem to give us strength to go on, to cast a guilty glance at the watch and get off the bus, still inspired in your half-dream, half-reality state.
I do not believe that dreaming and imagination have no place in modern technological reality.
Saying that they are outdated is just part of the serious, purposeful mask we have to put on everyday. It seems that imagination is the opposite of practical pragmatic technology, dreaming the opposite of truth and reality related science. Yet it was the chaos of imagination that prompted the order of technological inventions and the ""nonsense"" of impractical dreamers that made scientific discoveries possible. Whatever we say about modern world, however machine-like we call it imagination and dreaming will always be and integral part of it. Because we are all human beings and involuntary smiles on our serious faces will continue to break our masks.

If we are to consider the practical application of the knowledge one has gained during one's years in university, the first think that we must consider is the career one has chosen. If this career has to do with scientific research or the profession of a teacher (no matter whether it is a school or university teacher) then the preparation universities offer might be of considerable help.
Otherwise university education does not, as a rule, make young people flexible when it comes to their professional realization.
Although university education tries to give a wither perspective in certain areas of the achievements of human thought and culture, it very often fails to provide suggestions as to how the information received may be used by the individual. In other words, students are sometimes too much preoccupied with what other people have thought or said without being given the chance to assist themselves in the complex system of human experience, although they too take an active part in a constant recycling of information. If at least a small part of what is thought at university does not coincide with a student's personal beliefs, then we come to the question whether we need university education at all.
Another aspect of university education, which sometimes terrified students very much, is suggested by the saying ""The more I learn, the less I know. In fact this really is the case when it comes to learning: there appear more and more interesting, or important things, which seem to demand close attention and sometimes students feel lost in this flow of interconnected details.
Such on abundance does have its influence on personal motivation and most often this influence is negative.
Thus we come to considering the role of the teacher which is closely related to the curriculum in terms of focus on different aspects of the disciplines thought. Although students at universities are not little children, they still may be very strongly impressed and even influenced by someone else. An important thing teachers must not forget is that students are individuals and personalities on their own and what both teachers and students should have in mind when it comes to communication is mutual respect. In my opinion, a very important thing about the process of education is the atmosphere of cooperation which is closely connected with overcoming certain difficulties (together) on the way of reaching s set goal. If teachers themselves are not convinced that what they do is what they want, or at least what should be done, then students cannot be convinced and motivated at all. Thus the years spent in university become a mere waste of tine and students are not given any idea of their own importance and potentials when it comes to intellectual achievements or just the satisfaction of a well-done job.
Actually, what makes university education of little value is not only the curriculum, but also the fact that students seldom get the right perspective of viewing the world in its complexity, no matter whether on the base of technical disciplines or the humanities.

Nowadays equality among people is one of the most important human rights and a problem as well. Formally and legally all men are equal or have the same rights, but human relations are much more complex to be all governed by laws and rights. Therefore, Orwell's words will always be true. What he says is that: man are legally equal before the court, but as individuals are very complex and thus the idea of equality might turn into an utopia.
Man is social being. He created the social structure such with all its peculiarities: laws, rights, institutions, relations, customs, classes and beliefs. Laws govern societies, but still societies differ, same laws too. For instance in some countries corruption among politicians is very common, in others it is not allowed to happen at all. So, the human right of equality exists, but it may not always be observed and there still be privileged and under-privileged people in society, or in Orwell's words ""equal"" and ""more equal"".
On the other hand, every man is unique and lives according to his own understandings of life and social principles. Some observe social rights, laws and opinions, others may prefer to challenge social order, change it or live in a different way. This is a result not only of one person's character, but has to do with the inherent human egoism. Everyone lives according to his interest and necessities. Thus the fixed social order cannot be universal and therefore exist such phenomena in society as: crime, revolts, strikes, revolutions, wars. As a result, equality turns out to be a temporary state at the best and an impossible dream at the worst.
Orwell's words contain still another implication relevant to nowadays' life, His words imply a warning for the worst, which is equality as an utopian dream. The dream of equality is the basis of communism as a political and social system, which failed in many countries and revealed much unjustice and violence that ray behind it. Finally Orwell's words can be seen as an appeal against the absurd of utopias like this.
To sum up, man may be a social being or a rational animal, but he is also a searching one. He creates, governs and structures, but he will always be driven by his will for justice, in order to live in an ideal world. Yet, as humans we are all very complex beings and ideal things among us do not exist and will not. Therefore, if some are equal, others will be more and this the way the world goes.

It is true that people nowadays are becoming more and more dependent on technology, even addicted to it. Computers have become an integral part of our everyday life - both professional and personal. However, dreaming and imagination only at first glance seem contrary to this wild technological advancement, rather they have laid the basis for it. Modernization is the product of our imagination, a dream come true. Imagination is inherent in man and it will always be part of his life, though life may change considerably.
Firstly, imagination can be found present in the modern world as being the driving force of progress in all spheres of science, technology, human relations and so on. Imagination helps people adopt to the world in the best and most efficient for them way. It is the power of creation, the will for change and a better life. Therefore, no matter what problems the surrounding poses to man, his imagination is the power which helps him pick up the challenge and make the world a better place. If imagination and dreaming cease to charge man with their power of creation and energy, then, I think, man would cease to exist as well.
Secondly, dreaming and imagination would always find their place in the individual human mind as they make up a considerable part of his inner world. Every man has the inner need to realize himself, to project himself against the reality, so that he feels fulfilled and in harmony with himself and the world. This kind of imagination and dreaming is also at the base of art. Modernization, despite its limitations cannot suppress the basic need of man to be a creator of his own world.
Moreover, modernization, as a product of man's imagination, as a dream come true, should facilitate and help our imagination to go on creating, inventing and reshaping the world around.
Finally, it seems that imagination and creation are in a reaction of perpetual interdependence and therefore if we look at technology and computerization as our creations, the way they are, in fact, then if really seems pointless to state that in a world of great technological advance there is no place for dreaming and imagination. On the contrary, imagination will always create commodities, products, things meant to facilitate life, which however inevitably will bring problems with them, which again in their own right will serve as challenge to our imagination and a stimulus to our dreaming, so that the cycle is closed. Therefore, imagination seems indispensable and will always be the driving force of human existence, both socially and individually, for each one of us, and for the whole humankind.

There is certainly very much truth in what lots of people think is the reality of modern civilization.
We are surrounded by machines and cannot even imagine our lives without our computers and various technical equipment. Yet, I think it is a rather controversial question as there are great number of things that can stimulate our imagination. In my opinion there is still place for dreaming and imagination.
First of all, I would like to start with the computers. We have them all around us and are indispensable in our day-to-day work. What is more, we may even make friends through the Internet, chat with people all over the world, experience virtual visiting to charming places all around the globe. In a nutshell, we may spend the whole of our lives in front of the computer and we will not miss anything. Even the children nowadays spend much more time in front of the TV, watching videos or playing computer games than on the playground. But can we prevent this when the playgrounds have turned into car parks because in our modern world the car is also an indispensable part of our lives?
I would say that computers set out minds free. For example, we pretend to be somebody else, an imaginative hero of your own story who has no other way out of your consciousness. Besides, instead of chasing each other or pretending to be fathers ad mothers, children nowadays become engrossed in computer games in which they rescue princesses, dream to be superman or imagine they are pilots.
Another thing worth mentioning is the fact that we have machines for everything - we are surrounded by ""robots"" that do everything we do - wash our dishes, wash our clothes. Moreover, there are devices that even remember things for us - telephone number, friends' birthdays and so on. The point is that modern technologies have developed considerably and it is the questions today science poses in front of our minds that stimulate our imagination. Nowadays we have no easy answers and it is left to our imagination to figure out how the other living forms in space look like, how the other planets look like, what it would be to fly in space and so on.
To conclude with, I would say that there is and there will always be place for our imagination because we are human beings.
What is more, science technologies develop because they are first part of our dreams and then become reality.

The end of the twentieth century, let alone the twenty first, is the wrong time to live for people of imagination, people of heart, those of 'aristocratic' mind. In the last few decades industry and technology have conquered our world, leaving small place for those who find themselves incapable of sitting all day in front of the computer, being secretaries or bankers, selling goods or trading. I am one of those people. I like reading, studying foreign languages, discussing philosophy; I am the introvert type. I can't see myself doing the accounts of some company or advertising some new stupid and useless kind of product, like some sports device for reaching the perfect body-measures.
I tremble at the thought that some time in near future I may have to buy goods through computer programes. If things continue in the same direction as now, I will soon forget eye-to-eye communication and talk with friends on Internet. (But we can solve and problem, some computer experts would say. We can make so that you can see each other). No, thanks, I prefer to take the pains to go to their house.
I hear, we would be able to make virtual love or even reproduce thanks to the efforts of science and technology. This would be a wonderful and very meaningful experience, without any doubt.
But, yes, of course, we could even live forever, avoid getting old. The way I see it, we will turn into dolls, some artificial beings. If comes the bright news of the most recent effort of science - we could be cloned. Anyway, I prefer making love in the natural way and having wrinkles when I grow older.
In the current state of affairs I don't know what kind of job I can get. Of a secretary may be, if I learn to operate on a computer, of course.
Since people get more and more involved in computers I don't know who's going to write and read poetry and fiction. Probably people just won't have time to go for a walk with friends and talk about small, simple things. Business is what matters now.
While technology seems to spare us time, at the same time, it somehow tends to obsess us, not leaving us time for natural things like a walk in the park or going to a concert. (Some people go even there with their mobile phones). Dreaming, of course, is considered stupid nowadays, a waste of time. I must admit that technological progress has its good sides too - for example I can listen to my favourite artists on the recorder or watch some interesting programme of TV, see a good film. Yet, I think the list of the disadvantages is longer.
Perhaps, some compromise could be reached if people become more careful about in which field technology should dominate and from which it should be excluded. All I know is that man doesn't need the machine in order to be happy - we have air, food and water without the machines.

The question of equal opportunities for all has been very topical over the last few decades in the West, and the problem is beginning to gain momentum in our own country nowadays. Yet, it is interesting to note that the movement started in the USA as a backlash against the century-long oppression of the blacks. Which leads one to certain speculations - whether it is possible at all for everyone to have equal opportunities or this is just the next product of American hypocrisy and utopian thinking. In my humble opinion, the latter is the case - because people are not born equal and they are not raised in the same way, the result being that everyone is unique, and different from all the rest. And if equal opportunity be given to everyone, that would mean propping up the less competent and restricting the more able.
If we start from the very beginning and go as far back as birth, it would perhaps be less obvious that people are unique. And yet, however alike babies might look, they are never the same. As crude as it may sound, their genetic material is different, and that's a major part of who you are.
After all, your genes predetermine most of your future ""parameters"" such as potential looks, potential IQ, potential health and what not.
Then, who you become very much depends on your parents and the choices they make - who they are and what connections they have, how they bring you up and what opportunities they give you in terms of social environment, schooling, health care and so on. As a result, even identical twins are not the same person although they have the same genes. The uniqueness of everyone is not a racist or Faschist idea as some claim, it is a fact. And it stands to reason that you don't provide the same opportunities to people with different abilities. Race and nationality would seem to be excluded from the list, at least it would be logical, but experience show a different thing.
While it is only sensible to discriminate against people who are incompetent - because if you need an employee or a partner in business then they have to be the right person and quality for the position - it is only a prejudice to discriminate against people, or groups of people as it might be, on the basis of race or nationality. And however illogical this is, we know that the West, and the States in particular do that all the time, although they wouldn't admit it openly.
It seems to me that the most striking example of this is what happens in the admission offices of their colleges - though very few would actually say so, most of them have quotas for racial groups and for international students. Then, there are special scholar-ships awarded to minority groups - and that's discrimination as obvious as anything, only this time it is against the white people. And there's thousands things like this, official and everything, although contrary to the general appeal for equal opportunities.
So I would ask these American gentlemen if they would please keep their hypocrisy to themselves. I'd give discrimination the thumbs up, but only as long as it is based on sensible criteria, that are actually relevant, and not on things like I'm black, you are white. I'm tall and you're short, I'm American and you're a Pole. These are a part of who we are, but it's important that we order our priorities and judge people on the relevant points.

""Equality"" is a widespread word used by all people from parents to politicians. At the same time it denotes problems because it is used to delude people. The word has been overexploited and some witty people try to avoid it or give it slightly different meanings. Generally speaking when one person is equal to another, it means that they are treated as if they have the same rights and are given the same attention or attitude. But in my opinion equality is too perfectly utopian to be true. People have never been, are not and never will be equal. There are privileged ones which seem to be more equal than other.
First of all I would like to mention equality or rather inequality in the family. Usually the mother, and sometimes the father, choose one of the children and spoil it. It is their favourite girl/boy, more ""equal"" than the other, and the favourite child is permitted more things, it is less likely that it will be punished for being mischiveous.
Another aspect of family inequality is the domination of one member of the family. It is usually the man - father and husband - who expects his wife and children and obey him. Even though in rare occasions the wife or one of the grown-up children takes control over family matters . It is not fair to be more equal, ""to rule"" when at the wedding the pledge couples give equality.
What I describe as inequality in the family repeats school. School is the boundary between family and the world outside, between childhood and adulthood. Teachers usually claim that they treat children equally but they like the students interested in the subjects they teach more than the disinterested or the lazy ones. The more equal are paid special attention and the rest of the class hate them. This inequality breeds aggression and at an early age it creates serious problems which cannot easily be overcome. From experience I know that it is true of every school and every class/group. This inequality is partly justified when it is based on knowledge and unforgivable when based on friendship, family relations and so on. Teachers have to consider their position as representatives of the responsible adult's world.
Beyond the boundary where everybody becomes really respectable for him-/herself things are different and similar at the same time. On entering society young people stop being pawns and become more active. They meet other people, look for jobs, vote and are not under so close supervision.
Hoewver, while looking for a job, when applying, women may find out that it is rather men who get the jobs. It depends on the profession, if any, of the person but discrimination exists. More equal tend to be not only men. White people compared to black people, someone who has never been in prison compared to a former prisoner ... Here the list of examples is endless and all of the time someone assures you that you are equal to other people, that we all have equal rights.
Usually it is the voices of politicians who say it out loud. People most of the time do not believe them and doubt if their vote for certain politicians has been of some importance or some politicians were more equal than other. Having in mind this disbelief, they cannot believe in the genuiness of anything the say no matter whether it is about equal rights or positions. And equality is so subjective that it gives everybody the chance to grade it according to his/her conceptions, especially old people who almost always argue about politics. For them there are more and less equal people.
But for me equality and all its derivatives should not be mentioned too often. They make people suspicious and really breed disbelief or just make people rebel against inequality because that is all they see. Equality as an utopian idea is good in itself and we should aspire to it because, after all, one of human aims is to attain the unachievable perfection.

BGSU1245,3.5,3.0,,,,,"Some people say that in our modern world, dominated by science and technology and industrialisation, there is no longer a place for dreaming and imagination. What is your opinion?","
Dreaming and imagination has always been inherent to human nature. These are concepts that not only the Romantic poets were preoccupied with but many scholars and students that had nothing to do with the ephemeral essence of art. People usually don't pay attention to the different aspects and meanings of dreaming and imagination. Besides being regarded as something different from science, technology and industrialization, they have proved to be part of them, moving forward in time the human race.
It is very important that dreaming and imagination go hand in hand with technological developments in the path leading to future inventions. People think that the two are incompatible, they have to brouse through certain fiction written at the end of the 19th and the beginning of the 20th centuries. They will see that there are a lot of things which were the fruit of the author's imagination and then became something real, something that we could touch and use, something that in the course of the 20th century ceased to strike us as unusual and innovative. As example is H. G. Well's ""A Man on the Moon"". The whole idea of being there with all the equipment and outfit seemed fictional at the time he wrote the book. He was definitely using his imagination to create everything. But time passed and it came true. Science and technology have a role to play here, not only imagination.
Dreaming and imagination are used to set some goal, something that the same person or another person years later will strive to achieve. This must have been the case with the Crystal Palace, for example. It was probably conceived as a dream palace, something unachievable, perfect and desirable. But then man began to look for the ways to build it and had to consider even the techniques to make the identical panels of glass. It seems to be a long process involving the use of creative energy for the purposes of progress. I believe that this is exactly the way in which most human minds work. Thus their imagination may be called practical.
I do not deny the existence of the other type of imagination that is usually reflected in poetry but it is the kind of dreaming that is inaccessible to most people. A person who is sitting and dreaming of inventing some device that will help him at work or is dreaming about the Gardens of Eden, this person will probably never understand ""Kubla Khan"" - the product of another person's imagination but he might be declared a self-taught genius when he invents the thing he is dreaming about. And then everybody will think about the way it all started with the person sitting alone in his room and probably watching out of the window seeing anything because he was actually dreaming.
Dreams and imagination are something that brings us pleasure but it may also bring success and money. Then why keep our dreams to ourselves? If they are not too personal, there is a chance that they will be useful for other people as well. However, all the time we have to be careful not to come up with a product of our dreams that will be nothing new. There is a comedy where a child asks his father for a topic of a science-fiction essay and the father's suggestion is a car that has no wheels and floats in the air. The child simply reminds him that it has been long since all sorts of aircraft were invented.
Besides being funny, this scene from a film is a good conclusion because it shows the dangers of dreaming and at the same time it points to the intersection of technology and imagination, which is shared with us by some people - science fiction. It might be perceived as the future at present.
And the future in all probability will continue to combine technology and imagination.

The world we live in is a world of civilization, modernization and science technology.
Technological devices are inevitably present in our every-day lives and we simply take them for granted. Still, there is a potential threat that the predominant role technology plays in our society may eventually exert a negative impact on humans, since they may turn into automatized robots with no feelings and imagination left.
To begin with, our modern world is dominated by all sorts of science-and-technology inventions which have ruled our life for such a long time that we hardly notice them any more. Instead, we simple take them for granted and cannot imagine our existence without them. This concerns the labour-saving devices which are an obligatory component of each household, as well as the whole range of technological apparatuses we use everyday at work and at home like the telephone, the TV set, the radio, the cassette and video recorders. Finally, this regards the culmination of human-technological genius - the computer which becomes more and more widely-used by millions of people. Of course, all these technological devices have facilitated our life and made it easier and more comfortable. That is why they have a great significance for the development of modern civilization.
However, overusing these technological apparatuses exerts a rather negative impact on humans and on children and young people in the most. If they work with the computer, for example. A
long time without a break they put their physical and psychological health in serious danger.
Moreover, their emotional and social well-being is negatively affected as well because they spend little time with people their age and have little chance to develop their communicative abilities. On the whole, nowadays technology has preoccupied our lives to such a great extent that we hardly communicate with other human beings, using the traditional means for this like a hand-written letter or discussing in private our problems with our family or friends. We instead use the telephone or the computer to communicate with people from different countries on the Internet or the Chat channel.
However, what is most important is that in our modern world there is a very little place for emotions, dreams and imagination. We are preoccupied with technology and the pursuit of money and career and ignore the most significant - the fact that all the technological devices cannot replace the contact with a normal human being.
To sum up, we cannot give up all technological devices we are so used to living with because they make our life easy and comfortable. However, in our modern and civilized world we should not forget we are human beings after all and need take love and affection only a gentle and loveable human heart can give us.

BGSU1251,4.0,3.0,,,,,"In his novel ""Animal Farm"" George Orwell wrote ""All men are equal but some are more equal than others"". How true is this today?","
From historical point of view the term 'equality' is most thoroughly dealt with in the period of the French revolution. At that time were introduced three essential key words which had to do with basic human rights - liberty, equality, fraternity. It was mostly from then that not only philosophers, scholars and politicians but plain folk as well started taking a great interest in things like liberty, independence and equality in political, economic, social and cultural terms.
Accordingly, it is generally accepted that although we are equal by birth, some of us can claim themselves (whether they are right or wrong) more equal than others (that is, superior to hem) on account of their personal characteristics, social status and prosperity in life.
To begin with, a number of people are in their right to consider themselves more equal than others, as regards their personal features of the character like good nature and unselfishness, perseverance and ambition, readiness to work hard and self-sacrificingly. Thanks to these characteristics of theirs, such people often get on in life in both professional and personal respects. Moreover, they are usually respected by others because they are self-made and have prospered in life on their own. That is why it is the general opinion that people of this kind are more equal and deservable than others in terms of respectability, honour and dignity.
In addition, lots of people have a prosperious life not dues to hard work but to good luck only. In other word they achieve their goals with the minimum of effort and are simply born lucky.
Moreover, they succeed in each initiative of theirs and have to cope with no significant problems and obstacles. That is why in terms of a fortunate destiny, they are mostly deservable of quality than everybody else because good luck is always by their side.
Furthermore, there is still an another category of people who regard themselves most equal of all, that is, in fact, they consider themselves superior then the others in terms of their wealth, national and social prestige and education. When it comes to equality, such people would ardently xxx political, economic and social rights, taken for granted by them. According to them, their money and high position in society should go together with social respect and meeting their demands in the first place and after no paying attention to less equal people (those with a lower social status).
In other words, humans with a superior origin are usually conceited, presumptuous and regard the people with a middle and low class family background as inferior and incapable of leading a life of full value. Of course, this is a rather extreme point of view which often does not reflect reality. That is, there are many cases when people from poor countries, small villages and low classes are more intelligent, hard-working and good natured then these of the top of the political, economic and social hierarchy.
To conclude, equality is quite a broad concept which includes a variety of characteristics in political, economic and cultural respects. It is rather difficult to define it and to say which people, respectively, members of a political or social group are more equal than others and deserve more respect and recognition. Moreover, the human equality has been a long and difficult process which has to an end so far. Whether it is and educated and wealthy descendant of an aristocratic family or a poor self-made man from a third-world country, All men are equal....736 w both of them have one crucial thing in common - they are people who are at least in biological, if not in any other aspect, equal and that is why there is no need to talk about 'more' and 'less' equal people but simply about people.

BGSU1255,3.0,2.5,,,,,"In his novel ""Animal Farm"" George Orwell wrote ""All men are equal but some are more equal than others"". How true is this today?","
It is this particular quotation from G. Orwell's brilliantly sarcastic fable that sounds, perhaps, more topical than ever in our times. Times in which it is very difficult to ignore the hype surrounding the world ""equality"".
Above all, I think that it is quite state to say that the whole world we live in is built on the principle of unequality. Ever since people have divided and struggled for significance. Namely this aspect of human nature has modeled the material and social surroundings by spinning the complex web of overlaping national, social, racial, gender, etc. reasons for unequality.
Considering this it becomes quite clear that the proclamation of equality is merely utopic and can be no better than a device for seizing a political or other power. Today's politicians give us enough evidence to aubstantiate this argument we became dumb witnesses to how they use their socialist (or communist, or whatever) ideologies to gain political support, then make a mockery of it and finally reinduce its power in nothing but means of political control - control based exclusively on drawing lines of importance and ability between people. The specific example that comes to my mind is intertextually connected with G. Orwell's words - it's a joke invented to mock the Apartheid.
A bus of people of all shades of colour travels through the desert in South Africa. Suddenly it breaks down and somebody has to go down in the sun and push it manually in motion until the engine starts again. There is a great fus about which group of people to do the job. The white say they are superior and can't do this, the negroes argue that they also have rights and this is racial segregation. Gradually the but driver got side of all this and shouted: ""there is no such thing as racial segregation in this country. Everybody is equal, you are all green! But we can't be stuck here all day, so please the dark-green ones go down and push the bus.
The moral of this story is that no matter what we speak, no matter in what country we live, no matter what they tell us there always be someone who calls the show and everybody else are merely spectators.
As the 20th century has come to its close we seem more and more infected with the enthusiasm of a second chance, a new beginning and we tend to redeem and improve ourselves by pondering over our past and making Christmas wishes and New Year's (Milleniums') resolutions.
In this view the statement above perfectly fits in the confines of a wish, and a warm and good wish it is, but we all know that the game is fixed and the poor stay poor and the rich get rich.
""Thou shalt get what Thou deserve"" - sounds pretty much like an except from the Ten Commandments and has also the same value - a piece of universal truth that noone wouldn't dare to question because everybody believes in the deeply inside, but also an universal xxxxx. It is quite dear thet it will never be lost because reminiscences from it will always sway above the flux of our moral principles. After all, the place of such xxx is right there - in the reference corner of our touchstones, they have no place in real life. Real life is gray - it is the breaking point of black and white ideas, views and interests of every member of the society. And exactly real life is the debris of the capital and finance and money. The principle is very simple - you give yourself out for money and somebody buys a piece of yourself again for money - and those that have invented and stand for this system receive the interest from the transaction.
I believe that the issue that is raised here could keep a whole philosophy seminar occupied till the end of the winter, but the simple truth is that nobody can ever get what he deserves he can only believe that he does and that us enough for a happy living. So dear Sirs or Madams don't get lost into the study of Turtles and better believe, because you can never get the best of both worlds.

BGSU1257,3.0,,,,,,Most University degrees are theoretical and do not prepare us for the real life. Do you agree or disagree?,"
This is a very radical statement. Generalizations of this kind always prove to be wrong although they might be true to some extent.
Yes, some university courses are highly theoretical and they offer students little practical knowledge but ""most"" is too strong a word if we want to speak of their number. There are some specialties such as ""Cultural studies"" or ""History"" which can hardly be called anything else but ""theoretical"" because such are their subject matter. However, student's who have chosen one of these two courses on purpose are in most cases aware of the fact that later they will probably have to devote their time and efforts to scientific work and researches, if of course, they want to stick to their professions. But these two examples are, to my mind, exceptions from the general rule.
Of course, every teacher, who wants to provide students with knowledge they can later use in real life, tries to make his/her course as practical as possible. This is, I think, the main purpose of the whole educational process. Because what else do university courses and degreed represent, but a preparation for real life, for having a profession and finding one's own place in society?
This leads to a simple conclusion: every course has to be carefully organized, so that it can provide students with practical, useful knowledge, not omitting, of course, the theoretical grounds for it. Every university should hire well-prepared teachers able to convey their knowledge to students in the best way; teachers who keep up with the newest inventions and changes in their professional area, and who can eventually prepare young people for the real world.
If all of this is present the only thing that seems to be left is that one chooses the proper specialty for them, which could later develop into the profession that best corresponds to their individual talents and interests.
However, even if we get the degree we want, we never know what is going to happen next. The real world is always ready to confront us with unexpected problems. And here in Bulgaria this is truly valid. Even if you have chosen the right profession for you, you might not be able to practice it, because of all the conditions. So we have to have a strong desire and try hard. And the university degrees are really valuable in this context, because they can help us get closer to finding our own places in society and realizing who we really are as individuals and personalities; as my father puts it: ""What you do is what you are"".

Imagine yourself not taking an university degree. What will your future be like? Working as a shop assistant, a taxi driver or ...? I wonder if this will make you feel satisfied.
So what? As it turns out, you're left with very little choice indeed? That is why you go to university, spend another four or five years of your life there - and then you are ready to come face to face with life that crushes and smashes. For most people nowadays tend to look on university degrees as the stepping-stone to success. What you study is not so important. Nor what you get. What matters in this case is the diploma - the precious leaflet that is believed to be the key of many locked doors. Is it really so?
Reality tells a different story. During the years one spend at the University, one really learns a lot.
It is true that most of the time you've got the feeling that your head is constantly being filled up with heaps of useless information. It is also true that you spend many a sleepless night in desperate attempts to somehow absorb all this stuff - to cram it into your brain just for the sake of the exam, and the moment the exam is over, forget all about it. This is definitely a crack in the system, you must confess. It would undoubtedly be better of students were somehow made to study throughout the year - not just at the end of it, when session begins to haunt their dreams.
But such changes are a matter of years.
And here comes the question: what dos the university give you and what does it take? No doubt it takes a lot - maybe more that it gives. Your free time, your freedom and carelessness. And in a way it robs you of your previous self. Slowly but inexorably you change. You grow up to take responsibilities, to realize who you are, what you want from life and how to achieve it. And this is not little at all. It is not only due to the university, it is up to you above all. But it can not be denied that the university too is a major factor in this process of self-development.
As far the theoretical side - well, it is always there. And perhaps it will always be. And still you can really learn a lot from a single exam only - provided you know what to take and how to take it. What is more important is that during all these years of studying, taking exams and so on - you become mature - and ready to face life. The real life.

All men are equal - that is a law of nature. Everyone, when was born. Was given the some rights, the same power and the liberty to live in one and the same world. Every person id free to live his life according to his conceptions of human values and ideals that is the natural reason that makes people believe in equality.
But throughout the history of the world things have changed a lot, and now it's difficult to say that all men have equal opportunities or equal treatment. It is a result of the revolution of the human nature as a whole. People have changed their way of thinking, their standards and principles.
It's true that people come on this world equal of each other as far as human rights are concerned.
Every living person as a representative of the human race has general characteristics, which are shared by everyone. Equality is justified mostly in the freedom all men have. It means that everyone is free to determine his life and to make his best to live in the most rational and practicable way, to achieve his aims and to fulfill his dreams.
But even in this aspect we can't speak of an absolute equality. The racial discrimination, for example, proves the statement that ""some people are more equal than others"", it means that some people have more rights and could even deprive the other of their own human rights.
As we all know, black people in the past were treated in the most degrading and severe way.
They had neither rights, nor the ability to live in freedom. They used to be sold in slavery and a white man would own their bodies, skills, even their souls, as if they were goods. These people didn't even possess the right to live in freedom/ is this equality? No, of course, it's not and moreover it's horrible and distressing. This happened centuries ago, but today racial or sex discrimination are not unfamiliar to us. That's and excellent example, showing that the colour of the skin or the sex can determine one's skills, rights and even one's fate.
This inequality is unjust and unethical but unfortunately it's natural in one world of evil and immortality where everyone wants to be ahead of the rest. Today we live in a world of crime, disorder and sins. People have become selfish and greedy for money.
The world that surround us has turn into a material one, in which money and wealth are the values that everyone pursues. It's a tragedy that money makes people crafty and unscrupulous.
They're greedy for more and more and some of them get much richer than the others, due to their tricks. So we can hardly say today that all people are equal and it's true that 'some are more equal than others', because they're divided mainly into two classes - the rich and the poor. The pity is that the money is the guiding force in our lives nowadays. This world of corruption and lawbreaking makes the rich take everything they could buy anything with money, even health and happiness. While all the virtues in human nature - goodness, purity, morality have lost their strength.
It is strongly believed that many people who are rich are more equal than the others, who are left behind, striving for a normal life.
We shouldn't blame the world we live in for this anomaly. In fact we are the ones to rule this world and make it better.
Equality is the cure for our world. People must alter their nature and be humane, compassionate and good towards each other.

There has always been dreaming and imagination, and there always will be, as long as there are human beings. In this world of computer science and technology those wonderful experiences of the soul haven't disappeared, they have just experienced a little transformation, and have just adapted themselves to the new way of living.
Today we spend part of our time in front of our PC or T.V., but this doesn't mean we cannot experience love, or lust, while typing on our computer or watching the soap-opera. In the Web we can join a chat-session, or just switch on our webcam and meet people from all around the world - people, we hardly know. We'll talk, send e-cards with roses and kisses, say hundreds of times 'I love you' to somebody we've met the other day. We manage to do this with the help of out Internet provider ... and of course our imagination and dreaming. We make up the details we don't know about the other person out there (in Paris, in Rome, anywhere and thus with the help of our imagination we build up a complete character - the object of our attraction. It is very easy and simple. It's also curious to know that when we aren't in front of our monitor typing sweet words to our 'beloved' we are dreaming of him. Although it may sound strange I know many people who have met their boyfriend/girlfriend (wife/husband) through the Internet. Thus, technology proves itself to be not a drawback in our emotional lives, but a way out of the state of estrangement.
The world of novels and breath-taking love poems seems to give way to the new world, but that is not quite so. Novels, work of art, plays - all that is available in e-texts. Of course the feeling of sitting in an armchair with your favourite book cannot be compared to reading it from the PC- screen in ""Timok"", ""Times New Roman"" or ""Hebar"" . But still the problem isn't that big. (You can just buy a laptop and sit anywhere you feel like.)
It seems to me that the W.W.W. makes it even easier when we want to read something not so well-known from a certain author. We can find anything in the Net. People need to be happy with the life technology has offered us and not try to blame it for their monotonous existence.
To round it up, it is not industrialization and technology that makes us forget our emotions, dreaming and imagination, it is us. We are just trying to find a scapegoat. We can benefit a lot more than lose from our contact with the new age around us. We should keep up a pace with the developments and innovations in our world.

Equality of people has always been a widely discussed issue throughout history. Different nations have been dealing with the question: 'Are men equal?' and if so why there are people who have more privileges than others. the topic of the two worlds - the Rich and the Poor - has become a major point in cultural, political and historical discussions. J. Orwell's statement is one of the many answers to the latter question. It gives as opinion, which can be considered partly true and partly wrong. The quotation from ""Animal Farm"" gives us a quite realistic point that could be considered true today, but still we shouldn't agree completely with it.
'Men are equal' - we have heard this so many times...
but if so, why there are much richer and much more powerful people that others. first, we should pinpoint what exactly is meant by 'equal' - is it biological, psychological, financial equality? In the quotation the first word 'equal' stands for biological and psychological equality, while the second for finance, status, society.
To make this point clearer we should view, for example, 'The Declaration of Independence'.
Though this document openly defends equality, we should not forget that there were slaves at the time. So, 'equal' concerns only the white people, those that are more 'cultural', more educated, coming from 'better societies'.
Today, things haven't undergone substantial and dramatic changes. We still talk about equality, equal rights but segregation is still common in the present day society. It comes out that people are equal only if they belong to a respected class, only if they are educated to a certain degree ...
will it be possible to say ""the governor and the pagan are equal"" in our developed society?
It somehow sounds too weird and out-of-realism a statement, too idealistic and hard to accept.
The governer himself will most probably be insulted and the pagan would answer: ""No why!"" But id we say that the governer and the MPs are equal, then it will not sound strange at all. The word 'equality' has changed so much that in most cases we do not mean that we are all humans, but we are more involved in the idea of class, financial status, education, social development and living standard. From that point it is hard to say that to people from different classes are equal...
well, they should be considered to be so, but experience shows that in most cases it is not.
It has always been hard to make all people equal, attempts have been made but all of them unsuccessful and destined to a failure. Different regimes of government have tried to solve the 'problem' of inequality, but somehow this scheme is unnatural and it cannot possibly work properly. There should always be 'the governed' and 'the governing' so that society is in flux. We can never possibly get the best of both worlds.

The Constitution of the United States says that all men were born equal. I guess all constitutions say that. But on further thinking there is not a living man who will acknowledge such fact as true.
People have different starts in life. This statement sounds more believable, I guess. So that the first statement should go "" All men were born equal but they have different starts in life"".
Man are not equal with women. They function differently: think differently, feel differently, act in a real different way. But can you tell the difference between two babies of the same sex? Yes, you can. One will be smarter than the other and it'll be much more easier for him to solve math problems when he grows up. What will the other think then? Not in the least that he's equal but rather inferior to the first grown-up baby.
But what if the second kid gets born in a rich family. Here we've got a quite different start again if the 1st baby bets born in a poor family. So now we have two babies - one rich and stupid and one smart and poor. This sounds to have been taken out of some fairytale plot but actually it might happen. Wonder who'll be happier in life? How about the disabled people? Would you think they are equal with the healthy? Maybe in a ideal world but we are not living in a such. Just think of the horrible situation of the disabled in Bulgaria. Starving, poor, friendless, helpless. There's no point on which to compare them with the fit.
Actually there are so many examples of inequality at different levels that have triggered and been the reason for thousand conflicts. Think of the hundreds history books written on that matter, books of rebellions, wars, social changes, revolutions, all started because of some difference between people.
But there is one point according to which all men could be more or less considered equal. Few are those who were blissfully happy in their lives. No matter who one lives he always envies the other people. And that proves that happiness and contentment has nothing to do with what we are or have. So we are equal in our wishes to be happy. And happiness is a dream that doesn't belong to a real world, so that it could never be fully achieved by anyone.

Though it may sound strange to many people I can't agree with this statement. Because, in the first place, if you are a dreamer or you are endowed with a extremely vivid imagination there is no power, force or authority on earth which can penetrate into your mind, block your creativity and prevent you from dreaming. Moreover, the phrase 'there is no longer place for dreaming and imagination' seems a little bit absurd to me because I am convinced that there has always been and there will always be some place for these because in my humble opinion, it were these human gifts, abilities that allowed our world to develop. They are, so to say, the driving force of humanity. Just imagine if there was no such thing like dreaming or imagination, undoubtedly, there would be no scientists, inventors, thinkers. We all would just stick to the routine and our lives would be grey, monotonous, repetitive. Nothing new would happen. There would be no evolution, no development, no progress. Everything would turn round a closed circle whose inhabitants would rather resemble some kind of electric toys with one and the same mechanical movements.
And following this kind of thinking I should say that those science technology and industrialization which are mentioned in the title of my essay would have never existed had it not been for these precious human gifts already mentioned.
And why the belief that if one is surrounded by huge grey machines in a factory, for example, he or she is deprived of the ability to dream or imagine, and not in favour of it. Just the opposite. I
can't see why people say that there is nothing inspiring in those machines. I am sure there is. If we don't see them just like booming iron giants but look at them from a different perspective. We could, for example. Imagine that they are like us: human, with souls, hearts, brains. We could imagine that they can feel, think and even suffer. Then we might write a poem or compose a song for them, who knows. They might have a wonderful effect on us but we won't know that until we try.
Finally, I want to highlight a point which may in a way divert from what I said before. I am referring to the current situation in Bulgaria. You will probably agree with me that in the past few years science technology and industrialization are not the most suitable words for the description of what surrounds us. All we are left with are just ruins. We destroyed everything we possessed. So following the logic of the heading statement there is plenty of place for dreaming and imagination.
Make sure you make the most of it.

This statement, undoubtedly, holds for almost every period of human history, and here I feel obliged to mention that there are some people who would certainly drop the word 'almost"". The world is structured in such a way that the existence of some kind of hierarchy is, unfortunately, inevitable. And it seems as if the human mind is meant to accept the existing inequality even to take it for granted.
Another doubtless fact is that there have always been people who want to be superior, to be the leaders, to have something that their neighbour, for instance, doesn't have (here I refer mostly to the material side of the matter). But, as it usually happens in life, the coin has two sides and on the other side of the coin we find the spiritual things such as intelligence, morality, physical or mental ability, talent and all kinds of virtues. There are some cases, however, when we find a combination of the two.
As I have already pointed out, the need for superiority, for competing with others in obtaining material possessions is somewhat innate in people. It seems as if one always aims at a higher step on the social ladder and, more often than not, they consider the fact that the step they are standing on is a bit higher than that of their neighbour extremely important. An excellent example for such social inequality can be found in Britain. This country is definitely notorious for its class system which, generally accepted, divides people in three large groups - the aristocracy, the bourgeoisie and the working class. In this particular case the 'spiritual"" (as I prefer to call it) side of a matter is intertwined concerning the aristocracy which nowadays is considered socially superior not because of its property or possessions but rather because of its high and respected status which is based on the historic role in the past - this great past on which the Britons look back with such a nostalgia. In the other two cases, however, the material factor is predominant: the bourgeoisie has enough while the working classes don't and it is money in fact which predetermines their whole way of living. I remember someone saying ""the English spirit is to want inferiors"" and obviously British people don't bother to suppress their inner instincts.
On the other hand, inequality between people exists on the basis of different spiritual achievements. For example, we can't say that a university teacher and a plumber are equal although their salaries proably are. Here we already come to the division according to status and authority. But as we are brought up not to mind any sort of discrimination which is not connected with money we (with few exceptions, of course, among which I place myself as well) hardly pay any attention to this kind of inequality and consider the first one more important.
Finally, I want to make it clear that, no matter how sad it is, inequality exists and I for one don't see any way exterminate it, at least in the foreseeable future. Maybe it is an indivisible part of our world and the only reasonable thing we could do is to reconcile with it. Maybe it is inequality that brought the world's progress, the world's evolution - we mustn't forget that Darwin's theory of the survival of the fittest in fact exactly the idea of inequality lies. And as it appears inequality is some kind of driving force, a guiding light in our lives, therefore I should say in conclusion that maybe the most obvious solution to our problem is to aim higher ad higher no matter on which ladder.
But who knows? Here I feel tempted to use one of my favourite quotations: ""the truth is out there"", I hope we are the people to find it.

Feeling very sleepy I desperately needed a cup of coffee. However, when I tried to ask for one I found myself completely incapable of finding the proper way to do it. In fact, I was so much worried about grammar, syntax, and the like that the only thing that I could utter was, ""Excuse me, sir, could you, please, give me a cup of coffee?"". Totally amazed, the barattender asked me: ""... a cup of coffee, rights?"". Only then did it occur to me that these, actually, were the words I was trying to find, so simple, still, so hard to think of.
Ever since this event I have been trying to find out why does it happen, so often, that knowledge acquired at the university is difficult to be applied in practice. In fact, I have reached the conclusion that if an university education is to be very good enough to prepare students for the real world, it should put theory and practice on an equal footing.
Unfortunately, it happens, quite often, that at university students are ""stuffed"" with information but are given little or no practice at all. It seems that, at lectures, is given data which is indeed valuable but which is hard to be applied in actual fact because, usually, it deals with ideal patterns. At university, practice is connected with seminars. However, at seminars what students actually do is mechanically apply models given to them at lectures, to different exercises. So, it turns out that even at seminars students deal with notional matters which are not very much connected with reality, in which almost everything is an exception to the rule.
Actually, one solution to this problem is that students be given the opportunity to be involved in the work of practicing specialist in the respective field. For example, students of medicine should be given the chance to participate in the work of the doctors and those who study law in the work of the lawyers.
Unfortunately, usually because of financial problems, it is impossible for most universities at least in Bulgaria, to regularly provide such a practice for all their students. For example, very few students of foreign languages are given the opportunity to visit or study in the country which language they learn. In fact, such an experience can be most helpful in developing linguistic skills. Some universities cannot even afford to have a native speaker to teach their students, which is rather a disadvantage as far as learning foreign languages is concerned.
However, the education of Bulgarian universities has also its advantages. For example, it cannot be denied that Bulgarian universities provide their students with detailed and valuable information, contrary to some foreign universities which offer a lot if practice but little theory.
Actually, it should be pointed out that only practice and little or no theory at all, cannot also make an education a good one; theory is the raw material without which nothing can be done, just like one cannot cook without the needed products.
It is true that linguistic sciences such as stylistics, semantics, syntax are too theoretically introduced to students (at least in Bulgaria) and that is why they are very difficult to be understand, let alone, be applied in practice. However, such disciplines carry the core meaning, the basis of the language. So, without having a closer look on them, one cannot get a deeper understanding of the language one studies. And if a student of a foreign language wants to be a good specialist s/he has to be well-acquainted not only with the surface but with the deep structure of the language as well.
So, every science no matter how theoretical and non-related to reality may seem, contributes to the development of one's skills and in that way helps in preparing one to the real world.
Literature, for example, no matter how abstract a subject may seem is, actually, of great importance for the development of the individual himself. The study of literature broadens one's horizon and point of view of the world that surrounds one. Also, it develops thinking and imagination which makes one more creative and creativity, on its part, is the main driving force and the key to success in life.
So, to sum up, although, by definition theory and practice are contrasted, they are interrelated in that the one cannot go without the other, that is why university degrees, no matter how theoretical they may be, have a great value. And, in order to be useful for the real world, all that is needed, is that the information they provide be well-combined with practice.

BGSU1270,3.5,3.5,,,,,"Some people say that in our modern world, dominated by science and technology and industrialisation, there is no longer a place for dreaming and imagination. What is your opinion?","
Once upon a time, there was a place when people lived in their little easy houses with no electricity or telephone. They used the fire as a natural source of warmth and their own eyes and mouths to communicate their thoughts and feelings. They were certain in their happiness, there was nothing more they needed. But suddenly, someone invented the lamp and they found out that it became brighter in their houses, then someone invented the TV set, another - the cooker, the telegraph... We may say - life became easier - people had no longer to gather logs or run miles to hear the relatives. So, what is the lesson of the whole story? - Time flies and people gradually realize their needs and the potential of the world around to improve the way of life.
As people are gifted with reasoning, it is natural for them to gave the ability to use their reason in a slightly different way - to dream and imagine, to fall into a reverie and to get lost in their own in use. No science or some industrial machine can prevent them from doing so. Of course, we need technology as an inevitable pert of our lives but its creations do not have to be regarded as evil inventions whose aims is to destroy the romantic visions of life in men. They can even rekindle our imagination depending, of course, on what kind of dreams any one of us had.
I can safely claim that most of the inventors have put a small drop of their imagination in everything they have done. Surely, their inventions ate a result of a lot of calculation, experiments and genius but you need something more to create computer game, for example, you need something that will stimulate the thought of children. Inventors also lean on their dreams of the untouchable horizons of the new and the high. Usually, people who deal with science are really obsessed with it, their mind is capable of achieving the impossible. Therefore, they really rely on the extra-parameters of their brain.
Maybe I should touch upon the two extremes of the question - people who are plunged into the technical world and people who have not the slightest idea of it. If we take the children as an example of the first extreme - children who tend to sit in front of the computer for hours, concentrated on some game or on their chat in the net this activity, to some extent blocks their perception and awareness of the surrounding world, but it can let their fancy roam. There is also room for dreaming although the question of the kind of dreams children have nowadays is quite problematic. The reverse of the medal - people who are not interested in modern technologies may be more disposed to dreaming because they are not burdened with such specific information but that is not always the case.
Whether you are man of science or you have never touched this area, it makes no difference to your imaginative power. Even the greatest inventor may be considered as a hopeless dreamer, so, it is all up to the individual and their peculiarities. If there were no dreams in our world, how would it develop? Namely our dreams make us seek for the better ahead.

BGSU1276,4.0,3.5,,,,,"In his novel ""Animal Farm"" George Orwell wrote ""All men are equal but some are more equal than others"". How true is this today?","
Generally, the question of equality has always been one of interminable dispute throughout the centuries of existence of human society. At one stage of development society didn't comprehend the meaning of that word as it was deprived of equality and people understood that as being the normal state of things. Later on, revolutions took place and some men of advanced views showed the others that they were equal to rich men as all men possess heart and soul that are of the same quality, consequently, it was considered that all men are equal, or at least, that all men should be equal. And I think this is what Orwell meant by what he wrote in his novel. That is, people should be equal, but they are not.
To start, democratic societies today claim that all men are 'equal and that they have the same rights and all that lip service. If you ask a politician what he or she think about equality they'd tell you that everybody's equal to everybody and that everybody's free to do what they want as far as they don't break the law. While at the same time this politician would live in a luxurious house, would wear Versace suits and his children would go to Cambridge University. Meanwhile ordinary people (whom the politician called equal to him) walk step over one another in their 42 m2 flats, would never buy new clothes and their children would start working under-paid jobs at the age of fourteen. Some would say that one gets what he deserves but I should remind them something very important they'd forgotten. I should tell them that the same people that they say, ""deserve"" something are the ones who elected them, the ones who gave them power and authority and all their belongings are a result of other people's efforts in trying to earn their living - by hard work.
Besides, if we follow their principle that one gets what he deserves, what did they do in order to deserve their wealth and power? Were they something better than the rest of us? What exactly was their contribution to society? But let us leave politicians alone. As a matter of fact, they don't even deserve the ink in my pen.
To summarize, I should say what I think is the right answer to what Orwell meant. He was just trying to express what we all know but never had the guts to confess to ourselves. People had never been equal and would never be, actually. And that, consequently, is the normal state of tings. Whatever they tell you, whatever pompous words they use, you my poor ordinary friends, would be never be equal to the ones above. Just think of the expression when you refer to politicians and wealthy people - ""the ones above"" - and you would probably realize where the problem is, it is in ourselves, in our minds and in our motivations; in the way we walk the streets of nothingness.

Against the background of today's unemployment it may seem quite reasonable that society should demand more practically oriented courses at the universities, which could enlarge youth's chances of finding a job. However, I cannot agree that the value of theoretical courses should be flatly denied. They also have their importance for and contribution to society's development, though it may seem that they serve no practical purpose and are therefore good for nothing.
First of all, no science can be more important or of higher value than the others, they all develop human mind and intelligence, decypher various spheres of life and explain the world to people from different point of view. The role of all of them is equally important - to educate and thus help everyone get a better understanding of their environment and hence - get on better in it. The theoretical sciences also perform this role and are therefore not devoid of importance. It's only that their language and methods are more complex and elaborate than that of the more practical sciences. That's what makes theoretical sciences not easy to understand and why a lot of people find them useless.
However abstract it might be, no science is absolutely detached from every-day life, because when we came to think of it, every theory and example is based on observations of reality. That is how the ancients gave rise to the sciences which we nowadays continue developing. Philosophy for example is a typical theoretical science, based on observations of human behaviour and relationships. It cannot endow us with a kitchen robot or same other smart gauget to make things for us easier, but it could help us sort out our problems thus making, an engineer for example, more fit for work, so that he could construct that kitchen robot for us.
We could therefore say that as a theoretical science is based on reality as every other science is, it could serve some sort of practical purposes. In the past, for example, the Stoicks could determine the nature of a disease by merely paying attention to the patient's pronounciation, while nowadays phonetics and phonology can be treated as absolutely theoretical, because one could make a living only by teaching them to students, however we don't know what's there for us in the future. Perhaps phonetics and phonology could turn out to be of great assistance in recognizing aliens; or Saussure's ideas that only language exists and we are its constructs could one day present us with a new explanation of what we, humans, actually are; or some other theoretical science could simply be implemented into practice in some other way.
For the time being , however, those of us, who fear that theoretical courses won't help them earn their living could as well pick up something else. Theoretical sciences, however, should not be looked upon as unimportant only because they provide no profit in practice. They should be fostered and promoted because their potential is great and they could surely present us with an answer to a lot of questions that have haunted human minds from times immemorial.

As time goes by, as the world and the social environment change, in an attempt to adopt to them, our human nature changes too. Nowadays we live in the era of computers, digital mechanisms, satellites and myriads of other apparatuses, whose complex constructions could make you feel dizzy. This imposing and puffing world of cog wheels and microchips may quite well make dreaming and imagination look old-fashioned and totally out of place, for they have always been associated with a somewhat romantic feature of the human character, while the whole world today is sort of practically oriented. Given a little consideration, however, this conclusion would turn out to be totally groundless, because it's easy to see that this whole grand world of magnificent technical and scientific inventions is based exactly on human dreams and imagination. It's these human characteristics that make progress possible and faster it.
Every human being has its own dreams. A small child wants to become en engineer, an engineer wants to become a famous inventor. They all imagine what their life will be like when their dreams come true - it's sure to be more comfortable. Thus motivated to make the most out of life they aspire to fulfill their dreams, a lot of efforts are needed for that, however. One has to study hard and work hard, to develop one's skills and intelligence, which results in a very well educated, highly competitive world work force, whose potentialities have to be explored and made use of.
Then, implementing into practice all their knowledge, which they have acquired in pursuit of their dreams, people inevitably bring civilization forward and contribute to the world's progress.
Apart from giving an impulse to success and development, dreaming and imagination are also and endless source of ideas. In the heat of hard work or in the silence of a rest, whenever his imagination is in full swing, a scientist would came up with amazing ideas about same new inventions. His dreams of success would foster him to develop them and the new technical child of science would slowly start taking shape in the inventor's mind. His imagination would play with every scheme and structure constructing, deconstructing or rearranging it, and its' only then that the final version would be put down on paper. And no matter how many people will take part in its construction, this invention will remain on principle a creation of one person's imagination. Any further improvements made on it, or the mere keeping up of it running well should again be attributed to one's ability to use one's imagination.
It turns out that the whole complex world of machines, which at first sight seems to put off any notion of dreaming and imagination, actually rests almost entirely on them. every complex mechanism is somebody's fulfilled dream and behind every apparatus there's somebody's imagination to create it and regulate it. If it wasn't for dreaming and imagination there would be no progress, but only stagnation. And no matter how much human nature will change in the course of time, dreaming and imagination, I believe, will always be there, for it's them that ensure us a better life and make us what we are - humans.

'Social issues have always been main issues. Though.. issuing nothing but further speculations.
One such matter of dispute is and will always be the matter of equality in human communities. Let us consider the statement of George Orwell and approach it in a close manner. There are characteristics that are valid for the entire human race: all people have their weight, submissive to the global laws of gravitation; they have to eat and drink in order to survive, they all move in one direction or another and finally, they all die. These properties and qualities equalize all representatives of humanity. There is no one who can avoid gravitation, not to mention their instincts or their death. Humanity is a piece of music existing in space where all the tones, all the instruments, all the diverse strains of the melody equally contribute for it to sound rhythmical, massive, tiny, bright;, gloomy, romantic, rebellious... in every stretch of time. Thanks to an invisible equalizer music is organized and equalized as to feel like an ear-candy. The ears of gods can never get tired or bored with the music of humanity... We have to accept, anyway, that sometimes they add tinges from their own imagination... With their help people involve themselves into wars, which in its turn serves as a bombastic sound effect and makes a little turbulance in the stream of humanity music... Men are still equal, for, again they are all equally needed: in a fight there are always two sides -winners and losers - in equilibrium. This was the issue of equality discussed from a bird's ""ear"" position. If we dip a little bit into the cells of humanity, its integral schemes and electronic flows, all of them comprised by the notion of society, we will have to focus our reflection on the second part of Orwell's expression. It is obvious that the difference is one of quantity rather than one of quality, for we already got enough evidence showing that in the quality aspect human beings are absolutely equal. The distortion of equality is nor visible nor audible for gods at all. It is actually a matter of degree. Some are more equal than others. In fact, this simply means that some men weigh more than others, eat and drink more, move less and die less frequently than others. These others weigh less, eat and drink less, move more and die more frequently. As we can see, the degree also comes in two trends: this is another way to reveal the global equilibrium of social existence (survival): the group of the more equal and the group of the less equal. The distribution, however, again has something to do with the quality of being equal. A 'closer observation of the two groups of social units (men) will prove that units can be both in the group of the less equal and the one of the more equal at one and the same time.
In conclusion we can say that there are no political systems, systems for payment, security systems or biological ones that could manage to provoke any kind of change in this universality of the quality of being equal... Gods will always enjoy the melody of our social life equalized by their perfect hi fi music system.

It is hardly surprising that our contemporary world of complex technology and sophisticated ideas has given rise to the pressing necessity of revising our concepts about education. Education won the battle for the right to be regarded as an integral part of our everyday life and society and the fact that it is getting more and more the target of attention is quite telling. Therefore the question why we need education already sounds outdated and obsolete. The main purpose can be outlined in the following way-To give us knowledge and preparation for life. There are various kinds of institutions through which education is spread-schools, colleges, universities. However, a particular attention has always been paid to universities. A dictionary definition would run in the following way- universities are educational institutions designed for instruction and examination and concerned with advanced learning. Alma Mater is the place where culture and science dominate and also a place which ""gives birth"" to professionals and specialists in various fields.
In my opinion, the key words in the definition above are ""instruction"" and ""advanced learning"". It is recognized that universities answer the need for professionals-they give our society doctors, architects, teachers. Instruction is a term which may be confined only to its narrow sense- giving knowledge on a given subject. However, apart from this main purpose, through learning at university we are supposed to develop as mature human beings. The other key term- advanced learning shows an important aspect of the concept.
It is a valid truth universities are designed for people, capable and willing to attain a higher degree of knowledge and skills on a more advanced level fact that Universities are still considered as the most conservative educational institutions. They provide courses based on the theoretical approach and are concentrated on supplying as much information as possible. And that is how the danger of being ""lost"" in the information jungle comes into existence. Hence, theory must be adequately presented and ""cutting"" it into blocks and units is against prescription. It must follow a certain kind of logical connection, continuity and cohesion in the facts. On the other hand, if you are particularly interested in a given field you need to know the basis which can serve as a guidance to achieve further progress. A person with little theoretical preparation resembles the situation in which a traveler sets on a journey with a map but without knowing how to read it. That is why theory is of crucial importance but it should be presented clearly and logically, in a consistent way, so that students could ""stand"" on its solid ground and to come to their own conclusions and argue persuasively. That is how the opposition ""studying"" versus ""learning ""can be reconciled. Such away of processing the information will encourage a different and more flexible understanding.
Universities are places which can help us build ourselves as mature and confident people.
They are institutions which prepare people for careers that will suit their ambitions and talents. The emphasis has always been placed on acquiring the highest possible level of proficiency at a given subject. Still, life itself is a life-long learning process. You keep learning new things practically every day and whether we will fail or cope in the real world depends on our flexibility and eagerness to show initiative. Theory-based University degrees are not of little value because they offer a broader view on the world and a focus on a particular subject.
Yet, there is still that discrepancy between ""competence"" and ""performance"", isn't there?

Dreams have already been sung about, written about so many times. They have also been filmed. I remember what '2 Brothers on the 4th Floor"" said about them - ""Dreams they will survive.
They make a wish come true. You keep the dreams alive"". Another example I could think of is Gabrielle's debut single ""Dreams"" - ""Dreams can come true. Look and you will find them in you.
You know you got to have them..."" And there was the movie ""Arizona Dream"" where Johnny Depp believed that someday he would fly.
I dream. I dream all the time - in the tram, in my bed, at school, at the park bench. Dreaming is a spiritual need, it is a touch with another world, different virtual world - of illusions, expectations, beauty, world without aggression. Dreaming is one of the basic human characteristics. This is something nobody can forbid us to do. They are something that nobody can put their hand upon.
It is beyond people's power. Even the time in which we live can't. Nor can the globalization or whatever high technologies.
I don't think that there is a specific time when dreaming is a wide-practiced thing. It has always been with us no matter the degree of human progress, everyone dreams - of something better to happen in their lives, dreams are a kind of spiritual condition. They are a way of escaping our cruel and gray reality. You can go anywhere on the wings of the dream, you can meet interesting people, you can do everything! And even the fast making way of life can stop us from dreaming.
However, often we encounter its fierce face it is not capable of destroying our instincts and dreams one part of them. After all everything is momentary just dreams and love last - part of our present and a bridge towards our future.
Some say that dreams are and expression of the hidden deep in us, the unfulfilled. They are expression of feelings, emotions, they are a flow of thought and imagination.
But apart from simple imagining the word ""dreaming"" has another in my opinion more important meaning. ""Dreaming can be substituted for point, goal, aim in life. They are a kind of stimulus in life. When you have something to expect for, when you want is so bad and never give up then you have a meaning in life. And maybe exactly dreams are what keeps this world turning - everyone tries to achieve something and meanwhile bumps in many other things, bumps with actual life.
One distinguished American writer said: ""The heart is never sad when it seeks its dreams"". And if I may paraphrase what another famous writer said it would sound like this: ""Dreams will save the world"". I believe in this. And I believe in my dreams.

When God made the human race he made all the humans equal, Equal in their possessions, minds, absolutely everything. But I guess that when God mixed the mixture he put a wrong ingredient too without noticing. And it spoiled everything, it transformed into a flow of the first men. Then he condemned us and it was inherited by the following generations.
As a whole we the humans are a cursed race. It is deeply rooted in us to kill, to steal, to lie.
Sooner or later it all comes out. We've been living on that planet for thousands of years now but there are certain things which will never change. One of them is the evil rooted in us. George Orwell was right because he was writing what he was seeing, he was writing reality. The present time is not much different from the time before two hundred years for instance. The bad people have always been bad and the good people have always been at the bottom. This is mostly true today in the 21st century when the driving force behind every person is the personal success at the expense of the others. Well, almost every person. The people who think only of their wealth think they are something more than the others, they think they can do whatever they want - these are the people we call ""more equal"".
Orwell's comparison of humans to animals is perfectly adequate. Because what are we? We are claimed to be the highest animal kind. Like them we are often guided by the instinct of self- preservation which makes us do bad things to others. Makes us neglect others, betray them, hurt them. When we follow that instinct we are blind for everything else but our survival. Another reason that makes people think they are ""special"" is money. Yes, the powerful money. They can put a man high in the clouds and block his common sense. When a person has money they think that the world is their, that it belongs to them. And what happens when they get a lot of money?
They become the world's best creatures. And want more and more money, this is loftiness and arrogance come from, from their sense of superiority and importance.
Yet another reason would be if a person has a right social position. For instance, a congressman, a TV journalist, a rich banker. They watch people from above. The ""special"", ""more equal people"" are everywhere, there isn't a certain place where they could be found, they are all around us. Of course, there are people who don't have any basis for their arrogance and ""speciality"".
Yes, Orwell couldn't has been more right than. People are cruel, they kill each other, they destroy their lives. And this is because one thinks that is more than the others. it's hard time we live in and everyone tries to play their role in this life neglecting the others.

If we take a look back in time we are in a position to see man dreaming, philosophizing and using his imagination of whatever comes his way. We see man transcending his ego I a way and thus becoming a God - like figure. And by putting down these sacred words, what is taking shape in my mind is the fact that using his imagination Man is no longer this organic and material substance like his contemporary counterpart who is putting his trump card on science, technology and industrialization but Man is a way transcends himself through his imagination.
For instance, if we take into account the Renaissance or Romantic periods of mankind and close our eyes we could see Shakespeare applying his imagination in the fancy world of his comedies: elf and nymphs circling the stage making it a dream that will lost forever in our minds.; we could even hear their high-pitched weird chuckle piercing with a gentle touch our ears, But ""open those eyes that must eclipse the day"" and you'll wee the high-tech wiping out every trace of the human elevated spirit that have dominated over the previous centuries. What we see now is ""deux aux machina"" or the fake ""God from the machine"" who with the touch of a button could unleash Armageddon.
For poets and literate people of yore it was a common idea to transcend reality or to go beyond it by using their imagination not by using reason as we the homosapiens of our time do. For example, if we indulge in entertaining the idea of the film ""The matrix"" it has a lot to do with the period of Romanticism. But the difference is that a poet from that time could transcend reality, become one with Nature, and cruise wherever he wants using his imagination. Whereas now in the 21st century and in ""The matrix"" in particular the scientific type of Man thinks that at last he has succeeded in making travelling without boundaries via the virtual reality of his PC.
As a logical conclusion to my essay I would like to put only one thing. ""Wouldn't it be better if imagination makes the world go round"". If I was to answer this question, the answer would be positive, but given the aquisitive or consumer society conditions we live in let's make a match between imagination and science. It would be somewhat more realistic.

The machines made by and for man are just making the wheel of life and fortune move faster. They open up new horizons, naturally, move and more abstract from nature. But what is nature in fact? It is the machines that are destroying nature. But man stands behind them.
It is the that speed up human life. But it is a man's dream from the very birth - to live free, to live longer, better, faster. Man is nature and nature is man, Imagination schemes perfect machines, dreaming draws a perfect world. His fantasy annihilates so hat his dream lives. And man makes tools. No matter how sophisticated science and machines are. They are just techniques to control the world, to better see, hear and know. Knowing is believing. And new dreams are born, faster, higher ones. Dressed in titan plates, armed with laser guns, flying through the Universe. Universal dreams.
Truly, people live differently now. Seldom they walk out; rare are the occasions when one has time and time is the only technology's enemy. Man is also. Work now never stops, helped and supervised and done by machinery. There is less and less time left. The pulse of life throbs faster and faster, speed is almost everything. Speed and the need. The need and wish for power, money and what one can get with them. Has it ever been the other way? Have the dreamers ever been in charge of? In charge of something else than their own fantasy worlds. There could never be an end to man's imagination. Not until there's a machine that dreams. And such machine would be called a dreamer, not a machine...
Do not let hope die. There's still a chance for the world to be beautiful, better, more human, friendly and smiling. Let the machines help us. Let the diseases die faster, invalids move longer, the disabled be somehow enabled, the opportunities - more. Dream and imagine with and without machines. The world is not a machine. Its hearts beats.

All men are equal. It is presumed that God made them so. Still all throughout the history of his species man have fought for equality. It has turned out that indeed some men are more equal than others. at least socially. And that is quite naturally.
All men cannot be equal. Each one of us is born with different capacity of mind and heart, at different places, under different conditions. Some have more wits or are more open-hearted than others, some have loving parents and a happy childhood, others do not. Some were born with a certain position in society which have secured them better opportunities for education, professional realization, personal or social success, for achieving their goals. Some were handicapped by the conditions of life under which they were born from their first breath of air to the last beat of their heart, entangled in a cruel reality, fighting for every piece of bread in order to keep living just to be able to go on fighting.
Some like their inherited position of life, others do not. Some conform it, others rebel. Some fight for equality, others for a higher status to be more equal than the others.
All men cannot be equal. Not each of us want to have the same conditions of life, opportunities or privileges as the others, some want better ones. Some want to be rich. The some money from the rich, give it to the poor and then we all shall be equal and happy. But there will always be someone who will wish to have more money, to be more equal.
Some want to have social power. Give more civil rights to the oppressed, restrict the influence of the powerful and we again shall be equal. But shall we be powerful? Over what and, most of all, over whom shall we exert our power? Here comes the need of unequality. There have to be oppressed to make the others feel powerful. Moreover, being influential and having power is not easy as it seems.
All men cannot be equal. That is just an utopia. A beautiful dream cherished in the hearts of generations of men throughout the centuries. Our life is based on inequality. Society, even nature is based on inequality. Some say that life is a jungle. In the jungle one cannot afford themselves to be weak and unfit. If one is not strong enough, they simply perish. The stronger need the weaker to live on them. It is the best that survive. The most equal one. There should be death to secure life. There is life owing to inequality. Inequality produces the fittest, the ones who survive.
It makes the world turn and the social system work.
Inequality is recognized and accepted by men. What else is the evolutionary theory about the survival of the fittest than a rejection of equality. If all were equal who would have survived.? All of us?
Still men are fighting for equality. The idea of it lies in the foundation of one of the most powerful social ideologies - socialism. And its realization proved that even among equal there are some that are more equal. It is inevitable.

BGSU1302,3.0,,,,,,"In his novel ""Animal Farm"" George Orwell wrote ""All men are equal but some are more equal than others"". How true is this today?","
This is today as it was many years ago and as it will be for many years to come.
Throughout the whole human history there have always been people who were more equal than the others. In the past inequality of men had been absolutely real. And in my opinion it had been better that way because there had been a social hierarchy and everybody knew their place.
Today, for example, everywhere is claimed that all people are equal and at the same time nobody respects the rights of the others.
In the past the poor were equal among themselves, that is they didn't have any rights. Then as well as today money dictates conditions. The right is on the side of the rich. In past times when pharaohs lived this idea had been valid as it is today. The power have always been in the hands of the rich kings, dictators, politicians who dictate the rules. But now such people use their power to oppress the poor ones, and its worse now because we should be all equal. Everybody should get equal chance to start their way in life, and not be hampered in everything they try to achieve in the future.
This concerns very much the situation in our country and especially the young people. On the one hand they are forced to live in inhuman conditions, in dirty and noisy hostels and even to fight that ""honour"" because others ""equal"" by rights have already managed to put to the more fit to live in rooms by corrupting the board of directors. I don't think that people who can afford to pay bribes need a hostel to live in.
In the student's town in Sofia there can be seen people (students) who drive BMW and Mercedes and at the same time the poorer students can't find a place to sleep because just one hundred hadn't been enough to except them in a hostel, and they can't afford to pay for an accommodation.
On the other hand, when students graduate they don't get the equal chance to start their careers.
Here in fashion are the various connections one has with very important persons. It is very easy when someone cleans the road for you and you just walk ahead. It is very difficult for a young man or woman to prove themselves in such a hostile society.
Today the more corrupted and the more cheating, the more rich you are the more equal you are.
Otherwise we are all equal at least it is written in the text of every constitution of every civilized country. But this is only on paper and nobody really respect it. Politicians have the habit to refer to it when there are elections. They promise a lot of things along with equality for everyone. But when the whole campaign is over and they get the power in their hands, they become more equal than others and forget their promises.
In my opinion as long as money rule the world and there are no laws to check the power of people with money and no conscience there will always be people more equal than others.

CNUK1003,3.5,3.5,,,,,Most university degrees are theoretical and do not prepare students for the real world. They are therefore of very little value,"
Not only one or two many of my peers view our university degrees with scepticism. They often said: ""what we learn in universities are mainly from books which usually are theoretical rather than practical. After years of study, we graduate with degrees. But we got nothing more than theoretical knowledge, which are not well-matched up with the real world. And for those who are not holding any degrees, they also become very successful in their careers. Therefore, it makes us feel that our university degrees are of little value.""
As a university student myself, I used to share the same feeling. But now, I want to say, this is only partly true. In my opinion, learning the theories is basic as well as necessary. Thus university degrees are by no means of little value.
I can not deny that what we learn at universities are mostly theoretical things. I still remember on the first day of my beloved university, one of my professors said to me: ""from now on, you'll be on a journey between who you think you are and who you can be. The key is to allow yourself to continue the journey in the ocean of books."" And I do spent plenty of my time on reading books and studying the subjects provided by the university. Of course, I learned a lot: I knew the logic of Aristotle, the cultures and conventions of different countries in the world, the economic principles and the regulations of foreign trades, the political policies, etc. not until had I worked as an interpreter in Guangdong Commodities Trade Fair did I realized how important these theoretical knowledge was. If I hadn't learnt it beforehand, I couldn't figure out how to deal with foreign business partners, whether the way we did would violate the international trade regulations. Therefore I came to know that all the theories serve as basic knowledge which can guild us to run on the right tract.
And I can not deny that many people without university degrees hold important positions in our society. They not only can share the some kind of jobs as university degrees holder do, but also are more capable in many aspects. However, it's easy for me to point out that more and more of them nowadays go back to campus to fulfil their university degrees or study by themselves at their spare time to pass examinations to get the certificates.
Three years ago, one of my friend's father, who is nearly 50 years old, quit his high salary job as an experienced engineer and started to study English and advance mechanism in an open college in Guangdong. Now he has got B.A. degree and works as an advanced engineer in a joint venture. He told me: ""Thanks to the past two-year-study, I could enter a new era of my career."" 
More and more people who hadn't been highly-educate but well-experienced in their jobs share the same thought with him. They know if they get more theoretical knowledge to combine with their own practical skills, they will be able to fully used their potential in their jobs as well as in other aspects. That is why open colleges are booming up in recent years.
Above all, I totally agree with what Francis Bacon, the well-known English writer, wrote on his famous essay Of Study, "" Histories makes me wise, poets, witty; the mathematics, subtle; natural, philosophy, deep; moral, grave; logic and rhetoric, able to contend."" We study nearly all the subjects he mentioned at universities. When we graduate with all the things we have learnt, we have already set up a solid foundation for our selves building in the future. How can we say university degrees are of little value?

Although some people believe each practice comes from theory, some argue that interning in the real world is more important than learning from book. My consideration about the issue is either focusing on only theory or just practice is not a correct way.
Firstly I am going to talk about the Chinese education. Known by every Chinese citizen that the students are always forced to stay in campus reading the textbooks and what's more, the edition of those textbooks are usually very old. For example, I'm a student of continuing education, what I learn, lexicology, is a book complied in 1980's even though I have to take an Provincal exam in 2004.
It's no doubt to say even when the book has published and sold to a customer, it has been overfashioned, like a back number magzine, let alone a 1980's version to a student who is studying in 2003. Imagine if now students still depend on such useless information. What a meaningless choice for us to study just in order to get a degree! I remember dad had ever told me, what he learned while he was 17 was how to mend television. At that time, all televisions in china were not colour TV, so the method used to repair them was quite different from repairing a colour TV. In spite of spending a lot of time learning repairing black-and -white TV, dad had to refresh what he had learned when colour TV appeared. When I was young, I memorize, the colour TV in our home was always mended by dad. Of course, we could save some money for we didn't need to pay like other families to get their television repaired. But now, television of different brands come to rise and various televisions own their typical way to be repaired. Mean while, the technology of producing television is far more improving now. Dad now can't use what he learned in the past to mend our television without question. So, is the degree he got helpful to him in the contemporary society? Certainly not! As the sentence we all know ""we're not too old to learn"", we study in a university or a college, not aiming at getting a degree, but learn how to learn. For this reason, the textbook, especially a latest version is quite a vital important to us.
Since I haven't studied in a foreign university or a college, I don't have the opportunity to accept a foreign education. But I heard students who come back from a foreign university ( Brock University in Canada) said overseas education is a new continent to Chinese students.
Unlike Chinese education system, western educational system are maturer. Contract to Chinese one, if you are studying in a university in Britain, it's not only you have to be present each class and need to summarize what you have learned for a span of a semester ( i.e. you have to do assigment to practice and master you learned in the class), but also you'd better get ready to prepare for the final exam. Either one you failed, it will affect your final score of this term. This kind of system is a transparent restriction to every student telling them that they can't attain success by cunning playing but diligent character and honesty.
Besides, western education put practice and textbooks together, that is to say, no matter how much they had learn, what they use in the real world is just what's admitted by people. So, when you are working in a business company in a western country, if when something serious happens in an affair and you use only the theory you learned form the textbooks to deal with it, people will certainly look down upon you. And to some extent, you may not solve the problem by what the textbooks tell you.
All in all, practice and theory are the same importance. Owing both them when you get your degree, that degree must your own gold.

CNUK1005,3.5,,,,,,Most university degrees are theoretical and do not prepare students for the real world. They are therefore of very little value,"
As a university student, when I entered the university and chose my major, I found a phenomenon that some subjects offered are theoretical, which caused the students' complaints. They think the theoretical courses are not only boring and difficult to learn but also less practical. The present would needs people with practical skills and knowledge to solve the problem in their work. Moreover, when they apply for a job, they stuck in a dilemma situation: they possess the diploma or a degree requested, but they haven't experience or lack adequate practical ability.
We are now entering a brand new era, a completely new stage in its history. The new century is a time of advanced scientific and technological knowledge. As the rapid development of science and technology, there are rapid changes in all aspects of our life, even the value concept. Today is a era quite different from the time when those writers, poets and artists were highly respected. They most desired and hot professions are president of big company, CEO, manager, engineers, doctors, and so on.
So when the students choose their major, their parents also approve them to choose some hot majors, so that they can easily find a decent job, make a comfortable life or even make a fortune.
However, there are also some people agree that superficially some theoretical courses have no practical value, but without the theoretical knowledge, one cannot develop overall. But we should know everyone has limited time and energy, therefore it is impossible and unwise to emphasize too much on some theoretical subjects. We have to face the reality, we should remember a worthy saying: ""the survival of the fittest."" The heavy pressure from the job market forces us to put our limited time and energy into practical courses. If we don't adopt ourselves to the development of our society, we will be eliminated in the fierce competition.
When we were children, our parents often told that if you don't study hard you will be a unuseful person. So they toiled everything to support our life and education. They send us to the school and hope us can get good education and will find a good job in the future. That's their plain dream, but what we will see? A student study three or four years in the university, after graduating he find that it really hard to find a decent job, and the knowledge he acquired in the university is not as useful as they expected. In contrary we may find some people without high degree but they have high practical ability and skills, they really like a duck in the water when they apply for a job. Education aims to arm people with more knowledge so that adds to their competitioners in their future career and enables them to live better. If the education is the university don't follow the development of our society and the courses offered are too theoretical but less practical, we dare say the education just decorate our life but give us nothing.
Things are always changing, with the passage of time, some major are not to be in great demand. We your generation should keep pace with the latest advance of science and technology. Here I'd like to mention another thing - teaching material. Not long ago a friend of mine talked about his university life, he said, in his first class in the university the professor told the students that the subject was not only boring (because it was a theoretical course) but also what they would study was the research result of fifty years ago. He felt very angry and asked the professor a question "" Why should we learn this subject, we come here is to learn the up-to-date knowledge, not such useful rubbish. When I heard this, I felt very sorry. The school administrators have to know what is in need in the labor maket and then decide which courses they should offered to the students. I still remember a passage which said "" We'd not educate children only for the purpose of educating them; our purpose is to fit them for life."" That 's really true.
When I talked here, I think of our education system. It has to improve. Education is key to strength of a country. In long-term, the school cultivate the young generation not only enable them live better but also cultivate more talents for our country. It is the high time to pay more attention to this issue and do something for it.

CNUK1007,2.5,3.5,,,,,Television is the opium of the masses in modern society. Discuss.,"
THE ORIGINAL MEANING OF TELEVISION
Television is now the opium of the masses in modem society. Is that true? Some people say no, but some say yes.
TV is an abbreviation of television. Television is explained in a dictionary as a piece of electrical equipment in the shape of a box. It has a glass screen which shows programmes with moving pictures and sounds. And it has another meaning which is the programmes that are shown on a television set.
Television was invented in the middle of the 19 century. It had a meaning of recording and transmitting limited knowledge of the world to people and entertaining people. In those times of days, people could watch very short TV programmes. The reasons why people watched television was that: firstly, it was very new to people, and it was such an interesting and smart thing following the film. Secondly, it was enjoyable and convenient. So that people did not need to go out to see films but sit in their house, watching TV and enjoying their good time anytime with their family. Finally, people could see more things and know more than their own world easily and instantly.
THE CHANGING MEANING OF TELEVISION
With the time flying, the meaning of television has been changing. It now can also be explained as the electrical system and business of sending out programmes so that people can watch them on their television sets. Now television do not have only one or two simple functions of entertaining people etc but also doing business with people. It means that television is being used for profit. With more and more people watching TV, more and more different programmes are coming out to meet different people's need. Now people can easily access to all kinds of TV programmes and people can have a lot of choices of TV channels such as BBC1, BBC2, ITV and Channel 4 etc. which most people are watching. Sky TV is one of them, but it is a kind of digital TV programme service which means people need to pay more to have more channel to watch. For example, carton channel, sport channel and even adult channel. More choices of channels is certainly a good thing, but bad sides of it are coming up as well.
Firstly, more and more programmes are involving violence and sex including films and entertaining programmes which children can easily access. This is a big problem to children. They are exactly opium to children. As it is known that children have not enough ability to tell what is right and what is wrong and they can learn things very fast. They only imitate what TV shows. For them, TV programmes are all right. They do not know that what they are doing is actually wrong. These may affect their lives in the future.
And, there are too many advertisements shown on televisions. More than half them are not exactly the same to their advertising products. They are indirectly telling people incorrect information of the world. Their repeating adverts make people believe that everything is so beautiful and forget the negative side of world. This could be said irresponsible.
In conclusion, televisions bring people happiness of time and at the same time worries.

CNUK1015,3.5,,,,,,Most university degrees are theoretical and do not prepare students for the real world. They are therefore of very little value,"
A criticism often heard these days is that most universities degrees are theoretical and do not prepare students for the real world. They say that a tendency for college students to have difficulties in finding jobs when they graduate is growing. They hold the opinion that lack of practical knowledge in the university resulted in this situation.
In the first place, preparing students for the real world is demanded by our ever-developing society. As society has entered the information age and commercialisation is sweeping across the world, some practical courses such as computer and business courses are geared to the social demand. Conversely, if a student has little knowledge of computer or business, he will lag behind the time. Therefore, it seems that most universities degrees are either too theoretical or too academic, so that they cannot be directly applied to the tasks of real life.
In the second place, practical knowledge has a direct bearing on future job prospects. There is on denying the fact that the students better equipped with practical knowledge and more competitive in job hunting, while those majoring in History, Geography and the like have few job opportunities. It turns out that many of them have to take jobs below their abilities. That means their university degrees are not or little valuable to them.
In the third place, a number of successful people, who almost have no experience of studying at a university, are attracting all the students' attention from all over the world. In fact, they believed that university and institutes are not the place where you can learn something about the real world. A case in point is Bill Gates, who made a huge amount of fortune without university degree.
But people who hold the opposite opinions maintain that university degrees are valuable to most of the students. At first, universities can provide the basic theories. The subjects taught at universities have evolved naturally and have withstood the test of time. They represent the wisdom and experience of our antecedents, among whom there were a lot of great men. And these subjects also equip students with knowledge and confidence to make sound judgements about any problems which may crop up.
Moreover, universities can shape our personalities. For instance, through group life at universities, we become open-minded and have more advantage in social intercourse. It is a reflection of the real world. A good relationship between students and tutors will give them a clue how to deal with the relationship with their boss and colleagues in the future. Remember, universities are small worlds of the society.
Finally, universities usually provide some part-time jobs to the students which not only help them with their financial problems, but also offer them opportunities to touch this real world.
When all the factors are examined, we may safely come to the conclusion that the balance be tipped toward practical courses in university curriculums. University degree, in my opinion, should become more valuable and provide a real world as well.

As the development of science and technology, television has become a major media of entertainment, information and even education. There are all kinds of programmes such as MTV, News, Films, and so on. However, a lot of people resist watching television and they treat it as the opium of the messes in modern society.
Is the situation as serious as that? We can judge this by looking at both the advantages and disadvantages of watching TV. There are a lot of changes happening in the world everyday. You do not need to go and see by yourself but simply get all the timely information from your television. We know where there is on war and where there is a celebration. At this point, newspapers and radios probably are also good resources. The content you get from them, however, are not as vivid as it form television. Moreover, you can just sit in front of your television and enjoy other countries' scenery and learn their culture. Some television programmes tells us history, biography, and geography. Furthermore, we can appreciate the classics, concerts, play and so on through various TV stations. In some places, over 100 channels can be received. All the other media cannot beat television on providing fresh impression with multi-choices. It seems that television has made our life richer and colourful since it was invented.
Although television plays such an important role in our daily life, more and more people think there is a potentially danger in watching TV. It is estimated that, on average, TV has dominated approximately 50% of our life. People get addicted. They cannot help stopping once they start, in particular, the long series. The best example could be the TV Children. The only thing they would like to do is watching TV. They sit in front of television almost over 10 or 12 hours everyday. As a result, most of them have problems with their eyes and with sleep; they perform badly at school; they are not good at communicate with others; they cannot make their own decisions and they cannot concentrate on finishing one thing on their own. Some people claimed that television programmes would stop people's imagination and personal thinking. People tend to accept the ideas and solution from what they see on TV, and their moral is influenced too. People, especially the youth, copy the characters' behaviour in films or the series. For instance, the hero in a film beat the others successfully would be the good example of the audience no matter whether he is a thief or robber. An increased rate of criminal is caused by the violence and sex showed on TV, which even appeared in some cartoons. It is ridiculous that the offender would say I just wanted to try what I had seen from television when he was arrested. Should the victim blamed on both the murderer and the television? 
To sum up, watching television could be a good entertaining if the right amount of time and programmes are chosen. It may be very harmful if people do it immoderately.

All of us love to watch TV, is it the screen of the television very beautiful and attractive? No, we love to watch the TV programs but not the television itself. The series, the soap opera, the news, the special programs and the film, all these are so attractive and every one can easily find one as his favorite. No matter youths, adults, elders or children would easily find the suitable program, which is special designed from their groups by the broadcasting company. The variety of the program is surprising; there are so many choices on all the channels of the whole country. The television program is served 24 hours per day, whenever you turn on the television, there must be some program showing on the screen!
Television affects the masses' life abundantly. The television is our main news source and gives us most of the information that happened everyday in the world. Nothing can match the speed of the television news broadcast; we must to see what is on around us. Satellite live, you can see the football match held in Korea with little seconds difference. You can watch the TV screen to see how the twins' buildings collapsed in New York at the same time. No one can resist the temptation of know the big new happen nowadays immediately, you are unable not to watch TV unless you have not got one in your house.
Alike the opium, the television can make people be addicted. The more you watch it, the more you depend on it. You would turn on the television unconsciously whenever you can, you might just turn it on to make your room not so silent, very soon then you would be attracted by the sounds or words from the television and proceed to gaze at it though the whole dinner time. Gradually you would find you have less and less interest in doing other things, you would prefer to sit in front of the television for a whole night laughing at the extremely stupid guy in the play or indulging in the mysteries and fictions in the series.
Among the office ladies that one of the always-popular office topics is about the series showed yesterday night. If you do not know what is showing on the TV these days, then you must be out of day. If you don't know who is the recent popular movie star, then you must be regarded as out of fashion.
The news would be from TV, the policy idea of our government would be from TV, and the fashion would from TV, television offers such an abundance of information and entertainment for the masses. Though it might consume most of the leisure time to watch it, many people are very willing to watch it all the time instead of doing other thing.

Nowadays, with the popularization of TV more and more people spend much time on watching TV. There are several reasons. Firstly, TV sets and TV license are cheap. And secondly, it's very convenient for people to just stay at home and enjoy the TV shows with the companion of snacks. Thirdly, people can do other things such as weaving while watching TV. But very few of people realize the harm of watching TV for a long time. Spending much time on watching TV not only do harm to your health, waste your time, but also make you slow-witted. And the worse is though some people can realize it but they just can't help watching TV. To some degree, television is the opium to the masses in modern society.
People who spend much time on watching TV are often in bad health. The X-ray from the screen would do harm to people's health, especially to children and pregnant woman. For instant, the X-ray has a bad effect on people's eyesight. Statistics show that many children become glasses wearers result from watching TV continually. At the same time it will make you unwilling to move and the snacks make you fatter.
Wallow in TV programs will waste your precious time. I suppose many of us have such experience: when we were attracted by some TV shows we'll just forget what we are going to do. Actually it will have a bad effect to students' study. For instant, it will break students' schedule and make them forget what's the most important thing to them. Moreover, immerse in TV programs can make you slow-witted. Because most of the programs are very easy, you don't have to think deeply. As time goes by it'll weaken your ability to think and read. Some scientists have proved this point.
In many family, parents and children stay together watching TV for long, but they just focus on the shows and keep silence! How sorrowful it is! And it's the main causes of bad relationship between parents and children. People spend most of their spare time on watching TV and they just forget how to communicate with others because TV built an invisible wall between people.
What we concern most is the irresponsible programs and advertisement's bad effect to children. The violence, sexy and some unhealthy contents in TV programs will misleading the children and show them an unreal world. It's very easy and danger to some children who have weak self-control to imitate the bad character in the TV. And the worse is if children can't fulfill by what advertisement promise ( they'll feel terrible disappointed and some of them will fall into difficult situation and never come out of it.) (Art Buchwald-American feature writer) As mentioned above, that's why we call the TV is and opium to masses.
This brings to another question about what make television become opium to masses. The primary reasons are the modern community provided very few attractive culture activities and culture propagation to people and they would rather stay at home with the company of meaningless programs. It's something like mental opium that made people hard to stop. Wallow in TV shows you will mean nothing. So please turn off your TV and find yourself some meaningful things to do.

CNUK1028,3.5,3.5,,,,,Most university degrees are theoretical and do not prepare students for the real world. They are therefore of very little value,"
There has been a controversial issue about university degrees. Some people proclaim that university degrees are theoretical and do not prepare students for the real world. While others insist that the academic results represent one person's ability in research and the attitiude towards life. Different people hold different opinions on this issue and I shall here explore some primary ones.
Those who hold negative views always regard university degrees as unpractical.
The most obvious reason is that degree can not reflect a person's true capability. It just teach people the skills on how to get a high score in examinations. A survey pointed out, to achieve an undergraduate degree, people work maybe 2880 hours. While people may spend 21 hours on various exam during his or her study in a university. So when you enter exams, the words you write down have to stand for all of your understanding about your study. Although you may read countless books, take tedious notes and revise essay till mid-night, if you fail or get a lower score than you expected in the exam, your hardworking is going to be useless. The final exams just measure a person's ability to take final exams, nothing else.
In addition, the education you have been taught in university is tradtional and few of it can be utilized in society. When you enter an university, you will begin some courses which have been taught for many years. This kind of situation is more conspicuous in China. Many Chinese students used to have to learn some giant's masterpiece. But in fact, this masterwork was written nearly a century ago, and it can just reflect the situation of that period, but not the morden society. Though it may has a historical significance, it is hard to be understood by common people. And it is hard to use in our daily lives. As a result, when you graduated from your school, this couse that we are mentioning will hardly help you to solve problems in the real world. While other people regard university degrees as one of the indispensable factors in people's lives. First, the higher education in universities will give people a chance to accumulate knowledge and enlarge horizons. The education in universities is absolutely different from those in primary schools. It is usually taught by professional staff or some experts in the particular field. They can give you the different points of view towards issues. Depending on their abundant experience, they can tell us the core issue through the complex problems. Second, university degrees are being used as a criterion in the labour market. When you are interviewed in the a company, the first standard the manager of human resource department is going to check is the person's certification. If you had a university degree or a higher degree, there will be no problem for you to fill the vacancy. But if you did not have the education in university, the result of your interview will be known quickly when it finished.
From what have been mentioned above, we may safely come to the conclusion that both of the distinct opinions are reasonable. University degrees maybe very theoretical, but they are surely working in the morden society. If we could erase the unpractical aspects and develop the advantages of education, university degrees are essential for the enhancement of citizen's qualities.

CNUK1033,3.0,3.0,,,,,Television is the opium of the masses in modern society. Discuss.,"
From black and white televisions, to colour televisions, to digitial televisions, the production of television have a rapid growth in the 20th century. Obviously, television is placing an important part in our daily lives, especialy compare to radio. From the first black and white television appeared to human beings, it soon took place of radio dramatically. More and more people are likely to watch tv to relax, gain knowledge or information. There is no doubt that televisions did bring us a lot of fun. However, some people claimed that television is the opium of the masses in modern society. They showed a series of evidence to examplify their words. In my essays, I would like to discuess the pros and cons about televisions.
Firstly, the first advantage of televion is the function of entertainmnet. For example, after a day's study and work, a best way to relax and get together is to watch tv together. A family can be very hammony while watching tv together. You can watch whatevery you like: children are more likely to watch cartoon, young people prefer pop show, while adults like talk show. You can watch tv to prevent from feeling bore. In addition, watching tv is not only for kill time, but also can enjoy the high quailty television progrmmes provided by television station. By watching it, they can help you laugh or understand more and more people and situations. You can know what happen on the world immediately, you can know the weather is like in the following week. Finally, television is a great craetion of human beings and we did benefit a lot from it.
On the other hand, television is putting negative effects on human as well. As we all know, more and more programmes are involving violence, sex and illegal actions, young people are easy to copy these becase they are too young to judge whether it is good or not. This will have a bad infulence on the society, such as, a lot of pupils in America were killed by their classmates is the result of watching too much television programmes. Too much violence and sex will lead to the wrong way to develop the adolesents psychology. Experts pointed out that the flood of sex and violence would kill a rosy futher of young person.
Another disadvantage of television is myopia. According to a research, nearly half of the students are shortsighted. They have to wear glasses everyday because they watch too much tv. The screen of television will directly hurt our eyes. Because of shortsightness, our lives would be more inconvenient. Doctors advise that we should watch less than 2 hours tv everyday to protect our eyes.
To sum up, television did have its own advantages and disadvantags. Both of them is influencing us in many ways. My point is not to decide whether television good or not, that depends on which side you are involving more. Are you a audience, a television programmes producer or a victim?
In fact, television is a great tool. We can make good use of it, that is, maximize the advantages and minimize the disadvantages. For examle, we can make some programmes limited to young people. Producer of programmes must pay attention to the quality of it, not only to attract the audience. We all live in the same house-society. It is our duty to protect from destory.

CNUK1052,3.0,4.0,,,,,Most university degrees are theoretical and do not prepare students for the real world. They are therefore of very little value,"
University degrees nowadays are not as valuable as ten years ago. What we have now is a range of modules including lectures and tutorials. The lecturers, who are mainly from another university, start their non-stop talk on the stage. To prepare the examination, students may cram all model answers of the past papers in their brains. Who cares about what you have got from the books and lessons?
Personally, the usefulness of the courses depends on the university. Some traditional universities produce students with lots of theories - to show their statuses in the society. For example, my sister whose major is Economics, is supposed to be a BBA (Bachelor of Business Administration) graduate three years later. From beginning of first year studies, she has to confront accountings, law, management. She just has to deal with the assignments and essays with the so-called application of Economics. Her desk is full of notes with graphs, curves, calculations and Economics theories. All her counterparts are busy with the assignments and copying others' homework.
If a student wants to differentiate himself or herself from the others, he or she should seek summer intern experience, especially working in a foreign or large company. It is the only way to gain practical working experience and get rid of the lecturers and the university. The competitive edge of my sister is her outstanding records on extra-curricular activities and her summer intern working experience in Beijing. Though I can ensure all university students are eager to work practically more than studying in the library, it is undeniable that a graduate with practical working experience can help write his or her job application after graduated.
Every year, employers describe that university graduates are ""a piece of white paper""-they have to be trained before work! What did they learn from the university? Doing comprehension? Learning how to write a critique or a precis summary? No matter what they acquire from their three-year university life, they have to learn from the beginning-even answer a client's phone call, and write a simple report.
Can I say university degrees are of little value? No! (or why are we studying here?) Though employers comment on the working ability of university graduates, they hold recruitment talks in various universities every year. The attitude is though contradictive, it is clear that a university certificate can indicate a certain ability of a university graduate. For instance, their language proficiency is relatively higher when compared with the non-degree students at the same age. They perhaps can perceive new stuff faster and digest new knowledge easier than the others.
Now many of us come to University of Portsmouth for our final year study here. It is because of a degree certificate which is to prove our ability as an employee. Personally a master degree and a PhD degree only mean self-accumulation of theories and no more. They cannot prove working ability! 
In short, university degrees are not useless in terms of preparing students for the real world. However it cannot ensure a graduate can compete for a post after graduated.

CNUK1055,3.5,4.0,,,,,Television is the opium of the masses in modern society. Discuss.,"
Television is no longer a luxury for anybody. It is far too common in every house in this modern society. Is this a good thing or bad thing? It is good in the sense that it brings a lot of information to the audience as a media tool. It is bad in the way that the TV programmes it offers may affect people's lives, values and morale in the society. However, is television as bad as the opium of the masses in modern society? It is worthwhile to look at the benefits and evils television brings before a conclusion can be made.
Television provides various kind of information to people through broadcasting. The content of TV programmes include news, music, education, entertainment, documentary, traveling, advertisement and etc. These let the audience know what is happening in the world through images rather than just sounds from radio. People can learn different cultures of other countries by looking at the TV set, not necessarily going to travel to achieve this. They can acquire knowledge through some informative programmes like Educational TV which serves a teaching purpose. People can also watch TV to entertain themselves instead of spending money outside home. For example, they can watch local or foreign films; they can enjoy the concerts or orchestra performances without paying a penny. It is therefore more economical.
Television brings a lot of fun to people and a closer relation among people is resulted. For example, a large group of friends gather around the TV set to watch the World Cup. It is amazing and a crowded atmosphere is created just inside a small room or flat.
Nevertheless, there are also side effects of television to this modern society too. People can get addicted to watching TV and affect their daily lives. For instance, people lack of sleep just because they watch TV too often, their work or studies are affected in the day after. This may be a minor aspect. Yet, not all TV programmes are in good quality in the sense that they may be violent, pornographic in content, and there is no supervision of when these programmes should be broadcasted. This will influence those who are easily affected by others where they cannot identify which is right or which is wrong, then there will have adverse effect on their mind and acts. For example, some children or teenagers imitate the images or behaviour from those violent scenes portrayed since they do not have proper parental guidance. This will result in committing crime. What's more, they have incorrect values instilled and they may grow improperly.
In the old days, when television was not commonplace, there were not so many teenagers committing crimes due to the influence of television. As far as television is everywhere, one cannot deny it simply affects our lives. However, it is not as bad as opium that will affect the masses in our society because if people can distinguish the programmes sensibly, the bad results discussed above will not appear. Television is passive, people's decision is active.

CNUK1056,3.5,,,,,,Most university degrees are theoretical and do not prepare students for the real world. They are therefore of very little value,"
What is the use of achieving a university degree? No doubt that many people will say it is mainly for developing future career. If that is true, and that is the expectation of most people, does it mean that in university, more practical knowledge should be taught instead of piles of theories?
Once students are graduated from universities, they will probably become enter the working force to develop their career, and only a small portion, not more than ten per cent usually, choose to further their studies to attain a master degree. That means the time before they start to work, three or four years in university, is used for preparing for the future. In universities, students specialized in certain fields can achieve the academic credits from studying both core subjects and electives. As electives, or options, are not necessarily relevant to the current courses of the students, they can develop their interests there. Most subjects mainly consist of lecture, seminar, tutorial, workshop or laboratory lessons, and obviously, workshop and laboratory lessons are designed for practical purposes such as working in computer room, or practise interpretation in language laboratory. However, there are not many practical lessons in the course, only two to three at the most which only make up 10% of the all the lessons. This implies that most of the time, students are required to sit in the classroom and the teachers spoon-feed the theories without participation. It is also doubtful whether the students can make use of the theories.
Another problem is the syllabus of the course. Since the teachers may not change the course syllabus every year, but the world changes every seconds, whether the theories they teach can keep up with the real world is a doubt. In fact, for subjects like science and technology, it is believed that practise is always more important than theories for many students since they will work on the real computer, or real machine, not on the book. If a student knows how to write a computer programme but they he cannot run this programme, it is still meaningless for him.
However, it is not accurate to say the university should not teach so many theories. There are many students who will have further studies in the future. Obviously, practical use is only the superficial level but it is even more important to know how one thing does to make improvement. This is the higher level of knowledge, therefore it is not fair to neglect those students who want to attain higher level of knowledge. University students should have more knowledge on certain subjects to make themselves different from lower educated people.
Although many people think that university is a place for students to develop their interest and prepare for future career, it is even more important for them to develop themselves, besides academic, to contribute to the society in the future. Anyway, university only provides parts of the training to them and should not bear all responsibilities for their preparation for the real world.

Television is very popular in nowadays' society, every family has at least one set of television.
Television has become a very important part of our lives many years ago. Television can brings us much entertainment, there are many programs for us to choose. Series TV programs, sports, music and so on. TV can make our life more interesting. We can also get much information from TV. We can know what happen around us and in the world through the news showed on TV immediately, we can know what product are popular with people through the commercial.
Every coin has two sides. TV can make our lives more colorful, but it can also bring us some troublesome.
As for children and pupils, their self-control are very poor, once they are watching something interesting, they will be fascinated by the program, and they will forget it's time for them to do their homework, if they do it for a long period of time, their study result will be worse and worse. In additional, some programs are not fit for children to watch, it may contains sex, violence, they are too young to differentia what they should watch and what they should not watch. Then parents should be their guides.
When you spend a lot of time in front of the TV and concentrated on the program, then you will have little time to communicate with your family or the people around you. The relationship will become estranged. It's supper time, all family members are sitting around the dinner table and having their supper, but maybe one of the members want to watch the series program that he watch every day, than he will bring his plate and bowl with him to the tea table in front of the TV, and watching the program while he is eating. The other members will talk about what happened to them that day, what they will do in the other day and so on. The one who is watching TV will lose a good chance to communicate with the families.
Spend a lot of time on TV, will less the time to get in touch with the society. Knowing what happen around you from the TV is not enough, you should go out and get the firsthand experience.
The one who likes watching TV, his ability to get on well with other people is poorer than the others, because he seldom contacts with others except the television. He will lose a lot of time on the TV and can do nothing else while he is watching the program. It may also harm to your eyes if you have watched the TV for a long time. Through some survey, the people who like watching TV, their reading abilities are much poorer than the others.
We can not deny that television bring us convenience to know what happen in our world and entertain us a lot. But we should control ourselves to use the television, and don't indulge ourselves in television.

Television is the opium of the masses in modern society, why? 
Nowadays, the television is a part of our life, which both benefit and harm to us. However television is still existing and quite popular among the households because people can benefit from it.
In modern society, we get much information from TV program. News, sports, amusement, even arts and culture of different country and zone. How 
Can we force television into opium? That's unfair. Television is great role of communication. Even if you are in China, in Japan or England you can also get news and appreciate movie, music and sports game out of your own country from the many different country.
In China, many families watch TV programme after their dinner, the funny comedy attract children, the sports game and amusement bring the youth and some adult great enjoy time, the news give many the adults and the youth people many new and surprising thing. So TV circles the family around and enjoys good time, how beautiful the thing is!
Maybe many businessmen get much information from the Internet, for example, the information for financial, banking and transportation and so on. Getting information from TV is more quickly and easier than from Internet. When you open your TV set you can watch anything what you want just change the channel and doesn't need to research like logging in Internet. Furthermore, the charge for the TV is cheaper than Internet. So, for the businessmen, TV is also the quickly and good way to get their information.
Additionally, if you are looking for a job, may be no need to research the boring catalogue from the newspaper or from the Internet web page. TV is ready to give you a hand to make you relax. Usually lots of companies input their vacancy information into the screen. I think that is the easy way to get your job, too. Sometimes maybe you don't know what thing is when you find the new type of goods that newly appear on the shop's window closet, but TV enjoys to show the way for you because the advertising company often give the introduction for new born articles. The usage, colour and price of the goods always are shown on the screen.
The benefit of TV is as many as possible so that I can't show it one by one in this limited essay. On the other hand, while TV gives so much benefit to people it do hurt people especially to the children and the youth. When children watch TV without the guide of their parents or adults, sometimes the horror movie hurt them. And sometimes the youth watch blue movie and some of violence, that's so bad, that give the youth the bad affection. So the TV administration has to manage the programme avoiding the programme to hurt children and the youth.
TV give us enjoy time, help us find job, report the news, it is so kind to us, how can we give it's a scandal like that-opium of the masses? Generally TV's benefit is the better than its badness. It is not opium; it is an important role for the information and communication. It is the interesting guy to show us the interesting thing.

Nowadays, higher education is regarded as the basic qualification to students who step into society since in recent decades, world economy have grown rapidly and the market competition have been getting serviously. What is more, higher education have generalised in developed countries, even thought in underdeveloped countries pay more attentions to enhancing people's education quality. Undeniably, university degrees is very important for students to improve their knowledge and skills as well as to adapt social development.
However, some people hold the opinion that most university degrees are theoretical and do not prepare students for the real world, therefore, it is of little value. The people hold that view may think that in reality everything is ever-changing while students still learn the outdated knowledge and skills sometimes are no longer suitable for the new situation. Moreover, all the theories are assumed in the ideal world and it probably completely does not work in real situation. While students spend three years or more on studying such unpractical skills. Some elder people might believe that the book or theory are written by the schoolar who have no any real practice or experience of the subject they are talking. even worse the tutors who also have no real experience learn from book and then transfer to students. Fortunately, there are many successful people who had not received higher education but they have successed . as a consequence, some people said that university degrees are useless in the real world.
Although the above opinion are descussive, most people consist on that university degrees are useful in reality. they argue that the degrees are the qualification of student. The theory is the guideline for student to improve their ability and who to do job well. Furthermore, in the real world, most company percieve degrees as criteria to recruit employees. If the candedates have no higher education background, they are most likely to throw these student's letter of application into bin. In addition, generally, the people who abtain higher education are more skillful and capable than the people who did not receive degree education, and the former people will be more comperhansive or real situation in the real world than the later people did. Nowadays, it is information ear. Technology and intellegence dominate the social and economic development. It is neccessary for student to educate in university to learn knowledge about the world. Then put it into practice. If someone have no such basic knowledge, he or she will highly possibly fall behind with social development and lose ability to compete with others.
In turn, university degrees is vital for students to enter into highly competitive society though the degrees are theoretical. Actually, in the latest decade, majority of successful people are well educated and experienced university life. In short, theoretical education is useful for students to persue the career.

Television is a necessary media for people in modern society. Most of people in the world have television in their home. As far as I know, some people think television is like the centre of masses that bring bad effect to our daily life. In my opinion, television brings us more useful and fast and good information than bad one.
Television is fully used by manufacturers to show their advertisements. Thousands of advertisements are on the television everyday. It is really a cheap and fast way for manufacturers to tell their consumers about their information. Because television can be seen everywhere in the world and it has large number of audiences. This means more people will know the goods and become their customers. This is also convenient for the customers who can know when the goods are on sale or have discounts. Furthermore, some words or sentences used in the advertisements are popular among people in daily life. People use them frequently and they become expressions of certain meanings. As the wide usage of them, linguists will put them into dictionary. This urges the development of linguistics.
Television is a tool by which people can know the things all over the world. It becomes a place where people from different countries communicate with each other. From the news on TV, we know the war in Afghanistan and the terrible attack in USA. We also know the 2008 Olympic Game will be held in China. It is terrible that people in one country just know the things of their own country. Businessmen could not export goods if they do not know what kinds of goods the customers need in the other side of the world. Government Official could not make political policies without knowing the current situation of other countries.
Some people think there are some adult programmes or films that are unsuitable for children to watch. It is true that some adult programmes are shown on television. However, those programmes or films are often be shown in mid-night or on the time when children are in bad, and usually a notice written on ""adult only "" will be underlined at the bottom of the screen.
Some parents think their children are addicted in the TV series shown on the television. This affects their study. Even a mother of a student said on a programme in the radio that her child was the best student in his school until he saw the TV series that were on from 6-8pm everyday. Is it the fault of television? In my opinion, children watch TV instead of studying is the parents ' fault. The duty of parents is to look after their children and teach them to do things rightly. There are many ways of avoiding children to watch TV and letting them be aware of the importance of study.
To sum up, television plays an important role in our daily life. It makes our life more convenient and colourful. Although some people think television bring bad effects to audiences and sometimes it disturbs their normal life, they should admit that they have benefited a lot since they have television.

Television is the opium in modern society, because it is important for some people. I will discourse this view in the following.
Television is one of all leisure. Everyday, the most people watch it that is important opium for some people, who waste a lot of time to watch it. I think that Television will destroy people's health and their developing and limit other leisure ways, but we can negative Television advantages and it's effect.
Firstly, Television is a passive product. People waste many times to watch it. If you watch it long time, your health will be destroyed, such as your eyes and your back and legs.
Secondly, everyone must life in real world; they need be work and their own developing. If you want to spend too much and possess luxury life, you must spend too many times to study new knowledge and developing your work, you can get some value and profit and your dream. It means that your must work hard and fitting real and competition world, if you cannot do that, finally, you will be eliminated, such as lost your work or bankrupt etc. So you must study and waste time to filling your knowledge gap and lack. The Television will affect your mind and limit your developing.
Finally, the Television that will limit other media developing, such as newspaper, radio, magazines and other media and spread ways.
Also the television has some disadvantages, but it has some advantages, that are other medias cannot instead.
First, the television can control some people mind, for example, the cartoon can control children, they will study cartoon language and active etc. so the good television will affect people ideas and their action.
Second, it is direct spread way, the people can get many news and people needs and life essential knowledge from television. Such as the weather forecast let people know how about tomorrow weather and if they need wear swear or get umbrella.
Third, the television is one of all knowledge spread. It can teach people lot of things and tell you how to do that and your questions. For example, you cannot cook food, but you want to make that, if you watch television, which can tell you how to make delicious food and your needs. The television can teach people many things and related knowledge, such as investment and how to make your profit and control market and stock theory.
Fourth, the people can stay home to watch film and some TV series; this is their entertainment ways. If you stay home to watch TV, let you feeling comfortable and relax, it can adjust people physics and relaxing people's tense mood.
To sum up, the television has advantages and disadvantages, for some people, the TV are opium, they are controlled. Everyday, when they go back home, first thing they must turn on TV. Actually they do not want to watch it, but this is behaviour. The TV let they relax and feeling comfortable, so they must do that. The TV is essential of their life. In modern society, it is necessary product and spirit food. So we say it is opium of masses in modern society.

In this time, there are one or more than one television in every family, so it is a popular intermediary tool, but someone thinks that the television is the opium of the masses in modern society, I do not agree with this view.
Firstly, we can know news. Though the newspaper can supply the news to me, the speed of supping the news is not fast, television can offer the news that day. For example, in Britain, BBC television station can provide the news of 24 hours ceaselessly, so we can know the newest news at the first time.
Secondly, we can know the knowledge outside of my country. In my country, some television programs show the custom, scenery, politics and economy of other countries. For example, because I want to study in UK, I know many informations about Britain, from these, I understand UK and know how to study or live there.
Thirdly, television can reduce the pressure. As we know, today is number time, so it needs the speed that people do anything, time is the money. Not only students study in the University, but also employees work in the company, their spirits are all tensely, after they finishing their work, they can choose different way to relax. Watching the television is a good way. Because one side, there are different program in the television, people watch the program what they interested, the other side, it needs not use your mind to watch TV, maybe you can sleep easily.
Fourthly, rising harmony of the family. My father is a businessman and my mother is a teacher, I am a student. Everyday we have each thing to do, none of us have the time or energy to go out at night. So every night we sit home and watch TV together. We enjoy watching TV and spending time together as a family.
However, watching TV can also have bad effects. Watching it too much causes your schoolwork to suffer. Watching TV instead of reading can hurt your reading ability and creativity. Also, violent TV shows make people more apt to use violence and eroticism, this kind of television program do not fit the young people. So you can see that TV is really a mixed blessing.
Some students do not hand in the homework on time or they are very tired when they having the class, not only these students, but also other people who has already worked, they wallow the television and have no energy to do other things, they only think about the television in their mind, so they waste many times for watching the television, and they have no communion with other people.
In a word, everything has both sides that includes good and bad, if only people do not wallow in the television, and choose right television program to watch on an appropriate time, television has many advantages and makes our life rich and colorful, so television is a necessary equipment of every family.

In the era of the 21st century, nearly every family has a television at home, in particular in developed countries. Television has played an important role in our daily life. Not only children but also adults like to watch it. There are many programmes of different nature showing on the television, including daily news, information programme, comic and programmes of comedy, horror and pornography.
Of these programmes, some of them are suitable for children but some of them are not. Therefore, it is very important for parents to choose suitable programmes for their children to watch. In fact, many parents do not allow children to watch television once their semester begins. Some of them might allow them to watch it for a short while only after they finish their homework. Of course, there are a number of reasons for parents doing it.
Firstly, children spend a lot of time on watching television without doing their homework, which will seriously affect their study. This is what most parents concern about. Secondly, children are quick learners. They can easily pick up some bad words or foul language from television programmes which may pose a problem to their grow-up if they do not have their parents to explain to them and tell them what they should avoid doing when they watch them. Apart from that, television could pose a problem for adults, too, as they might prevent adults from doing what they planned to do, in particular if they are watching a programme that runs daily and they do not want to skip any part of it and keep watching. It could be time-consuming as it hinders them from doing any other work.
With those disadvantages, why does television become so popular? Of course, there are many advantages that drive people to keep a television in their homes. Firstly, as the television provides us with programmes of different categories, people can find it easy to know what is happening in the real world and get up to date information from it so that they will not be lagged behind. This is particularly true to those wives who need to stay at home and take care of their children. Television programmes can also provide them with a common topic to talk with.
Secondly, many companies like to advertise their products on the television because they find it easy to get their products known to everybody as people of different ages watches television. And the most important point for producers is to gain a large market share for their products and increase their revenue in return.
Thirdly, television can help a lot when people feel bored or have nobody to talk to. People can be able to find a programme from a television which they enjoy most as there are a number of channels and programmes for them to choose. Besides, people can get current news from all parts of the world through television. It is particularly important for those who are working as journalists.
Although there are a number of disadvantages of television, television has become an important element in our life in this era of information technology, which we cannot live without it.

In modern society, there are many invention was simple to used by human
beings, such as computers, radios, washing-machines and so on. But
television is the most important thing that was became a part of human's
life, but there are number of people recognize that television is the
opium in our time. Now, I am going to discuss the advantages and
disadvantages of TV respectively.
Firstly, the advantage of TV, that is a convenient and common facility to
get information in time, for example, you can easily to know if something
was happen in your country or in the world, it is more lively to show than
newspapers and magazines. Secondly, television is also can bring kinds of
program to us in our leisure time, because the speed of people's life was
became faster and faster, it is a very good entertainment to relax, like,
teleplay, film, and sports. In many families, when parents and children
finished their work, they will sit together watch TV and have a delicious
dinner. What an agreeable thing is. It is not only can make people feel
relax and also a good way to kill time, TV can make people comfortable if
some people feel bore. Lastly, television is utility media framework, the
famous brand in the world no expect to use TV to propagandize their
products, how people define name brand, they pay attention to the brand,
but not the function.
We all know, when some thing was happened it must had the good side and
bad side, the disadvantages of TV is discussed by many people and become
more seriously.
Firstly, many people watch TV have no abstention, it is very waste time,
TV was a kind of opium for them, a dangerous hobby. One of my classmate
was failed his exams many times because of watch TV. I think they should
use time of watch TV to work to study, because watch TV just a
entertainment, but not a job, a course. Secondly, there is more and more
minor watch adult movie, and some program that was influence to them to
grow, such as, the program about sex, force and drug. Many cases were
indicated, like teenager were tried sex premature, the number of
bachelorette were increasing rapidly in every year, and problem of rape
for young people were became serious day by day, we can not say these
problems were all affected by television, but it must matter young people.
Not only this problem but also the drug for teenager, the age of acidhead
were lower year by year, commit crime of young people, like, dacoity,
murder and so on. Many of countries' government focus on this case.
Anyway, we can not say that TV is a sinful invention, I think we should
treat TV regularly, just regard it to a entertained tool, used it in our
leisure time, and watch the helpful program, TV also a great invention. I
hope those problems were occurred no longer.

Tiem passed quickly, human beings have entered the 21 century. Along with the development of technologies, more and more highly advanced electrical equipments have entered our daily life. Meanwhile, the condition of peoples life is becoming better than before. The income of people in most countries around the world has a dramatic increase during the past few years. For instance, more and more people in China can afford to buy private cars and houses. Based on the increase of money in the pockets, people can buy anything as they want. Television has become a part of people's family, and it is playing an important role on our life. Most families have two or even three televisions, which are put into each room. However, somebody thinks that television ahs become the opium of the masses in modern society, and a public debate has appeared on what is the role of television in our daily life and is that suitable to describe TV as the opium.
These are a lot of advantages that TV has. It is a good tool to transfer the information from all over the world to us. People can get a lot of news and useful information from TV. We can know what happened every day. Meanwhile, watching TV is a good way to relax mentally and phychologically after hard working at day time. People can choose a lot of entertainment programmes from TV, these are jokes, sports, music programmes, which are chosen by different people. Old people prefer to watch soap opera rather than watching sports. Young children and students can get knowledges by watching educational channels from TV.
Although watching TV has a lot of advantages, we cannot deny that these are some negative affects on this.
First of all, watching TV too much is bad for our health. It will hurt our eyesight. Some children always watch TV all the night in the same posture, and it is bad for their body to develop.
Secondly, watching TV is the waste of time. A lot of students watch their favourite sports and programmes instead of doing their homework. More seriously in order to watch football match, some students don't attend classes. They are addicted to watching TV and forget doing what they should do. It is the waste of their time and life.
As far as I am concerned, people should understand the good points and harm of watching TV. We should make full use of the functions of television, and get as much information and knowledge as possible. In modern society, television will benefit for people's life and supply more valuable information to us. It is a part of our life.

CNUK1099,2.5,2.5,,,,,Television is the opium of the masses in modern society. Discuss.,"
Someone claims that television is the opium of the masses in modern society. I think it is wrong because television programme can provided many useful information to us. Especially in some documentary programmes. We can learn a lot through this kind of programmes. News report also useful to us because we can know what happened everydays. We can understand what was happened in the rest of world. We can also learn a lot through television programmes. Although someone said that some TV programmes are absolutely nonsense and too simple for audience to watch. Such programmes make audience's mind become stupid because they always watch such rubbish programme. However, these TV programmes can give us a lot of fun and entertainment. It can help us to release our stress through watching TV. Some rubbish programme might be useful in other people view. Different people have different opinion. Some people claim that TV programme always follow same set of formula or pattern. It seems quite boring in their eye because the pattern of programme always the same. For example, the main character face some challenge or difficulties first, then the main character work hard and make progress, then the main charater overcome those difficulties or fail to overcome those difficulties. In love story, the main actor fall in love with other people, then he or she go to date, then they face some difficulties, then they overcome those difficulties, then they become a couple. However, it is a real life in many people view. This kind of story happens everydays. This is life. It is not a repetition because everybody experience this thing. The TV programme just reflect the real life. There are many kinds of TV programmes. Some programmes suitable for everybody, but some not. It is because it contain bad things such as violent, crime, sex, gamble and so on. This kinds of programmes make you feel unhappy after watching. Some people said that those programmes make people always thinking those crime in their mind. It makes people's mind and soul become bad. However, in the opposite side, it also reflect the real life and what happened in the society. It is also make people know that how bad of those crime. For example, the main actor who always did bad thing or crime. He or she will die or escape finally. It can let the audience think that is it good or bad for the main actor die or escape. It will make our mind become clear of the crime when we thinking this kind or TV programmes. This kinds of programme also reveal the real life of the society. It can be an educational programme in certain extend.
Some people said that watching TV is wasting time because audience need to watch everyday in order to follow the story. However, watching TV is also a kind of entertainment. It make audience feel relax and have fun when they watching TV. Many people like discuss the story of the TV programme. They will learn many through the discussion and they will understand much more of the programme. You also understand more what your friends think. This discuss also happen in family, parent will understand what their children think through discussion. It will help to narrow the generation gap between parent and children. Teacher can also use the TV programme to discuss in class. Students can learn many useful thing through discussion. It may be a case study. It is very useful in teaching I think.
Some people are very interested in the dialogue of the story. Some people often memorize some funny or useful dialogue of the story. It is very interesting when you say it to other people. It is quite useful in daily conversation. It is an art of conversation.
In conclusion, Television is not the opium of the masses in modern society.

Nowadays, televisions are very popular. Every family has at least one television - like my family, there are two television. People watch TV at home everyday. So some people will think television likes opium. But I don't think so. This is not the problem of TV set, but is ours.
Some people are just sitting in front of TV sets and watching it day and night, day by day. They are no working, no studying, no exercises, but just sitting and watching. In that case, that is harmful for their eyes, mind, and health. People will become good for nothing. Maybe after many years, the human beings will change another look that the muscle of butt will be strong, the others weak. But this is a problem in the future. Now, it makes their nation weak if everybody likes them, which indulges in watching TV.
But ""one coin has two sides"". Although it has some disadvantages, it also has its advantages.
TV sets could be said the great invention of Human Beings in the history. After invented it, people can know much news about his country or other countries as soon as possible. It makes people's life more convenience. People can transmit the live news very fast. For example, the US wanted to plan to fight to Iraq. The War of Iraq. It makes people pay more attention to the world news. If there is no TV set in this world, I can imagine that people how to get the news quickly. Maybe the Iraqis know the news the US flight to Iraq when the US launch the first missile. People have to wait the news for several weeks. They also can learn something when we are watching TV. Nowaday, many educational programmes are played everyday. There are many TV tapes about education and other things. Such as ""How to cook a fish?"" ""English debates"", some scientific experiments and so on. These things can improve our knowledge and our experiences of life. Sometimes, people can relax themselves too. In the modern time, people often work in the nervous environment. From getting up to back home, maybe they live under the pressure every time, every place. So they need to relax themselves. How to relax themselves? As we know, watching TV is a good and convenience way and many people choose this way to relax. It is convenience to turn on the TV and enjoy the programmes. Some funny programmes will make us grim from ear to ear. Maybe after watching TV, they will feel more relax and more comfortable, and then having a good sleep. Actually, there are many advantage about watching TV. So I don't think TV set is the opium.
Some people say TV set is the opium. Maybe they mean that people who depend on the TV sets very much. This is a problem of them. TV set, as an invention, hasn't advantage or disadvantage. The key point is people how to control themselves and how to spend the time in it. Some people watch it for a long time and day by day. That sounds terrible. This will delay their jobs, studies and something likes that. But some people watch it on order to relax or improve or know something about the world. They can spend fitable time in watching and learning something. They aren't no working, studying. They enjoy the TV sets. For them, TV set is the great invention. They also don't think the TV set likes the opium.

CNUK1102,3.0,3.0,,,,,Most university degrees are theoretical and do not prepare students for the real world. They are therefore of very little value,"
Why we must study hard in University now? That's because we all want to get university degrees which can help us to find jobs easier.
University degrees are thought very important in last century. That's why our parents always encourage us to study hard. All parents are expecting their own children can enter famous universities, after three or four years' study, we can graduate and get university degrees. Or even the postgraduate and doctor degrees. Maybe this is a tranditional thought, because university degrees are just one of the conditions we should possess. They don't mean every thing.
Why? First of all, our society is developing, people's attitudes towards university degrees have changes. When we go to an interview, of course, university degrees are very important. They can identify we did study in that university and learned certain kinds of perfessional knowledge. But it's very hard to judge if one person can comptent to the position or not. So what the bosses of the companies pay more attention to is the interviewees' work experience and ability.
For instance, two person go to interview the same position of Sales Department Manager. One of them just has a degree of regular course degree, but has some experience relate to that position. The other one has a degree of postgraduate but has no work experience. I think both of them are talented men. But may be the boss will chose the first one. As we know, what the company need is the person who can fit in with that position and start to work quickly, do things well and make decisions properly to help the company to earn more money. That's the efficiency in business world. Many people will say it's unfair. But it's a practical problem. That's the trend of the social development too. We can't change it.
On the other hand, there are competitions everywhere under the market economy. Expecially the competitions between companies are become more and more fierce. ""People are a company's great Assets."" So it's the competitions between people after all. University degrees can show our difference levels. But they don't mean all the things. Experience, ability and efficiency are all indisapensable to us.
Third, things are become more and more hypocritical in some fields. Many things can be false. So are the diplomas. Any one of us can get a false diploma by spending more money on it than the others do. I think it's a serious problem. If every one do so, what we students in university study for? What our society will be then? We dare not to imagine it.
We live in 21st century that is full of competition. University degrees are one of the things we should own, and other things like work experience, ability and effiency are also very important to us. All these conditions just like the organs of our bodies. While studying in University, we should not only learn perfessional knowledge, but also pay attention to train our synthetic ability to fit in with the development of our society in order to be the talented man that our country need. That's what we students really study for.
In brief, university just mean something, but not every thing. We should clean up our acts, develop ourselves overall and try to be perfect.

As we all know, the television become very popular to every families. I think the television can bring us some useful information to us. But it can also cause some problems.
Firstly, let me tell you something about the advantges. In nowadays, TV has become our major means of enterainment. We no longer go to the cinema or the theatre unless there is something special. It can save the times and money. From the TV, we can gain useful informations which we didn't learn in the books, we can also know many recent news about the home and the abroad. We can understand the home and abroad situation in time, we can also understand the good things and bad things in the society, they remind us that we should be more careful to the society.
OK, let me show you something about the disadvantages of the television. For one thing, some programs contained violence, sexy and so on, they will have very terrible effect to the children especially the teenagers. The programs will lead the teenagers to do the same things as the TV said. That may bring many criminal cases to the society. It is said that many children's criminal cases are caused by the television.
And the television may make the children's eyesight poor, they can not see the things clearly. Watching Television too much makes the children wear the glasses very early. It is bad for their health.
The television also bring some harms to the adult people, especially the women who are expecting. The X Ray from the TV may have a very bad effect to their unborn babies. It do harm to the mothers too. It may make them sick.
To the old people, they stay at home very long time to watch the TV. They lack of doing exercises. It will make them weak, and their body will feel pain.
I think the most important thing is that the television make people like watching TV too much. They couldn't leave the TV alone. One day, if they don't watch TV, they will feel very uncomfortable. It seems that they have lost something. But once they watch TV, they will feel very comfortable. Maybe I can call the television ""Mental Poision"". It makes the people lose the chance to enjoy the fresh air of the outside world.
And, watching TV too much may cause the waste of the power. It may cause the shortage of the power.
Some children like watching TV very much, they often watch TV without finishing their homework. That's very bad. The other day, they won't hand in their homework on time. It will delay their study.
Maybe I say too much disadvantages, but I just say out my own opinions about the television.

Stepping into the 21 century, science and technology has developed in leaps and bounds. Up till now, a set of television is no longer scarce towards most of the families.
Generally, television helps to improve the quality of our living standard.
It is a link to the world, which provides news around the world to us. Staying in our flat, we can easily know what is happening outside. Through the news reports, we can know the social affairs every day. Besides the local issues, we can also know things of various countries, even in other hemisphere. Also, news programmes is a channel letting us receive urgent, sudden but crucial news at once, such as the death of Princess Diana, the 911 incident and the election of US President.
It is popular for entertainment. People, especially those living in busy and crowded metropolis, they usually feel under pressure for their lives. When they arrive at home, relaxation is totally needed. Though people feel exhausted, they still can enjoy various sorts of programmes. All they need to do is to press the ""power"" button on! Programmes for entertaining including films, music, sports and game shows are broadcast to pander on various tastes.
Last but not least, it plays a role of education. Since the influence is wide, television channel becomes a usual tool of the Governments. For instance, during great occasions, departments concerned like to spread the greeting speech to the countrymen. Moreover, Education Departments produce series of educational programmes, such as ETV in Hong Kong, to enrich the knowledge of the students in academic aspects.
A coin has two sides. If it is used inappropriately, television will come to the opium in the modern society.
Due to tones of programmes from television channel, people may be addicted to the programmes, which becomes a habit in their daily lives. According to some medical surveys, some people can even spend a whole day to watch programmes from 8am to another day 2am. It is not a funny thing, but it happens. It is a waste of time! Hence, some parents dislike or prohibit their children to watch television.
Apart from the problem of timing, it also damages our health. When watching things more than a certain time, we need to let our eyes having a rest. Otherwise, their functions will get worse proportionally. Some educators claim the increase in the rate of wearing glasses is attributed to over television watching. Besides, people would rather sit and watch programmes instead of doing exercise, particularly young people. When we watch television, we do not need to do anything else except sitting in front of the black box. Let image if a person just sleeps, eats and watches television, he will easily get fatter and fatter within a short period. The obesity is now a fairly serious problem for many people in both western and eastern countries.
In my opinion, the invention of television is good or bad for human-beings depends on the way of usage. If we can have a self-control and use it in proper means, television, undoubtedly, should brings us lots of enjoyment.

TV has been popular with people without question since its invention. For TV provides a new means of entertainment, including diverse programmers that people can enjoy a variety of choices. It is not hard to understand, and yet because it is so appealing that people spend more and more time on TV, gradually they are addicted to it just like those to opium.
Opium, the definition in dictionary as we can see, is drag made from poppy seeds, used to relieve pain or to help sb to sleep. Why is TV equal to opium in modern society? Because nowadays TV is actually a commerce, which has been widely made use of as a business. As a result, profits becomes the purpose. Therefore, programmes are designed to cater for audience so that businessmen are able to earn more money by commercials. And audiences are likely to spend time dwelling on the so-called appealing programmes, in which people feel relief and kill time easily by such a good entertainment.
As for the audiences, they are provided with ideal life styles as imagined, yet in reality they are forced to face the inferior society. There they get frustrated from time to time and confront all kinds of unfortunes. Watching TV is a way to escape the reality. The effect is similar to opium to great extent that people can feel relief. Again and again, people are apt to addict to TV instead of facing the real life.
When people are addicted to TV, and escape reality by watching TV, encouragement for survive weakens. Meanwhile, they lose the ability to maintain the strength to read, which needs regular practice, while TV derivers things people don't have to analysis or ponder, that is to say, TV requires less effort than reading does.
Moreover, some audiences being addicted to TV have themselves addicted to the plots and imitate the behaviors of actors or actresses. Once there was a report saying a eight years old girl was about to hang herself when found and saved in time. Asked for the reason, she produced some words shocking all the people: ""because Xiao Yanzi did so as to get the permission to do sth."" Xiao Yanzi was one time a very popular actress for her acting in Huanzhu Gege. And the TV series were well received. The incident elicited a debate, i.e. whether the TV series are colorful pudding or spiritual opium? This derived from alternative reactions to the popularity of the TV series. Anyway, it did harm the masses as a fact.
Reflect to TV itself, what on earth are the original functions? Undoubtly, people know it well that TV offers information, education and entertainment as well. Such as BBC, whose operation for non commercial, at the same time, it is one of the top TV companies throughout the world. For upright programmes can also win attention as long as they are good enough. And the role it plays is the leader of advanced culture. However, in modern society, TV acts as opium that mave people addicted to it with the ability and encouragement declined, even envenom people themselves and the people related.

Television has become one of the necessities of modem society. There is one television, sometimes even two, in almost every family. People spend hours sitting before the TV sets, laughing along with the laughter of the characters in the TV series, crying with their cries. They are so absorbed in the programs that they pay no attention to the surroundings. They watch TV as if they are taking opium. In fact, television is the opium of the masses in modem society.
Opium is a strongly addictive narcotic drug made from poppy seeds, used to relieve pain or to help somebody sleep. Addiction and anesthesia are the characteristics of opium. They are also the characteristics of television.
Before the invention of anesthetic, opium had been used as a kind of narcotic by doctors during operations. A small amount of opium did little harm to human bodies but help patients to relieve the pain caused by operations. So does television. Television plays an important role in people's daily entertainments. People watch TV series, music videos and funny shows after work for relaxing. They sit in the sofa, enjoy their favorite programs and let go of vexations. Television is also an effective medium for information. People get to know the information all around the world by the way of watching TV. ABC News tells them how the war in Iraq is going on. The Discovery Channel shows them the picture of the pampas. Advertisements widen their choices over the products. Even if they are living in the Eastern Hemisphere, they can know what exactly is going on in the Western Hemisphere. For instance, on September 11th, 2001, the phoenix TV broadcasted the news that America was under terrorist attacks just several minutes after the attacks. The dire pictures that the World Trade Center collapsed and people ran away with fear could also been seen on TV by all the Chinese.
However, taking too much opium is addictive. Watching too much TV is addictive as well. Take the TV series for example.. Once people begin to watch the TV series, they cannot help watching it every day or every week. They want to know whether the hero has broken up with his girlfriend, or whether the heroine has found her ideal husband. They care more about the lives of the characters than that of themselves. That's because the characters are experiencing something that will never occur to them. People work hard every day to earn money so as to support their families, but they are bored with the
working routine. They expect something unusual, so they watch TV series to fulfill their dreams. That's why the story of the prince and the Cinderella is so popular and all the popular stories have happy endings.
Anesthesia is the other characteristic of television. That's to say, people are becoming more -and more unconcerned about their surroundings. People turn on TV immediately they reach home, then they are engrossed in the programs. They say no words to their families, even though they are sitting in the same sofa and watching the same program. Some families watch TV even during meals. The sounds of TV have taken place of the chatting among the families. In this way, communications between family members are diminishing.
After all, television does much less physical harm to human beings than opium does. But we cannot neglect its negative effects. It is a good medium to get information, but watching too much TV is like taking too much opium. You will be too addicted to get out.

University degrees have become a hottie topic in our country through our daily life. Whoever have entered or is going to step into university would probably take it into everyday conversations. Most people, nowadays, think that a large quantity of university degrees are too theoretical and do not prepare the students for the real world. Thus, in their opinion, university degrees are of little value. That definitely exists in our society. For instant, more and more college graduates found that they themselves lack of abilities to do certain things in the practical issues. Therefore, companies are singing more highly at the abilities and mastered skills during the process of the real work. Such thing results in a very serious problem - the enhancement of the unemployment among the university graduates.
However, the viewpoint based on the fact mentioned above that university degrees are of little value is somehow one-sided. In my point of view, I could not agree more that university degrees are theoretical but I have to admit one thing, that is, instead of uselessness, university degrees are helpful to the real work. For one thing, theoretical knowledge plays an important role in the real work. It is the fundemental things during the work process. An individual who have learnt some theoretical knowledge would perform a better work than those never have any. That is also the reason why companies want to employ those better-educated person. On the other hand, the theoretical knowledge gives the college graduates the opportunities of the skills developments and position enhancements. Thanks to the basic theories in a specific field, after gained lots of experience from their practical work, an individual should upgrade himself/herself very easily and quickly. As we all know, theory and concept come from the abstraction of the practical things, thus theory and concept leave a large room to extend or so. In this circumstance, people who comprehend the theory may sometimes get a creative idea, which give them the potential of skills developments and position enhancements. Nevertheless, theoretical education provides a room for an individual to go further in his/her own study. Got the university degrees, there are also a great number of people would go to their further studies. A well mastering of theoretical basics can absolutely serve such an end.
All in all, as undergraduates, we should not negate the function of university education. What we should do is to make good use of the university degrees we received Firstly, we must pay more attention to the theoretical studies during our college life--studying bard, and going deeper into the learning objects. Secondly, we bad better to put the theoretical things that we learnt from courses into practice. That is the only way we can match theory and the real. Only if paying attention to this practice, we would have narrower gap between theory and the real. The last thing we should do is to try our best to open our eyes and broaden our horizon, which is the only solution to the world's knowledge explosion.

In modern society, people are surrounded by much information, and medias like television are playing an essential role in our lives. Without television, people would find it a little bard and can't get used to it. However, television is very different from opium. In contrast to opium, television has much obvious good for people.
First of all, watching television has become the major way of obtaining entertainment That is to say, by watching television, we can broaden our minds, catching up with the modem world's pace, and have much fun. On the other hand. taking opium results in the damage of our health, both physically and mentally. Dating backing to our humiliating history of being invaded during the Qing dynasty, the British empire used the opium as the weapon to destroy our nationals and earned much money. People who have taken opium can't live without it, if so, they will feel very terrible like cold, powerlessness and etc. Taking opium is like the chronic suicide. Most opium takers can't not stop until they are dying except a very few determined people who have succeeded in giving up through bitter experience. In many people's hearts, television has become the symbol of happiness in family's life. We can see many children gathering around television watching their favorite programs by the company of parents.
Secondly, television will not let people being addicted to it. While people have spare time, they can enjoy their favorite programs. But if they are busy, they will forget it and being engaged in their jobs. I have learned from many hard working people that even though they like to watch TV, but if they have emergency to deal with, they will totally forget about it Contrary to this, opium has very bad effects and control people not to leave from it People who regret and want to give up will get punishment and probably give in at last 
Finally, we can learn from television with much useful information. In nowadays, transportations are very convenient and the information can spread to die world's every comer in a short time. So from watching T~ we can know what happened and get much information. The media can report news promptly and detailed to audiences. We can share much information with people.
Television has given us so much fun and knowledge, we can not live without it in modem society. However, this has total different meanings with opium.

Television has been brought into families for tens of years. At first, only few programs could be watched on it. It is the time when TV set was used mostly as a machine of entertainment. The advertisements could be seen only occasionally. When it came into modern society, television is the opium of the masses, though most of people have been unconscious of it. Both adults and children can not escape by sheer luck from the poison of television. When they are watch rubbish programs on TV set, they are misled; they are cheated; they are wasting their lives and energy. Unawares, they are poisoned.
For adults, TV set plays a role in their lives mostly as something killing time. It makes them tired to work, to study, to compete with others in modern society during daytime. While they go home, the best thing to do maybe is watching TV with a cup of tea in the hands, which makes them feel ease. However, they are not aware of the harm of doing this. Firstly, because they are tired out, they have almost no strength to select information sent off by television. And because they do not select, they are easy to be misled which is fully used by the advertisers. Time between 7 o'clock and 9 o'clock is called ""golden time"", not only because it is the time when more programs are available but also for manufacturers, it is the best time to promote their products. The effect of advertising during this time is obvious. If advertisements are cheating, it hard for people to prevent themselves from believing it, for their brains do not work as hard as daytime. Long time to watch TV make them feel more confused. Secondly, to some people, television is their friend who can help them to escape from the real world. For such ones, lives are boring. They are not satisfied with it , but have no ability to have a change. So , they place hope on TV. TV provide them a world full of imagine, despair that it is impractical. That can explain why in many countries soap operas are very popular.
Then, it comes to the harm which is done by television to children. To some degree, most children of this era are victims of TV. They are influenced by it from their births and the influences go with them as they grow up. As an 
effective way of broadcasting, TV can not decide what kind of information can not be sent off. That is to say, it depends on children themselves to select information. However it is hard and impractical for them to do so. They are not sensible enough to control themselves unless they grow up and experience more. The younger the children, the deeper and easier they are affected. It is TV that tells they what is violence, what is war, what is power, and what is money. The teenagers are good at copy. Because of their curiosities, once they know a little they want to know more. So , it is time for them to concentrate on TV set. They do not want to study, only prefer violent games, know nothing about manners, while shout to others rudely. It is hard for them to get rid of such bad habits once they are used of them. This is bad enough for their education even the future.
No matter adults or children, television makes them hardly communicate with family members, so much so that family conflicts turn up and become one of social problems of modern society. Without TV set we can still play, walk, live, and breath. Television brought us nothing good enough. It is the opium of the masses.

After television has been invented, it soon became the most popular form 
of entertainment all over the world. It just likes the opium that makes people to be slaves of it. However, few people realized the problem. Television does not look as if it will be less popular in the world of the future. Instead, it seems that it will become more popular. Therefore, the problem becomes more serious.
We cannot deny that television provides us a more convenient way to get the latest information, but we also have to admit that television is the opium of the masses in the society. There are many disadvantages of television. For one thing, nowadays, most families have at least one television. They watch TV whenever they are at home. Take myself as an example, there is a television in my room. Once I entered the room, I would turn on the television at first no matter what program was on show. It seems to me that television is one of the necessities in my daily life. When I am bored and tired, all I need to do is just to turn on the television and to be given passive entertainment. Also if you were stuck on a TV program, you would watch it everyday whether you were busy or not. It is the same that if you have tried the opium you could never quit the habit.
Secondly, television killed people's own creativity and made them lazy. The viewers usually make no judgement and accept everything presented to them from the television. Though many programs are educational and introduce people to things which they may not know before. However, it makes viewers become receptive and unquestioning. Also it makes viewers become lazy and lack of exercises. The viewers need to do nothing. They do not even have to move if they have a remote control. Most people stayed at the seats for several hours watching TV. Television takes up much time of a person and makes him lazy. Beside a person's health, television may also have bad effect on your family. Since you spend more time on television, you may ignore your family and be lack of communication with your relatives. It likes the opium which not only has bad effects on a person's health, but also on his/her family.
Also some TV shows can be harmful to children. Many advertisements are written to create a desire to children for unnecessary products. Besides, some programs that include violence or sex give children confusing and misleading ideas. To some degree, television is like the opium of the children which affects them badly.
On the whole, television is the opium of the masses in modern society. It makes you stuck on it, does harm to your health and family, and has bad effects on children's mind. It seems that we are becoming the slaves of television. However, we have to avoid this result being come true. What we should do is to regard television as our assistant, not our master.

A saying goes like this"" Television, the opium of the masses in modern society."" In recent years, people are influenced greatly by television, which is marked by rapid change and growth. There are good influence but also bad influence. For instance, some people commit crime under the influence of television violence. However, television has been a medium of the masses. Especially during those years, television has been the major source of news, information, and entertainment. Now television is moving into a new era of extraordinary versatility, which promises to reshape our lives and our world. We get so used to being with the giant medium that we take many advantages of television.
First of all, television is the major source of news. We are used to sitting in front of the television at our dinner time every night, hearing the familiar voice of the evening news. We would like to get big news from television at the time because we could not only hear but also see what is happening on television, which is much better than reading newspapers. My grandmother, who is interested in politics, watches the evening news of CCTV for nearly twenty years. And she has got into the habit of watching the evening news everyday, which has become a necessary part of her life. Besides my grandmother, many people must be used to getting information from the television news.
In the second place, we get a lot of information from television. Only from television, we know visually from the updated products in television commercial to the latest science research in Discovery program. In the age of television, reading books is not as important as it once was. People can learn as much by watching television as they can by reading books. A friend of mine keeps watching a series science program on television. And she said it benefited her a lot and thanked to the television, the high technology in the program appeared to her so vividly that it was not boring at all. What's more, we could learn history from television, which is proved to be a effective way.
Because seeing the documentary of history just like watching a movie, which is more interesting than reading a book.
Last but not the least, we relax ourselves by watching the entertainment programs on television most of the time, such as soda show, television series, MTV, and movies, etc. Recently, a report on newspaper indicates that entertainment is the second purpose for people to watch television besides news. And MTV program is appreciated by a number of young people. After all, television is the best multimedia for entertainment and can not be replaced by any other media.
All in all, television, like other things, has both advantages and disadvantages. The most important for us is to realize that television in itself is neither good nor bad. Therefore, we should take in the useful information and be critical to some controversial information from television program. If we make good use of television, it will not be a opium of masses but a good servant for us in modern society.

Television you watch every day, your secret best friend. is an addictive opiate. and not only that, it's one of the most potent mind control devices ever produced. This technology product does act as drug. It is what society offers to make up for what has been lost. Not only is it available. hut also it is that keep you from knowing that there's anything else available. It's easy to see why people go for those things and why they become addicted to them, because each one offers some element of satisfaction. Watching television keeps you from thinking about other things, it tells the time, it provides ""entertainment"", it can make you laugh sometimes. It tells you a little bit about what seems to be happening in the world, although it discourages any relationship you might have to it Now if you're asking how we might change that pattern. I can only say that you have to create alternative visions; you have to get people to experience what they've lost.
Now television, of course, is also deeply engaged in this ""co modifying"" process, the purpose being to commodity feeling, consciousness, desire, awareness. The human mind has already been grist for the mill even before the genetic structure and space. Consciousness has already been reshaped to fit and accept the co modification of nature. The invasion of the mind happened a long time ago. The reshaping of the mind is what advertising is there to do. Television does this. The media does this. These are more effective tools than we used to have. Advertising enters human feelings and offers them up in images. Are you pretty enough? Are you cool enough? Are you lively enough? 
When you're watching television the higher brain regions are shut down. and most activity shifts to the lower brain regions. The neurological processes that take place in these regions cannot accurately be called ""cognitive. The lower or reptile brain 
simply stands poised to react to the environment using deeply embedded ""fight or flight"" response programs. Moreover, these lower brain regions cannot distinguish reality from fabricated images, so they react to television content as though it were 
real, releasing appropriate hormones and so on. Studies have proven that, in the long run, too much activity in the lower brain leads to atrophy in the higher brain regions.
Yes, television bas worked wonders in the world spreading information and, even, hope into countries and cultures notably lacking in both information and hope. Yes, as McLuhan saw and foresaw, television has not only extended our senses (at least our visual and auditory senses) to the ends of the earth and beyond, but has also taught our eyes to see and comprehend faster and faster.
But: When television becomes omnipresent and obsessive, as it is now, it is nothing more or less than a true Lethe Lite. A lovely, seductive never-ending electronic river of forgetting.
Turn it on, tune it in, and forget. Only disconnect from the world Only connect to the evanescent, empty image. Only cease paying attention to the world Heed only the glowing lines, the dancing dots of color. Sleep the sleep that does not knit up the raveled sleeve of care. Unsweet dreams for a planet in full flight from the kind of true connecting that Forster had in mind. Unsettled rest for a race of compulsive inattentive.
Television: the technology to legitimize Attention Deficit Disorder for everybody. At the moment of true death, of what value will the memory of those thousands of hours of TV-watching be?

Television has become popular since the 1980s. At the first beginning, people are proud of owning a television. In their eyes, television is a small world from which they can learn a lot such as the current affairs, the secrets of the nature, the advantages of high-technology, etc. With the fast development of society and technology, various new televisions have been produced. People now pursue more than the television itself but the high quality enjoyment. Although other high-technology products are coming out endlessly such as the computer, the passion people like television seems never descend at all. At the same time, more programs can be received even they are million miles away by the satellite communications, which get television can be make most use of. However, some people spend too much time on watching TV that someone start to doubt that television is the opium of the masses in the modern society.
In their opinions, televisions are too widely used that some people are indulge in the programs. For example, such people may stay up late to watch a football match, or may turn on the TV as soon as they arrive home, even sit in front of the TV for a whole day in holidays. Sometimes they would sit before the TV at the same time everyday in order to watch a long TV play series. And if they miss one collect, they may feel pity and get annoy. What is worse, they are unwilling to go to WC in the middle of the play to prevent missing any exciting plots or will quarrel with their family members for different programs. For them, TV is the opium without which they must feel uncomfortable all day. They take television as an important part in daily life rather than a tool through which they can learn knowledge. They just want to kill time and they can hardly control themselves.
Fairly speaking, watching TV for fun, and to relax stress in busy daily life is undoubtedly one major function of television. But the problem is how to use it correctly. It is praiseworthy that those people who are crazy about television are only accounted for a small part in the audiences. Most audiences, however, are quite rational towards TV. They choose the programs valuable; spend necessary time on them; and try to be the owner of TV but not the slave. of it. For them, television is a tool to get information and learn knowledge rather than a ""box"" for entertainment. What is more, modern life is much more colorful than before. People travel, go to the cinemas, surf the internet in their spare time. Television is no longer the only thing they concerned, which makes it lack of implicit advantage in modern society to some degree. In this sense, it is quite ridiculous to say that television is the opium of masses in modern society.
All in all, television is produced by human beings. Human should surely benefit from it instead of being harmed. When it becomes the opium, television would have been destroyed. Luckily, such things never happen in the whole society, which makes us to believe that television would be more valuable and the future of it would be brighter.

What would you love to do at first when you back home? Play computer, listen to music or read newspaper? Maybe a large amount of people prefer to watch television for relaxation after the whole day's tiring work. Undoubtedly, television has already played an important part in people's lives. In other words, we can say that television has become an essential piece of furniture in a house just like a chair or a bed. Although television is so popular, there are many issues on its function and influence. Some people said that television has done much harm to the modem society, and even regard it as the opium of the masses. Of courses, when a person is once addicted to television, it will do nothing helpful to him. But does not television have a single redeeming feature? The answer is utterly negative.
Above all, television is absolutely different from opium, because it has brought many benefits to human. Opium is a kind of poison. Nearly all the people who have ever tried it will be addicted to it. Then they will feel very uncomfortable without it. The most harmful thing is that the opium will hurt both people's body mental. On the contrary, the fact that television has wildly spread all over the world has justified its use and goods. Imagine life in the past without television: you can no longer watch news and a football game as easy as today; going to the library may be the only way to get information about the foreign countries; knowing the latest news is almost impossible by reading newspaper. In one word, television makes the world become closer and closer. Maybe you will say that we can use other technology, such as the internet, instead of television. But the internet only develops quickly in recent years and it is not yet perfect enough to make it take television's place. Therefore, television has promoted the world's development to a certain extent.
In addition, the evidence which people use to reject television is utterly groundless. The most popular one is that people, especially children, are easily obsessed by television. Also someone said that some of the programs on television will mislead the youth. All these ideas which believe that all the problems are caused by television are foolish. Television is a kind of technology and it can not do any harm to human by itself. Only when it is used by human, can its disadvantages and advantages be reflected. That means, television itself has no fault, because what kind of programs should be broadcasted or watched is decided by people. So what we should do is to avoid its disadvantages. For example: the government should work out some rules for television media; the TV companies' behaviors should be more socially responsible; parents should give more guidance to their children.
So, please stop putting all the blame on the television. People should undertake the obligation themselves. Because it is not only the government and TV companies that need to play an important role in this field, but everyone should take a correct attitude to the television and even try to benefit from it.

TV has been created more than one hundred year. During the 100 hundred years, more progress has been made, and it really broadens the sight of human beings. The invention is one the biggest devotion to the civilization of human. But as time goes on, television has shown more defaults to the residents, not only in one single country but also in the whole universe. So to be specific, television is the opium in the modern society.
To begin with, television has bad influence on children. If you inspect what the students do first when they come back from school carefully, you will find that they do nothing except opening the television. Do not they have assignment to finish? The answer is negative. They have a lot of work to do, but they do not go to their desks before they appreciate the program on TV. To the children, the flash or cartoon on television are more attractive to them than anything else. They learn some words and some behavior which are not suitable to them. What's more, they attempt to try this words and behavior in their real life. So the television is the biggest inducement of juvenile delinquency. Some short sights are also caused by watching television frequently.
Secondly, television also will cause quarrel among family members, for with the development of modern technology, the programs are too many to choose, Different family members want to select their favorable program, and at the same time, the other ones want to choose their favor. How to settle this problem down. Complication maybe will rise among them. So television is bad for improving the feelings of family member rather than good for. And sometimes it will destroy the relationship between neighbors. For example, Mr Wang prefers watching television in midnight to sleeping. And his neighbor Miss Li is a traditional person who will go to bed at eleven o'clock sharp. So she finds it is very hard for her to sleep when Mr Wang is watching movies on televisions. She does her best to persuade Mr Wang to turn down his television, but fails. At the end, she cannot bear it. What should she do? The only one method is to break the friendship with him, and accuse him of infesting her at midnight. In a word, it is the television that makes that incident happened.
Then, television becomes the tool of some companies to advertise. They spend a lot of money on advertisements, actually the achievements of them are not very good, in order to enlarge customers, they do advertisements crazily. And this will mislead the customers' choice. When people go into to store to buy shampoo, they find that all the brands on the shelf all have ever appeared on television advertisements. They feel at lost, maybe they go back with nothing, and maybe they will take a new brand which they do not familiar with. All of this is contributive to television.
All in all, television indeed brings a lot of things to people, and broadens people's sight. But nowadays, television is abused, which make it becomes opium in modern society.

CNUK1125,3.5,3.0,2.0,3.5,1.5,1.5,Most university degrees are theoretical and do not prepare students for the real world. They are therefore of very little value,"
Every student dreams of the life in university in that the colorful activities and enjoyment of complete freedom are impossible to be found in Senior High School. However, viewpoints on university degrees vary from person to person. Some people hold the opinion that most university degrees are theoretical and do not prepare students for the real world. Others are against it. I firmly oppose to the standpoint that university degrees are useless. .
From my point of view, for one thing, I should concede a point that most university degrees are theoretical indeed. Nevertheless, we have to analyze it carefully. Because we must get to know a major and have a good command of it within four years, limited time only allows us to accept the basic and essential theory. On the other hand, we obtain knowledge mainly from books, references and lectures that are available on campus; therefore, theoretical knowledge is the chief characteristic of undergraduates. In other words, less chances to get in touch with society and to bridge gap between theory and reality make most university degrees are theoretical.
But this feature does not signify the little value of university degrees. Theory and practice are something equally important. Even though more emphasis is put on theory rather than practice in university, it would certainly prepare students for the real world. There is no doubt that correct theory is the guidance for practice. Without theory, we are highly likely to steer our efforts in a wrong direction. Of course, it is very necessary that theory and practice should be closely connected. But the main task of study in university is to lay a solid theoretical foundation for our further development in the future. Just as Roma city cannot be built in one day, so is our future. People have different and particular tasks in specific phase of our life. In university, the purpose of our study is a good mastery over basic theory relevant to our major. Meanwhile, we also should try hard to extent our knowledge and enhance comprehensive ability. Only on the basis of theory, can you establish an overall framework of your future. Otherwise, your future would be easy to be shaken, or even be thrown into a state of collapse.
On the whole, despite of the fact that most university degrees are theoretical, they are of great value and use for people. They not only prepare students for the later practice in society, but also prepare them for a better future through cultivating their scientific thinking pattern and ability to analyze any information that may come along. Given a large number of limitations to teaching in university such as time, fund, technology, human resources, providing students with a theoretical foundation along with enough experience towards society is somewhat demanding. In my opinion, more opportunity to get to know society can be created by students ourselves. More importantly, we should be well aware of the importance of taking the advantage of university to achieve ideal academic performance.

With no doubt, television plays a greatly important part in the daily life. But whether it is good or not is still controversial. Some people consider the television as the opium of the masses in modem society, and the opinions are as follows.
Primarily, television does harm to people's health. According to the investigation, the radiation from the television damages cells in a way that is potentially cancer causing. Even if the radiation is controlled in a secure limit, the screen will also hurt people's eyesight. Nowadays, more and more children become short-sighted mainly because of 'watching TV'. Based on some data, seventy percent of 18-year-olds and half the 12-year-olds are myopic. And worse still, up to 10 percent of myopic children will wear glasses of at least 700 degrees by the time they are 12. Therefore, it is obvious that television is a threat to tens of thousands of families.
Moreover, television provides too many horrible things for the audience, especially for the children. Violence and pornography can be seen in the programs here and there, leading to a fairly bad impact on children's mind. Although such programs will give warning before their performance, most of the time, children will not change the channel owing to their own curiosity. In recent years, the trend of youth crime has been increasingly apparent, which undoubtedly relates to the unhealthy content from the television.
Last but not least, television estranges the relationship of the family members. Everyday when people go home, their first action is pressing the button of the television. And later soon, everyone will be addicted to the programs regardless of what happens around. In this case, the family time will surely be lessened, and the communication between parents and the children will be more difficult accordingly, which is not good for the harmony of the families as well as the growth of the children. Despite the unfriendly attitude towards the television, there is another opinion of this controversy.
In the first place, as far as many parents' concerned, the television is an attractive bait to the children so that they will not stay outside without trace for the whole day. In spite that not all of the programs are suitable, there are also good choices for children on television. And then it relies on the parents to give their children a correct guide. General speaking, parents prefer their children to stay at home even if they are just indulged in watching television. Anyway, compared with the quiet home, the outside world is actually much more ominous than what is presented in the programs.
Secondarily, television brings a lot of happiness to human beings. Living in such a fast-pace society, people have to find some ways to relieve their pressure. In this case, television offers lots of entertainments to the audience. People can listen and look whatever they want in various programs, which will make they feel more relaxed after watching them. A report says that eighty percent of people consider television as the first option when they need recreation.
What's more, television is a bridge connecting individual to the outside world. Through television, people can know what happens in the world; through television, people can get in touch with many a new thing and learn a variety of knowledge; through television, people even can go anywhere they like around the earth. In short, television broadens people's vision and brings quite a lot of convenience to the daily life.
In a word, one can never make an affirmative conclusion that whether the television is good or not. But for one thing, if television occupies all your time without offering any valuable thing, the best choice is to press the 'close' button.

In China, University degree is very important to student, especially to graduates. They need the degree to find their job. University degree is one of the most important criterions to graduates. If graduates have not university degree, they might have not a 
chance to be invited in a good job.
Every year, there are thousands upon thousands teenagers hope they can enter a good university. And when they got that, they may have not to study so hard as they in middle school, but they must get the degrees in university. Most university degree are theoretical and do not prepare students for the real world. So how valuable the university degree is! Different people have different opinions. In my opinion, university degree has little value in society.
University degree is not an ability, which everyone knows. The ability of work includes several aspects, like professional knowledge, communion with partners, the ability of creativity and so on. Many complicated work need various abilities, which will not be found in old textbooks. But university degree just proves someone has the professional knowledge and someone have past the examination at school. In fact, I doubt if the university degree can really prove the student have the professional knowledge, or they only have the good ability of passing examination. In the practice of work, sometimes, theoretical knowledge that studied at school is helpless.
It is just a paper to some people. Nowadays, there are many successful people who have not any university degrees. They still have their own success. Perhaps the university degrees have a little help in their work, but that is not the decisive ingredient for their success. There have a fact about graduate, more and more university graduates in society can't find the job, one the one hand, it shows the job competition increase, on the other hand, it shows the university graduates have not 
equally ability as their degrees. Every graduates need to realize that university degree is not a golden bowl for their whole lives. The best way is to improve them constantly.
University degree would be a restriction for people's development. In university, students have their specialty. And the specialty decides their direction in future or not. They have to learn the professional knowledge to get scores, if they haven't enough scores they can't get the university degrees, meanwhile, they lose the time and chance to find and study what they really want. Professional knowledge can made them more specialized, but it is also can make their horizon more narrow. Many university students are short of society and life knowledge, this is the failure of education.
We can't disavow most of the jobs need the people who have the university degree. In a sense we believe that was unfair. Thus someone who has genuine ability and learning lose the opportunity. Although we know the university degree has little value, this fact cannot be changed immediately. To be the university student, we should make our effort to make the degree more value.

Most of the people in the world have a TV set in their homes and, according to the experts, we rarely turn it off. As a matter of fact, TV takes up more and more of our time. Yet the television still provokes controversy. Some even consider it as the opium of the masses.
TV does undeniably have its disadvantage. So many families spend whole evenings in front of the screen. Family members fix their eyes on the box rather than communicate. Once people come back home, they flop down in front of the TV, and only communicate with TV. It is too sad that TV programs are becoming a substitute for family life. It is so sad that family members simply do not communicate.
Besides, the happiness of the youngsters can also be affected by television. Since every member of the family prefers to pay attention to television, youngsters are neglected. They also pick up to spend their time on the magic machine. Time that should be spent in studying now is spent in chasing after TV programs. Even when in class, children seem hard to concentrate on their study.
Still worst, more and more TV programs contain sex and violence. In this case, television is really not a good thing to glue to, neither for families nor youngsters. All these contents may cause anxiety and horrors. Youngsters are beyond the ability of control. Without guidance, they could not keep themselves away from sex and violence. It is even indicated that these kinds of programs tempt youngsters to break laws.
Yet, there are two sides to every thing. For those elderly, lonely or bedridden, housebound, television is a friend. It is so cheep and convenient that it becomes a blessing for those people. It is a form of entertainment for them. Watching television can be an ideal way to relax. Television brings in color to those people's life. They do not have to face with the empty and dull room alone since they get a friend named television.
Of course, television is not just entertainment. It can be informative. People get information from television programs. By some educational programs, people can even learn at their spare time in a comfortable way. It may also popularize some new information. We can catch up with the world by the latest news and information television provides.
What is more, television can provide a source of good family conversation. Family members talk about programs they see on the screen. They communicate their opinions on the programs. Parents and children have more to converse owing to the television programs they see. With the entertainment that television provides, family members have more interests and hobbies in common.
Television is banal and boring. Television is nasty and violent. Television is informative and useful. Television is relaxing and entertaining. Television is all of these. We should watch television selectively in order to prevent indulging with it. It can be part of our life. But when it takes up too much of our time, it is not television to be blame for being the opium. It is we who should take the responsibility to turn it off.

CNUK1134,3.0,4.0,,,,,Television is the opium of the masses in modern society. Discuss.,"
I am going to discuss the topic that television is the opium of the masses in modern society. I disagree that television is the opium of the masses in modern society. Though television has its own disadvantages, in my opinion television brings us more gains than pains.
Firstly, television speeds up the steps of globalization. Television makes the world smaller and people closer to each other, whatever news and information are transported all around the world quickly and truly by television. The whole word is no longer divided into several fragmentary lands by its geographic condition, for the reason that television has joined the continents together. People can communicate with others extremely easily, even with ones owning different skin color or speaking different languages.
Secondly, television is a tool for promotion. Countless advertisements are being put on the television every minute. These various advertisements waken people's desires to purchase goods. To some extent, television is a modern promotion worker, who lives in every family and promotes goods in every minute. As a result, a plenty of cash are thrown into the market more frequently, and that contributes a lot to the development of the economy. On the other hand, television is showing its power in politics. 2004 is the election year of the United States and television advertisements are announced frequently. Television debates are supposed to be followed more and more hotly until the election ends. All of these have a lot to do with the final result of the election.
Thirdly, television plays a very important part in our daily life. Not only is it considered to be one of the most important ways for people to obtain information, but also designed for our entertainment. Without television people would live in a complete ill-informed world; without television people around the earth would not able to watch the splendid Olympic Game; without television people would not have seen how the war was going on in Iraq.
Unlimited knowledge about other countries and their culture can be found through the television quite conveniently on different channels leading audiences to different areas. For instance, National Geographic offers all kinds of information about nature, history, culture and so on, giving the audiences a much wider view all around the world. In our spare time whenever we need fun or relaxation, we can find what we have been looking for on television. It is really excellent time when the family sits together in front of the television after supper, sharing the happiness that the television brings to them. There are a variety of channels, providing programs that aim at different needs of audiences, such as music channel, sport channel, shopping channel, news channel and so on. As a result, the audiences will not feel lonely even they stay at home by themselves.
Generally speaking, I admit that may be television really brings us some trouble, but just remember that everything has two sides. We should not reject it blindly, especially when it bring us more benefit than damage. In a word I do not agree that television is the opium of the masses in modern society.

CNUK1139,4.0,2.5,,,,,Most university degrees are theoretical and do not prepare students for the real world. They are therefore of very little value,"
Since the national urgent calling for higher-educated workers brings on the policy that universities should take in more students, the number of the annual university graduates has been increased dramatically. The university degrees seem to have devalued overnight. Waves of controversies follow. Some remarks:"" Most university degrees are theoretical and do not prepare the students for the real world"", then they come up with the conclusion,"" Therefore they are of little value."" In my opinion, the view should be discussed from different aspects.
The value the degrees represent has dropped. In the changeable and highly developed world today, the speed of information renewal is faster than ever before. The knowledge the students study at universities often fall behind. A research, led by the Students Union last semester, has revealed that over 80% of the students in our college held the view that the courses they were taking were out of date, not related to the latest development in the economic trade. Besides, the degrees require a list of pretty good scores, yet, they always neglect the practical capability. Degree is just one representative of one's education level. It alone cannot do anything. In a recent research, it is found that among the 400,000 homeless people in Britain nearly 40,000 have university degrees. The organizer of the project points, out that the outcome warns the people of the fact that university degrees could not guarantee a blessed life because many other factors, for instance, family background, health conditions, have to be taken into consideration. In terms of these, university degrees are not of much value.
However, we could not ignore the important part the university degrees play in our lives.
First of all, the degree is proof of one's capacity. The study in university differs from the study process in elementary school or middle school. This study aims at the particular training of the students. The training is to guide them to become those who are able to ponder over various subjects and capable of self-studying. In most advertisements of job-hunting sections, degree is frequently referred to in the requirements for higher and more challenging positions. Bachelor degree has become ""tickets"" for job hunting, necessary but not essential. Secondly, degree remains a significant access to evaluating applicants and assessing employees nowadays. It happens that in a recent housing advertisement, the ownership of university degrees and certificates even benefits the customers. The higher the education level, the more the benefit. The saleswomen explain that the measure is to attract more qualified residents to move in and one customer comments that it would promote forming a better culture atmosphere in the district. The degrees seem to be of much importance, at least in this case. More and more, university degrees are likely to play the roles as tools in modem economic society.
It is apparent that the number of degree holders is increasing rapidly. Though the value of them declines on the surface, the value of university degrees does not mean only a piece of paper. The value is to be created by the university graduates, in other words, the degree holders.

Television plays a very important role in people's life. People can have a rest while watching television, and they can get much information from it. In a word, television brings a lot of happiness and convenience to people. But it also brings a number of problems. Many people spend too much time on television. Some of them even watch television day and night. Some people say that, television is the opium of the masses in modem society. I am quiet agree with this opinion.
As we know, any behave that leads to a pleasurable experience will be repeated, especially if that behavior requires little work. Psychologists call this pattern as reinforcement. That's what we mean by addiction. In this sense, television really fits into the category of an addictive agent.
Most of the time, people watching television for rest, while they watch the television, the whole body like the arthrosis, muscle and the nerve are in natural opiates, and during the process it need not cost much engineer, this make people feel very comfortable, and this action of release easy habit-forming. So there is little difference between the actions of an addictive agent. The more serious problem is that, though some people notice this kind of situation, and they stop watching TV for a prolonged period of time, but this period seems very difficult for them. scientist do two research, in one experiment they asked the people who have notice the problems bring by television to stop watching television for a month, during the time, most of them suffered from depression, saying they felt as though they had lost a very good friend. On the other experiment scientist agreed to kick their television viewing habit for a year, with the added bonus of payment. None could resist the urge longer than six months, and over time all of the participants showed the symptoms of opiate withdrawal: increased anxiety, frustration, and depression. The research shows that, the television works as opium, and we all feel its effects.
Another problem is that, the result of addiction to television was destructive. First, people watch television for a long time, they would react to television content as if it was real, and people's emotion also would undulate with the plot. It is bad for the healthy of people. Second, television can be harmful to your sense of self-worth, the comprehend of your environment, and your physical health. Recent research have show that more than 60% of American women think that compare with the actresses or models, they are overweight, and almost all of them hope they can as thin as the actresses and models who are always looked on television. Many movies and plays on television are full of violent plot; Studies have shown that people of all generations greatly overestimate the danger of violence in real life. This situation is also cause by the television, because their brains cannot discern reality from fiction while watching TV.
Television is bad for your body as well. Wallow in television, can cause the result of fatness, the lack of sleeping, and the radicalization from television and so on.
There are so many disadvantages about watching television. And many people around us still suffered the troubles which bring by addicting in television. It is quiet true that: television is the opium of the masses in modem society.

CNUK1142,3.5,3.5,,,,,Television is the opium of the masses in modern society. Discuss.,"
Television, a machine that we human beings use to amuse ourselves and acquaint ourselves with the world, can be seen everywhere in the modern society-home, in the office, in the hotel and so on. Television has become more and more indispensable in human beings life and we can hardly live without television.
Therefore, a viewpoint of television being the opium of the masses in modern society has come out. However, it is absolutely not exaggerating the truth just to scare people. Our love towards television and dependence on it resemble that on opium in the past.
First, television has the magic to make human beings irresistibly be fond of it exactly as opium did before. Humans were deeply attracted by the mysterious thing as soon as television was invented for it leads human to another world. From television, we enlarge our eyeshot and widen our knowledge. We always enjoy the happiness television brings to us and it gradually plays an essential role in our daily life. Once we get in touch with television, we will get used to it just as people did towards opium in the old days. Some of us, especially the children, are even crazy about it.
The second similarity between television and opium is no matter any of them that human beings get accustomed to, we can't get rid of it easily. Television is a principal medium for us to gain all kinds of information. Without television, we will lose a way to contact with the world. In addition to that, we get much pleasure while watching TV. For instance, when we are in a bad mood, we will feel better as long as we open the television and watch some interesting programs. To a certain extent, television has the ability to make us immerse in the happiness and forget the sadness temporarily. There will be less joy in the world if no television. We can hardly image a world that human live out of televisions. That must be the extraordinarily unbearable thing and more to those TV fans. And we will feel very uneasy then. Therefore, it is impossible to cut off the relationship between the human and the television.
However, the most serious thing we must pay more attention to is television will directly and indirectly do harm to our body health and even the mental health.
Some television fans, especially some children, will sit before the television all day and watch TV programs without a rest, which make our eyesight decline rapidly. Meanwhile, some of us will eat a lot of snacks unconsciously while watching TV and we may become fatter and fatter. Watching TV is a vital reason why more and more people are fat. Further more, the radiation of television is so intense that it may damage our bodies. From another point of view, many advertisements in television will mislead us to buy some product be harmful to our health or unfit for us. Thought television by no means do any injury to us on purpose, it actually harm us indirectly.
There are also some fans that are indulged in television. They drop up their work, their study and other important things they have to do. Take some students for example, who make up a large proportion of the TV fans, they are mentally taken up by televisions so as to cause their study into a poor condition. Worse still, some detrimental programs will induce students to commit crimes and endanger the safety of other people in the society.
The harmfulness of television is no less than that of opium. In a word, television to us is what opium to human beings. We must acknowledge the advantage and disadvantage of television and treat television properly.

Television has been regarded as the most popular tool of entertainment in the recent years. Accordingly, one family keeps one television, at least on average; some even two or three ones. Why? How can the television be so enchanting? Is it because television is the opium of the masses in the modem society? 
Absolutely, the answer is No. First of all, we must make it clear that what is Opium. By its native, the ready-made opium is a state of flour and used for smoking a pipe. (Here, the person taking opium is, so to speak, smoker.) Once the smoker begins to take opium, even a tiny amount of opium, he finds it is difficult to stop, for the opium indeed gives him high enjoyment. That is the glamour of opium. Furthermore, it does harm to any smoker, the physical health and metal health. The more smoker takes opium, the weaker his body and the more self-indulgent he is. This is the first point.
Then how does the television work? Judging from the television entertainer, they roughly fall into four groups: the working-class, students, retired people and idle people. Generally speaking, the working-class seldom turn on the TV until they come home from work; so those people are not likely to be addicted to watching TV. Instead, they probably watch TV for relaxation after a long hard work. While for pupils they mostly obey their parents order that they should finish their homework before turning on the TV; and for the grown-up students, watching TV is not only the means of relaxing themselves, but also the way to get different kinds of information, news, products introduction and other meaningful program. And obviously, television just adds more colorfulness into their dull lives after retirement. In these cases, television is no opium but sweet dew for them.
Are the idle people are, you may ask, likely to be addicted to watching TV? And is it probable for those students who do not intend to work hard at school and indulge themselves to watching TV? Of course yes is the answer. But as these questions show, these people are just senseless without any motivation. They watch TV just as smoker takes opium. Without any restraint, both actions are harmful. Fortunately, such who take the television like this merely take up a small portion.
And what is the most important is that the fact that those people are addicted to watching TV for ever is not true. An illustration may take this point clear. Joy, one of my sisters, used to be addicted to watching TV. Although she was scolded severely or advised deep-heartedly by her parents, she found it was very hard for her to tear herself from the TV when she was in junior school. But now, she changes a lot. All because she has been a senior student and her task is to study well preparing for entering a desirous college. So, only when one has his own aim does he tear himself from the ""opium"".
So, from all I have stated above, television is no the opium of the masses in the modem society. Though the TV, the masses can get various information which is helpful and useful. Even for the minority who are so addicted to television, which it is harmful for them, they will be able to tear themselves from it someday when they find their true ones.

CNUK1144,3.5,3.5,,,,,Most university degrees are theoretical and do not prepare students for the real world. They are therefore of very little value,"
Nowadays more and more university students can't find suitable jobs after their graduation, or at least most of them can't behave as good as people expected in the society. Then a saying gradually come to commonly accepted, that is, ""Most university degrees are theoretical and no not prepare students for the real world."" 
As a university student I think this saying is of little value. Firstly, university education not only means a study of knowledge but also a learning of ability. In general most of the knowledge except for the major course has been taught in the middle school. At this period, relearning is not simply a waste of time but a kind of reconsideration. The university students can think over the knowledge at their perspectives. More important is applying what they have learnt to practice. This is totally different from what they did in middle school times when the main purpose of education is to improve the text marks. Accordingly Most of the students are fighting for the college entrance examination regardless of the improvement of ability. By contrast the final aim of college education is to help the students to form their outlook. In other words, the universities teach the students how to be real men. This kind of cultivation is invisible but invaluable.
More importantly college education is a process of self-study. No teacher will come to supervise and urge the students to study. It is the students' responsibility to choose their lives. Therefore self-control plays a significant role in college life. In college students have much freedom and time to choose what they like to learn after school. They don't need to study under great pressure. In this process, if the students can not realize the real purpose of college education or they don't have a clear plan for their future they may go into a completely different direction when they encounter lure; when they can't bear the boring study.. This is why more and more social problems happened in colleges, such as playing computer games, being indulged into the internet, alcohol as well as cigarettes. Even suicide rate rapidly increases in college. How can students grown up from such kind of circumstance be useful in the society? We can't pin all the failures simply on the education system, after all the most important thing lies to the students themselves.
The last but not least, compared with those who had not received education from college, the university men have more advantages in the fierce competition. Their abilities are comprehensively higher all the way from concepts to action.
On the whole, university degree in every college is the same to every student but the interior content varies from one to another. University just provides every possible mean for every student, it's due to the students to choose their lives. Whether the students can transform the knowledge into their abilities or not is the key point. Of course it's better for the education system to be improved in order to help the students more efficiently and effectively.

Nowadays, television is becoming so common that it is almost an essential part of our life. If you ask a person this problem: what is a television and what can it bring about? I think the most general answer is that television can give me fun something like that. But I do not think television can really bring us pleasure. Conversely, it is the opium of the masses in modem society.
Television makes people get into the habit of seeing television. A lot of people turn on their television unconsciously when they go home. The coming result is that people will be addicted to the television. Whenever it is, they must keep their television on. This will waste a lot of invaluable time. People will be lazier. No one wants to do homework. Then, a family member asks this to do the homework and this asks the other to do the homework. The final scene is that a family quarrel breaks out just because of this trifle. A lot of divorce is result from these quarrels.
The worse is that a lot of parents do not care their children as they need to pay their energy on television program. Children need guides. If a child finds that no one care about himself, he will feel sad and behave abnormally. A lot of facts have told us this kind of children is more likely to be criminal. Also whole families sit together to watch TV program; it seems to be a warm thing. Actually, that is not. Human have spirit. They need communication. A good communication is a necessary part of a good family.
And most of that information which the television programs show us is not useful at all. A bored advertisement is broadcast again and again. Different meaningless entertainment films can be watched from morning to night. We can image that a person who is around these rubbish programs will get noting from it. Some TV series programs can mislay people. For example, those love series shown on TV is to perfect. Every guy is handsome and every girl is beauty, and they do not need care the money and some other very realistic things. They must get together as long as they really love each other. Some young imitate these. Some girls dream about this kind of love day and night.
""Unfortunately, most of them will find the reality is not so and they do not enjoy life. There are also some adult programs which are inappropriate to children. But there are no restrictions.
Besides, there is no doubt that some radiation sickness can be caused if human is exposed to the television for a long time. If we keep sitting before a television, our eyes can not get enough rest. It is very easy to be shortsighted. In addition, since our blood cannot move around our body smoothly, it is very bad for our health.
In a word, people should refrain from watching TV, unless people want an abnormal and unhealthy life.

CNUK1148,2.5,2.5,,,,,Television is the opium of the masses in modern society. Discuss.,"
No matter you have noticed it or not, television, as a means of mass communication, has really became part of our life. It plays an important role in spreading information and mass entertainment. Many people spend hours sitting before the television and enjoying their favorite soap opera or violent scenes. It is really a waste of time. However, how many people realize that to some extent it is television that gradually affects their normal life, work and even the whole society's development. Television is the opium of the masses in modem society.
In order to cater for the different audiences, TV programs are made in accordance with different social classes and different ages, such as the working class, the disabled, children, the aged, etc. Programs about sports, music and latest news are popular to most people arid in this part it really does good to them. Nevertheless, more and more violent scenes appear on TV now and it has a strong appeal to young and inexperienced children.
And then comes the trouble. A great many of children, without their parents' help, are too young to tell the good from the bad. They do not know which kind of program may benefit them while some program may destroy them and lead them to be bad. They enjoy violent scenes and whenever they turn on TV they will enjoy such programs. It seems that they have an ""aptitude"" for imitating those violent behaviors shown on TV and put them into practice in daily life. Based on many researchers many tragedies happened just because of the young children's imitation. Scientists state that children always see violent scenes are much more inclined to be violent and to commit a crime. It is worth thinking about such a problem.
To the working class, they are likely to have free time and have the right to watch TV whatever they like and whenever they want. As far as I am mentioned, it is not so. Once they stay up late at night waiting for their favorite programs, the consequences will be aroused. Out of staying up, they are lack of sleep and they may be late the next or at least feel tired and sleepy. The whole day they will feel like being sent to sleep, then how could they be absorbed in work? The worse is that, not having enough sleep can not be made up by sleeping longer the next time. Instead, it will make people in a state of being exhausted for several days, and seriously impacts people's rest and work.
Television not only affects people's life and work, but also holds up the whole society's harmony and development.
When there is no TV in life, information was transferred by mouth and by people's. communication. However, since the TV being one part of a family, there is much less mutual understanding. People no longer called on each other, for almost every family owns a TV set, which provides people with the most wonderful recreational activities and the latest news. They are not necessary to visit one another to look for fun or get information. And day-by-day, people become isolated from each other and that is one of the reasons that why many people today feel they are lonely.
Furthermore, because of television, films and programmes of entertainment, such as opera, modem drama are shown on TV and many people refuse to go to a cinema to watch film or go to a opera house to watch a on-the-spot demonstration. Many opera houses and troupes were closed because of this. It really holds up the spread of the culture.
In a word, television is harmful to the masses. It acts just the same as the opium. It seems interesting on the surface but actually it is harmful to people, only that the bad is potential and usually not obvious at the beginning. We should check at the outset, make the best use of it and minimize unfavourable ones.

As I am growing up year by year, I spend less and less time on TV. Because I am coming to consider that watching TV is a waste of time. Take myself for example, in long vocations, when I feel I have no mood to do anything that is meaningful such as reading books, or when nobody calls me out to do some shopping or have get-togethers. I'll s it in front of a TV set, and put some peanuts aside. I can consume all the day with watching or changing TV programs and eating something. Frankly speaking, I don't find any fun in it. And in this way, some problems catch me behind 
First of all, as indulging myself into the TV programs, no more time would beleft for study, and I become lazy in the holidays, never touch the test books I have brought ho me and even the poems borrowed from the school library.
Second, sitting and eating in front of the TV set without any exercise causes me put on weight, which is a great worrisome for me as we girls always want to keep fit.
Third, I find my vision is getting poor as a result of watching too much TV. Sometime s my eyes hurt for no reason and I cannot continue to use my eyes efficiently. Not until I use some eyes-drop will my eyes be well again.
At last, watching too much TV can also be a waste of money, my parents have to pay for the electrical bills and what I do have put a large amount to the bill.
These are the main bad effects on myself for watching TV. Maybe you will say we can also benefit from it, because there are some educational programs which can enlarge our knowledge and our outlook.
Though TV, we are able to know what's happening both home and abroad immediately, we can enjoy MTV music for relax, we can have sight-seeing of the outside world jus t sit at home, children may fond of cartoon program and the old may kill time by TV so as to decrease the feeling of lonely.
However, every coin has two sides, there is no doubt that things will be easier if we can always turn to the bright side. But the point is that, we could not.
We have to keep a good control over watching TV. The point is, how can w e make it? To myself, I am not interested in watching TV, when I watch it, it means I f eel boring and want to do nothing. In this case, I suggest myself to engage in some activites that I am interested in, such as going to my friends' home and have a chat with them, doing some cleaning for my room or learning to cook some special dishes, and so forth.
I really don't consider TV can bring us more good things than bad ones if we don't h aye a good selt-decipline. I know most people can not control themselves well, so I advise everyone to find something more important in your life such as your study, your job or your hobby, spend your time on it instead of sitting in front of a TV set.

Why do people invente TV set? Why? 
That is because TV set plays an important part in people's life and give us a lot. In the old days, there is no TV sets. And people's life is very watery. They don' t know what happened outside, and the society developed very slowly.
But when the TV set was invented, the whole world was changed. People can know what happens outside and get information from all over the world through TV set, without going out. Because of this, people can reflect to the information and take measures, for example, people often watch TV set to get shopping information, job information, health information, sports information, commercial information, and so on. And the government also keeps track of information of the country through TV set. TV set is not only the way of getting information, but also a way of entertainment. People often watch plays, listen to musics, and see films to amuse themselves. And this satisfies people greatly and improves their life's lever.
Besides, because of TV set, the society is developing quickly. The facts has proved But some people says television is the opium of the masses in the modern society. I know why they have this opinion. Some regard that their children's grade derease just because of watching TV; some says watching TV take up most of their time, and they can't do the other things; some says watching TV makes their health worse and worse, and so on. But in my opinion, the children's grade dereasing is not only TV's fault. There are reasons resulting in the problem, such as the bad behaviors in the society, the curiosity of children and the lack of education from parents. TV is no faults. The key is that how people use TV. People should scrutinize the way of watching TV, right or wrong? We can't deny the adventiages of TV just because of that.
Assume that if there is no TV set in the world, what the results can you imange? I think the result is the same as there is no light in our life. People's life will become more watery, the quality of life will be derease, the development speed of society will be dereased.
I think the people who regard TV as the opium in the modern society is in minority, most people still accept the TV. Why? because they know the bad and the good of TV, they know the benefits of TV is larger than the harmnes of TV, and they know how to overcome the disadvantages and make use of the adventages of TV. TV makes their life better and better.
As we know, some countries in China are very poor, people there hasn't own their TV sets so far. They can't know about the outside world but they are eager to. with the economic and the industry of TV, the government helps people to install TV sets. So people there are very happy, because owning their TV sets, they can get rid of poverty more quickly. So they express their great appreciation to the government.
I think the people who regard TV as opium will not forget the happy time TV brought to them. Remember, TV is act the ill1portant role in our life. So I don't think television is the opium of the masses in modern society.

When the first TV was invented, a new period comes. Newspaper wasn't the only carrier that people get information from any more. Catching news is not only with novice but also with spot picture. Such new way's new is more attractive. Whatmore, newspaper needs time to print, but through the electric circuit, information can arrive at once. As a result, people like TV and become interesting in it.
With the rapid development of technology, black and white TV changed into collor TV which lively than it before. And TV become a necessary home aplliance. A house at least has a set. Indeedly, TV brings many interesting things to us, and amuzes us. But just as a corn has two sides, TV has its disadvantages.
A surveying turns out that the time people spent on TV is increasing every year. Take 2002 & 2003 for example, in 2002 people in the world spent 5.3 hours a day on TV in average, while in 2003 it raised to 6.1 hours a day. It said Japanese is on the above, it's 7.8 hours a day, follows American, Chinese and Italy. Which point does TV attract people contribution? I think the collorful advertisements and complicated teleplays do it. If someone is addicted to whichever teleplays, he or she will lose interest in other things and drop himself (herself) in it.
I had such a experience. When I wan in Junior school at grade two, a teleplay called Falling Star Garden which include 34 parts made me unreasonable. That time my mind was full of that wonderful love story. I even stayed up to watch it just to get the story's end. I can't imagine why I could do such behavior. Of course, the next day, I fell asleep in the class. That period I was lazy enough and had to review the textbook myself to catch up with other classmates. I think people should control themselves. So, although the teleplay moves me much, I persuade myself to control myself.
But as we know, watching TV is a good way to kill time. Even no teleplays, ads or proforms interest people, some person still prefer staying in front of TV instead of going out.
Nowdays, more and more people catch disease such as high blood preassure. Why? I think the main root come from people's fat body. And a great part of the cause of fat disease is people like to eat high calorie snack: fries, chocolate etc when watching TV. They contribute themselves on eating and watching, moved nowhere. In another word, people spend time on TV instead of exercise. Sometimes, I think, would TV can addicte people like Nicotine? Is watching TV waste of time?

Since its appearance in the 19th century, television has become an important part of our daily life. As a member of the media, it has many advantages such as visible, convenient, etc., but I think it's even more disadvantages. Television is the opium of the masses for the following reasons:
First of all, it is bad to our health. The screen of television set produces a kind of radioactive material, which does harm to our eyes if we watch TV for a long time and at a short distance from the screen. That is why we feel our eyes are tired and dried after watch TV program for some time.
Now that television can be harmful to us human being if we stay close in front of it for long period of time, some may say it is free from harm if we just treat it as a means of leisure. But the fact is most of us are addicted to TV once we show interest in the program. For instance, some of my roommates are crazy of a TV series named ""Chong Xiang Yun Xiao"", and they go to the resting room to catch this program every night on time, showing utmost enthusiasm and interest in it. If it is not on show due to some mechanical reason like electrisity failure, they would feel quite depressed that night. So it seems hard to control the time and distance once we are indulged in one program. TV-lovers are keen to TV as the addicts to opium.
Secondly, some television programs are mentally harmful. In order to make profit and attract more audience, some program involving violence, pornography, etc., are put on, which are doing no good for some audience, especially the youth.
Children is not so mature to distinguish unhealthy program to healthy ones. They even always imitate to act as the actors in a program do. When I was in my childhood, there were so many TV programs talking about the story of Leifeng, the idol for us to be ready to help others. Then I still keep this in mind. On contrast, a violent sight in the program can also influence us a lot and make me feel upset and horrible years later. Therefore, inferior quality television does no good to people's mentally health.
Last but not the least, advertisements in television are not, at least not all, based on fact, which misleads us. TV brocasting company is somewhat profit-oriented, and they do not mind if the advertisement is true or not, if it can obtain a great number of money from the business. Consumers are always exposed to this risk to find what they buy is not exactly what they expect, from a TV advertisement.
Based on the discussion above, we can draw a conclusion that despite some advantages, television has many bad effects on our life. Television, I think, is the opium of the masses.

Nowadays, there're more and more students do further study in universities. Of course, it will learn more to do that. But most of their going there is just for the degree. Because most of jobs demand degrees, although the companies always say that what they want is a really talented man. So you must have a good degree if you want to find a good job. However, most university degrees are theoretical. That's to say, not all the people with good degrees really have good skills. The majority of university degrees don't prepare students for the world.
The lessons students take for the degress are most theoretical. Many a university doesn't open practical lessons accounding to the theoretical lessons. As a result, the students are low in practical skills. Take Management for example. It's a good course. But students just learn the theory without practice. After their graduation, most of them can't make good use of the theory in their work. Some of them even will have forget all the theory they have learnt. How can such a person get a good job? I guess they'll lose their job even if they have got it by their good degrees, unless they try their best to improve their practical skills in time. In fact, theoretical things aren't without a single merit. Students can benefit from the theoretical lessons. Nevertheless, what most of jobs demand is not theory, but skills. It's helpless for their future job. So such theoretical lessons must to on with practical lessons. Only in this way, students can learn that can really help them in the future.
On the other hand, the university degrees don't prepare the students for neither their future job not the real society. The real society is complex and much more different from our universities. That we learn to get the university degrees are far away from the society demands. When we place ourselves in the real society, we should know how to deal with the relationship between various of people and ourselves, how to solve all kinds of problems during our work and life, how to confront blame from others... most of these we can't meet in our university life and can't learn from the theoretical lessons. But the university degrees cant offer us such kind of things. Students always don't know what should do and what should not do when they join the society. Therefore, university students can't know the society well just by the university degrees, no metion to play an important rule in it.
In short, most university degrees nowadays are of little value. They can't provide students with the very things that are good for their society bilities and understanding of the real world, just only theoretical lessons. That's not enough. During the university life, students must promote themselves, not only in theory, but also in skills and understanding of the real world. In other words, students should not just pay attention on the lessons related to the degrees. They'd better spend more time on improving their skills and preparing themselves for the real world not too dependente on the degrees. They can't used as rice.

In the university of China, students can granted only when he have got the enough points, and also he can get the degree in this way, otherwise, he won't get it forever they are told at the very beginning of the university how many points they should win in the coming years, but I have a questions: are the degrees the most important things?
Once at a time in China, the society judge people by the degrees. During the very time, people go to find jobs with the degrees they have. That is you can find a good job easily only if you are gradated from a famous university the road to be employed is wide for the famous university students.
First, let's have a look at the ways students to get the degrees. In fact, it's easily to pass the exams, I can say that it's too easy for the students to do so. But all the things are related with the exams, that is, you get the points if you have passed the exam. During the term, students don't need to study hard at all, because they know the teachers will give them some information before the exam and also the questions are easy to answer, and it's said that the tethers are kind enough to let them pass. What they should do is to remember what the teacher said in class, to do this they have to make notes in class but listen to the teacher. As a result, the students don't pay much attention at the studies, they do other things instead, such as find part-time jobs, join in many activities, play, act they don't consider much about the future short-lighted, maybe they are to find learn little things in the whole university lives.
Second, there are too much theoretical things, having little connection with the society. Too much is bad, and piratical things is necessary. At the first, you have to learn theory with the help of teacher, using the library, the internet. Students are busy at recording the notes in class, they don't have enough time to think, to ask questions, maybe they aren't listen to the teacher, either. That is not the student's fault, just because the society, which is not only in China, but in other parts of the world. Give the students a space to practice, to improve themselves is necessary to change it, please pay more attention to the abilities, don't just force the poor students to learn in a certain way. I know that most students have formed a bad habit to lead on the teachers. They say: the teachers are right forever, listening to teachers is a good idea all the time.
In other side, education has its good side, and we also can see the system is changing. Yes, that is it, things are developing. If we make effects to improve them, and there will be a good day tomorrow, aren't they? You know it will be a long way to go, so give a hand to it, you can find wonder will happen!

TV is not that bad. I really appreciate TV. Without it, I wouldn't know what my favourite football star look like or how well he play football; or wouldn't know what happened to the people at the other end of the ocean.
When I was young, TV played an important part in my life. Especially the cartoon. It colored my childhood. It brought joy to me and also taught me how to be a good girl by its own way. My favourite cartoon is ""dragon ball"". When I grew up, the hero and his friends grew up, too. I learned a lot from him and really attracted by his innocentce, braveness and faith. He is still in my mind now.
And nowdays, TV prevent me from falling behind the world. By watching TV, I learn what is in fashion and what is out of date.
For the people in the countries or poor areas, TV is the only window that they can look out and know what happened to the world outside. Because they seldom go out or travel to a far away place, it's just unnessesally for them to do so. In such places, most of them are farmers. They are back home from the field at dusk and then have supper with their families. But, what will they do after supper? The outside is dark, and there are no entertaments or parties, unlike some foreign countries. So, the only thing for them to do is to sit down relaxly with their families chatting while watching TV. They can learn some news from home and abroad, and watch some films or some TV play series. Those maybe make them happy, maybe make them upset. But anyway, they really need it. It is the only way they keep in touch with the changble world.
What about the people in the cities? There are a lot of entertaments in the street, such as night clubs, cinemas, theatres and parties. And they also can go shopping. Even at night, some cities are as bright as daytime, for there are lights everywhere. But, as it getting more and more dangerous to be outside at night, people would rather stay at home. By the way, quite a lot of the people living in the cities like to know the things happened around, and sometimes they can't save time for reading newspaper. So, they turn on TV and do anything they like when listen, not just sitting there. For some housewives, who's husbands go out for work and children are at school. TV must have been part of their lives. You know, they love TV play series so. It's the best for them to kill time.
I don't care a thing that others think of TV, because everything has two sides. Even Chairman Mao did something wrong. But please compair the good ones with the bad ones it occur to people. And you will find, if we say no to TV, we should also stopping cars from running becaus of traffic accidents.

In the old days, TV was a kind of luxury, not each family could afford the cost of buying a television machine. As the science and technology developed. Television are no longer expensive now. It become a very simple electrical appliance. Almost each family has a television now, no matter the rich ones or the poor ones. Not only the young but also the old like watching television. Since the television is so widely spread, it bring us a lot, advantages, and disadvantages.
Now, let me talk something about the advantages first. In my opinion, the most important advantages is that television can disseminate information very quickly and widely. People like to watch News, because from the News we can know what had happened just now and what is happening in the world immediately, without going anywhere. After one day's work, some people like to watch some entertainment program which make them feel relax and happy. There are some programmes that are about knowledges on popularisation of science. From these kinks of programme we can learn much things about the nature. After watching that people will realize how beautiful the nature is and the necessary of protecting the nature.
Because of the widely spread of television. Television can influence people from all over the world. So, in modern society, some people regard television as an industry. Many companies advertise on television in order to increase the sale volume. Because there are many kinds of television programme which need many people to make. So it can offer many positions, such as actor, film maker and director.
Many people prefer television to newspaper or radio. Why? That's because by watching television we can not only hear something, but also watch something. That can make it more easily to understand are more interesting. When you want to read newspaper, you have to stop your work, but when you are watching TV, you don't have to.
As a coin has two sides. We benefit a lot from television, but it also had some bad influence to us. For example, if someone watch television too much, his or her communication ability will be not so good as other's. it means that sometimes they don't know how to organize their languages or their words are not so logical as other people's.
Although the children can get lots of knowledge by watching television, it's not good for them to watch too much television. Because it's harmful to their eyes. Sometimes, many violent or sexy scenes are shown on television. It is had for children because they are too small to differentiate. Some criminals are influence by watching television. Some culprits kill somebody like the plays.
Although television has its has its bad influences, it's still a very useful tool in modern society. So we should use it in good ways, but not regard it as the opium of the masses.

Television is the opium of the masses in modern society. It that ture?
Franktly speaking, I don't know. For most parents, especially whose children are at the age of 7-15, their answers maybe ""Yes"". As we know, children at that age are almost interested in TV programmes such as cartoons, films and so on. Every day when they come back home form school, the frist think they do may be turn on the Television. They are thinking at it every so often maybe even when they're having classes!
Secondly, the ones who have nothing to do, I mean if people don't have jobs or affires to deal with, they are free day and night, then, Television become their best friend! They have fun in television programmes and kill the time depending on watching TV.
Another situation, if someone is attracted by what programmes which are his favoriate, the point of "" Television is the opium"" may be supported.
In fact, what is ""opium"" on earth? Do you know? I don't know in fact, or , I can't explain it clearly anyhow.
The society is changing day and night, also the science is developing every minute, ways of living of human being are changed because of these. The earth becomes smaller and smaller, people get in touch with each other more and more convirenit. The quality of life is improved, but also brings some bad effects at the same time, because of so much comfortable lazy comes out disgeneration comes out and so on. It refracts in many kinds of filed.
Does that mean ""opium""?
If so, Internet maybe another opium of the masses in modern society!
In my opinion, Internet is more interesting than Television. First of all, you can watch TV programmes whatever you like on line. What's more, there are still so many things you can do through the internet! For example, you can search what you want or what you are interested in and downland it; you can chat with you friends nomatter where they are and which country they come from; you can get news and information at the frist minute......
But every coin has two sides. To those who cannot controul themselves well, what internet brings to them is harmful more than helpful I think. Internet can attract every kind of people, nomatter how old are they or what jobs they do and so on. So if it can be called opium, it can be the biggest opium in modern society! 
So, what should I say next? I think, wether a thing is a opium or not depends on how it is used and the attuide of people to it. That is to say, take Television for example, it can be a good teacher and friend to human beings, it also can be a terrible tiger to us. So I think it depend on people's attuide to these modern machines.

Degree plays an important role in our life no matter which ranks. For the high-ranking people, they consider degree is a symbol of status in despite of getting a good job without any degrees. For the low-ranking people, they consider degree can help them get a good job in order to get rid of poverty of course, learning more knowledge is the basically study aim.
To our surprise, there is a big difference between the students in school and in real word. Taking high score is the must important of all for a student in China because this is the warranty that others judge whether you are good or not. Therefore, study and study is put down as all-important thing by mass of students. However, the conclusion is studier does well in school but week in society. They have less experiment in practicing. There is little doubt at a loss when they join in the company first. For example, one of my sister's classmates, she was regarded as the best student in the university for her high score all the time. To our surprise, she can't do well in working the same as her studies. As she said, she didn't even know how to use the printer when she was asked to do on during on the first day. So it is humiliating for her to give others a bad impression. Such examples happened everywhere. It can be argued, of course, that there should be some students who are both good at studying and practicing. It is not always the case. In a word, degree doesn't equal to ability.
In the ground scheme of society, degree is the first key to look for a job. How to choose ability students for a company? At present, most of the corporations emphasize two procedures that degree and interview overall. Sometimes you have to get a high degree so that you may attend the interview. So everybody understands fundamentally of the degree. In other words, circumstance force us studying hard so as to ignore other things. On the other hand, the company doesn't know about students' cires of study and ability. Maybe the reason owes to the education system in China. Attaching important to high score is the centre of education all the time. That leads to lower university students' integrated diathesis.
Nowadays, coming into being a mainstream that not only knowledge but also ability is important gradually that is to say, a majority of students need ecumenic grade but better practice ability. They attend lots of activities enthusiastically such as student union, assn. part-time job and so on. In contrast they are more week in studying than other classmates. On the contrary, their ability is stronger than others.
In conclusion, degree plays an important but no useful role in the real word. It only helps you looking for a job. The following things depend on yourself. So we could see the important factor is ability instend of degree in the word. This is the requiring of age today.

How much does television mean to you? 
Would you sacrifice your mind, your health, and your well-being just to keep a hold of it? Most people would. They are unaware of the severe effects that TV has on our lives and on our future. I think that television having become the opium of the masses in modem society should be banned from all human households because of the negative ideas it exploits, the creative minds it destroys, and the growing amount of kids and adults. Television has become the opium of the masses in modem society.
In the last decade, the amount of vioilence on television has greatly increased and so has the number of senseless homicides and suicides in our country, especially in the western country. Television's influence has been extremely harmly to the young. Children do not have enough experience to realize that TV shows persent an unreal world. They want to imiate what they see. By the time they are out of high school, most young people have watched about 15,000 hours of television, and have seen about 18,000 killings or other acts of violence .AII educators and psychologists agree that the "" television generations"" are more violent than their parents and grandparents.
Meanwhile, the promiscuity showed regularly on household televisions has intrigues us and numbed our sense of what's right and what's wrong in society, so television is just like the opium! 
With the increase in the number of television sets in modem society, more and more young people have been robbed of their creativity. With TV, hardly anything is left to the imagination. Before the existence of television, all people were forced to create their own opinions and images of things in their own minds. But with TV, all the images are created for you and almost all the arguments are one-sided. With TV, you no longer create your own ideas; you are told them.
""I have been deeply short sight, since I addict to TV! And I really hate it , but I still can't extricate oneself"" Television has a great impact on the health of people. The seductive TV programmes as the opium waste most of our time. Inactivity and overeating of adults and kids alike are a common result of excessive TV watching. According to the same experts, the young are also less patient. Used to TV shows, where everything is quick and entertaining, they do not have patience to read an article without pictures, to listen to a teacher who doesn't do funny things like people on children's programs.
Television is slowly and potentially taking its toll from us modem people. It is stealing all of the things that are most precious to us--our mind, body, and soul, just like opium. If you rely on television for all your entertainment, I think that you would be way better off looking for it within yourself and the people around you.
In conclusion, television means the opium of the masses in modern society.

In our present society as a developing country, owing to the rapid economic development, the gap between the poor and the rich is growing. Therefore, with the modernity - snobbery, people's minds or ideas changed into the unbalanced tendency. Many people daily and nightly dreamed of being rich-men themselves. As a result, they try their best to do what they want just in order to achieve the only goal. Finally, they set a trap for themselves into the terrible jail.
Usually, there are four main conditions to result in crimes. However, in the end, they can get the same fruit that they are sent to the dead jail, due to their own different reasons. Here are the four conditions as follows:
First of all, due to poor family. In some families, for example, the children have no good and warm environment to be brought up, or the parents divorce, etc. The children who raised like those kinds of the families are easier to commit crime than the other ones. They are likely to be thief, robber, drug-addict, prostitute and so on.
Besides poor family, then due to poor education. According to the report, there are 80% crimes who are not accepted well-education. Since they are ignorance and don't' have good knowledge of law or even they don't know at all what the law means. So they commit crimes under their unconsciousness.
In addition, due to poor income, these crimes are usually economic criminals. Perhaps they have a good and warm family, and have well-education, but they are not satisfied with their basic salary like some governmental clerks. When they are put on a pair of handcuffs, they began to wake up and know what they have done. But everything is too late.
Finally, that is due to poor management. In China, especially, some corrupt region, the policemen's quality is very urgent to be rectified. Because in the common phenomena, as long as the criminals give some money or others to the policemen, they will be released without any dangerous. As the matter stands, the policemen encourage the criminals to go on committing crimes.
Above all, the concerned authority should take some active actions to improve the stricter problems. They should do their bit to reduce crimes and prevent ones to further worsen. As long as the concerned authority pay more attention to their people, it is believed that the whole society is hopefully better for the tomorrow.

Does the university degrees become worthless? Nowadays more and more students can go to university to receive higher education, so do the adults who have worked for years. It made some people worried about that the university degrees are not as valuable as before. They said that the universities had become the assemble lines, and produced the products -undergraduates with university degrees, non-stop. The quality of the undergraduates were much worse than before. As far as I was concerned, I do not agree with them.
There is no doubt that it is no difficulty for students and adults to enter the university, but it is not equals for the low quality of the undergraduates. Instead, education standards are higher than in the past. Most of the students who study in university know so much about the foreign culture and history. They really want to go outside to see the world, and know at lease two languages, some of them even know four ones.
They study very hard, but they do not confine themselves to classroom reading only. They are eager to put the theories, which they have learned from books, into practice; and some of them find the part-time jobs in spare time. When they are asked why they want to find the jobs they will say that they just do not want to depend on their parents any more, and it is time for them to train the ability of independ finance, also it is abest way to experience the real life.
It is not surprised that, young as they are, they have plan their life all by themselves, they have set their targets. During doing this, they do not just listen to their parents advices, they also consider about their own advantages and disadvantages. They do not take things for granted, what they believe is "" No pains, no gains"".
They do not just admire other people's opportunities and living standard. They have their own life style, also they have the spirit of self- reliance as well as a sense of responsibility for the society they live in. they pay much attention to the social prombles around them, and try their best to find out why they happen and how to solve it. In other words, they are no longer the innocence of the ivory tower.
I have confidence that if those people, who have said it was no longer profitable for students to have the university degrees, know the things above, they may realize that they are just overanxious. The undergraduates are not the low quality products, but the future of the society.

CNUK2011,3.0,4.0,,,,,Television is the opium of the masses in modern society. Discuss.,"
Everything in the world has its own two sides. Without exception, there are both advantages and disadvantages brought about by television. In my opinion, everyone should admit that its advantages outweigh its disadvantages.
The main reason that can be seen by everyone is that television presents a vivid world in front of us. It tells us what is happening right now in the world. Television not only gives us the news in which we are interested but also shows it in pictures more powerful than words. In particular, important events are often broadcast live so that the audiences feel as if they were participating.
Another factors we must consider is that television also plays an educational role in our daily life. We are often attracted by the programs about life in foreign countries which we want to know about. We can also learn about history by watching related programs. English programs are popular among the people who are studying this language. What is more, university TV has been recognized as the most effective method of part-time education.
In addition, we can get much information about the merchandises that we want to buy from the TV advertisements which lead us a convenient life. We are able to get all sorts of the first-hand news all over the world through TV, and many of us satisfied the life style with television. As the matter of fact, I believe that we are already consider the TV as a part of our life.
On the other hand, there are some complaints about the television. For example, some children spend hours before the little screen, ignoring their study, outdoor activities and even their family. Parents say that these kids are indifferent to nearly everything and premature somehow.
And the existence of TV has brought about alienation among friends and family members. TV provides a ready means of relaxation for people who spend their days doing routine and busy jobs. Therefore, they communicate less with their family members. Moreover, this leads to fewer joint activities between relatives.
Furthermore, poor-quality TV programs can have severe effected on people's mood and behavior. For instance, a person who watched too many crime programs may become too fearful and cautious. In addition, unhealthy programs can stir a disgusting curiosity.
Nevertheless, it is not the television's fault. We should tell our children how to handle these problems properly.
In short, given the factors I have just outlined, it is safely to draw the conclusion that television is more advantageous.

As the societies economic development, more and more people studying in university and get university degrees. However, there is a different opinion that university degrees are only theoretical and people do not get the knowledge existing in the real world, and it is a little value.
Through its philosophy of ""quality with equality"", the university degrees are endeavors to promote equality not only with its own programmes, but also through its service to the broader community. In general, there are some advantages of universities degrees could be divided.
Firstly, the general level of education is almost certainly an appropriate top priority for a country aiming to raise its standard of living. But other factors matter for output per worker. One is the amount of plant and equipment available to combine with workers' efforts to produce goods and services. The university degrees are exists primarily to teach and do research. And the public accountability are requires simple, easy-to-understand measures. Performance-based budgets require annual measures of performance. But it is not an easy job for people to pass their course and get the university degrees at last. From their study, they can learn some basic knowledge for their fields. At that time, people also get practical experience excavating and surveying. Start volunteering on archaeological field projects for the experience during college, and continue to do field work at every opportunity. Also, while in college try to do an internship with a local cultural resource management firm conducting salvage archaeology or a museum. Every bit of experience and relevant work leads to recommendations, this all adds up to a better chance at finding future work. This is why people want to finish their course excellently; they can find a good job.
Secondly, university degrees not only bring people some important knowledge, but also can affect people's future. As we know, if people get university degree that affect people find a good job. On the other hand, people also can get some skills using in their real world.
But the university degrees also have some disadvantages, such as people may not have a chance to get a lot of experience for their fields. People do not get enough from their further.
According to the discussion as above, the value of university degrees in the real world have both advantages and disadvantages. But the disadvantages are less than advantages. To sum up, university degrees will still be very value for people in the real world.

On the one hand, it is a nice thing to study in the university as a student; it can push you to carry on to learn different courses, and all kinds of other widely subject, good for you to look at the world. So that, people can get the knowledge from the study case, and the lecture from the tutor who has the senior education. However, learning things is helpful for you to try to find a good job in the future.

Secondly, knowledge is your wealth, because you can use the knowledge to earn money, the value of that is you cannot leave this for other people, it belongs to you. Money is fixed wealth, but the knowledge is wider than that. Different people choose different ways to choose their ways in future. As the result of they choose if they studied or not.
On the other hand, people can use the degree do some crime, they can make a copy of the university degree, due to do another one which is not exist, and sell them to the socialise, tell lie to the boss of the company, let the company lose much benefit, otherwise, the company does not rely on the university degree, make difficult with the university student. In addition to expand our knowledge, like getting the Master degree or MBA degree.
To conclude, the university degree is very useful to all of the people, and it is the real value of yours. Anyone cannot move from you or stolen form you. If you have the degree you have a guarantee of your future. So that, you are a winner of getting knowledge.

CNUK3066,3.0,4.0,,,,,Television is the opium of the masses in modern society. Discuss.,"
Nowadays, I think most of the families have at least a television. It looks as if television is one part of people's lives. However, some people think that television is the opium of the masses in modern society. In my opinion, on one hand, I agree with this idea. On the other hand, I disagree with it. After all, every coin has two sides.
As everyone know, as long as you eat opium once, it will be difficult for you to give up eating it. The same as opium, some TV programs made it difficult for people to give up watching. For example, more and more children like watching cartoon programs. They like the figures and their image in the programs. So they are eager to learn from them. They will buy the toys which appear in the programs out of control. They won't do anything if they are watching TV. Because of wasting a lot of time, it must do harm to their study. How about adults? If the program attracts them, they will watch it no matter what time it begins. They must sit in front of the TV in time as if watching TV is one of their job. What's worse, they won't go to work because of a football match or so on. They may feel unhappy if they can't watch the program they like. Just as someone will feel hurt if they don't have opium to eat.
However, on the other hand, watching TV do a lot of good to human-beings. Firstly, people can know the world quickly and clearly without going to every place. Because the programs on TV are more lovely than those words in books, people may want to learn knowledge more than from books. Secondly there are many different programs, people can choose the program according to their interest. TV can give them help when they are in a bad mood or having nothing to do. They can find happiness from TV. Thirdly, people can buy things with the help of TV. It's very convenient, people are willing to buy more things which can increase the encomy's development. At last but not at least, will you feel warm if all members of your family watch TV together. I think watching TV is a way to improve relationship between family members.
To sum up, wether television is opium or not depends on the person who watch TV. As long as the person can control themselves, they can learn a lot of things from television.

CNUK4007,3.0,4.0,,,,,Television is the opium of the masses in modern society. Discuss.,"
I generally agree that television is the opium of the masses in modern society. Watching television can become an addiction and has many disadvantages. However, I do not very much agree that TV is mainly as harmful as opium but it also brings considerable benefits to us.
In the contemporary city, almost every family is in procession of at least one television set. In Hong Kong, according to the Hong Kong Government, the average person has 0.5 TV set. That is to say, each family has two. TV becomes a necessity of life. Some people even cannot survive without it. Turning on television sets become the first things many people will do after switching on the lights when they come home, despite the fact that they may be even not watching them. Television becomes a habit.
TV drama series is a typical example that makes us become TV addicts. After watching the first few episodes, you cannot stop watching till endings. You have to take this drug regularly. Therefore, it may be the reason that there are continuous series of 'Friends', 'ER, '24', etc. People will rush home just for sitting in front of the television before series begin. They will record them when they cannot arrive at home on time or choose the restaurants which are equipped with TV. One of my friends buys a TV magazine every week simply for reading the story of the drama in advance.
Recently, there was a popular drama programme broadcasting in Hong Kong. When the last episodes screened last Saturday, it was reported that a lot of restaurants were only half-full, bearing in mind that people there cannot have a seat before waiting for at least one hour in weekend. TV is really a powerful drug.
A few people are highly addicted to TV. They will spend hours and hours in front of television everyday regardless of types of programme. They are more likely to be overweight and more likely to crave the high-fat snack food and may also lose their ability to imagine.
As it is commonly known that TV has many bad impacts. A lot of parents nowadays restrict their children to watch more that a few hours' TV a week hoping that they can spend more time on school and reading. However, a few parents in Hong Kong encourage children to watch more English-language channels which should not only educational but also entertaining. It is proved that their English level especially colloquial English is greatly improved.
Nevertheless, opium can kill people but can also treat illness when being used properly. TV is just the same and it also provides huge advantages when we moderate the time spending on TV. Television does not only offer the relaxing pastime but also valuable, useful and worth knowing information. We watch TV news to know about what happens in our country as well as around the world. We watch documentary programmes to obtain up-to-date information and learn new knowledge. Television can even make our world smaller.
TV is an addiction or work wonder? It also depends on our choices.

CNUK4009,3.5,3.0,,,,,Most university degrees are theoretical and do not prepare students for the real world. They are therefore of very little value,"
It is common for people to take further education in the university as students believe that they could have a better job opportunity after graduation. However some students may think that most degrees are lack of practical experience when apply to the real world. Does it mean studying in the university is a waste of time? If that is the case, there would not be so many people apply for degree courses and it is not necessary for universities to introduce new courses for students. There must be something we can learn through the university.
Although there are few 4-year-courses giving students an opportunity to gain experience in companies, most university degrees are 3-year- course basis. Students receive information from lecturers, handouts and textbooks but it does not mean they will succeed at once after graduation. Moreover, not all theories are applicable to every job title. It seems that doing a degree course is nothing beneficial to future careers. Sometimes knowledge learnt from university may not applicable to the occupation, however having those knowledge can be an advantage when applying for jobs. It is because theories are something experienced by experts, they explain how system works in a specific field and giving examples in text, graphs or pictures. For example, a student who studies computing needs to write a homepage. If he does not know the special codes of HTML or other computer languages, he could not just make it up because everything has its own rules and procedures, which textbooks or theories are the materials people can follow. As the real world is unknown to students who do not have work experience, those information are very helpful for them to understand the basic structure of the areas where they are interested in.
People may argue 'theories are opinions by experienced people but they may not 100 percent right, why they cannot teach something more useful and practical?' It is true that theories may not up-to-date and sometimes not all accurate. Nevertheless, students can learn from previous experience and think of a better way to improve after knowing the theories. Therefore theories are the fundamentals of practice. Besides, working is not all about experience. It is about people, communication and teamwork. In universities students need to do courseworks, group works, presentations as well as exams in order to understand the subject. They allow students to learn how to communicate and work with others, discuss and allocate work loads, also learn to produce good pieces of work. They will become more responsible and well organised through group works. Furthermore, they will be more confident talking in front of people through presentations. There are practical exercises involved actually.
Above all, degree course has its own value. It is a stage for students to start from the basics, help them to build up concepts of the real world, and gradually prepare for their future. Some people may spend time doing part-time course in university even they have a job. It proves that experience is not enough. In addition, qualifications are essential when applying for jobs, study at the univesity would be an important way to prepare for the real world!

CNUK4011,3.5,3.5,,,,,Feminists have done more harm to the cause of women than good,"
Feminists, belonging to the most arguable issues in nowadays, play a core
role of job- dividing and social status' forming. Those who support the
equality of male and female believe that feminists are good for women,
while others insist that what feminists have done to women is definitely
more harmful. The argument has been continued for several decades. Along
with the researches of the scientists, new evidences are revealed to give
the latter one stronger proves. Following are the details of this issue.
To begin with, feminists do have given female more chances to prove their
capabilities and creativities. In many working circumstances, women are
playing more important roles than men, or at least equal to men. However,
scientists claimed that there have been too much more working stresses
put on women resulting in the unharmonious between family members and
home violence. According to Jerry Z Muller (2003), nearly 30 percent
women are facing home violence or quarrels with family members result 
from too strong working pressure, which all come from the ideas of
feminists. Dr. Muller said that women are the most significant elements
of a specify family, whose hormone are secreted to keep everything they
may concern into a certain balance, to reduce potential quarrels. The
more attentions women pay to their job, the less they spend to their
family members. What the feminists done is already harmful to women in the
passed decades.
More over, another important difference between men and women is the
strength differences. Womens abilities of heavy work are less than
men's. This phenomenon results from the different amount of water
contained in blood of men and women, the latter contains more than about
15 percent as well as that of men, reducing the oxygen delivering
capability of female. So, it is not strange that men are more suitable to
carry heavy things. Hence, it is too arbitrary to carry out feminists
without concerning the differences between male and female, even though
men and women belong to the same species.
In addition, it is obviously that women are easier to feel tied than men.
It is proved by Mr. Muller that there are more red cells in men's blood
(about 20 percent higher) than that of women's. Since red cells' duty is
to supply the oxygen to the body cells, less red cell inducing women are
easy to get tire in general times. Appropriate concerns about the
different situations between men and women are good to improve the
efficiency of the latter's.
To sum up, though men and women are both human being, they are still quite
different from each other, not only as individuals, but also as two
different genders, which lead to the unlikely job adaptations and family
maintenances. What feminists did in the passed several decades is
definitely too arbitrary to reduce the inappropriate situations that the 
majority of female were facing. Although everything has both sides, the
pros and corns, which is just like a coin gets two sides, each one-sided
view is not justified enough, what feminists have done to female is still
more harmful in the course of women than good.

CNUK4012,3.0,,,,,,Most university degrees are theoretical and do not prepare students for the real world. They are therefore of very little value,"
Admittedly, universities and colleges are academic institutions, and they
are designed to teach students theories mostly. We can not get work
experience from university. Theories that we learn in university are not
enough for us to succeed in our future life. However, it does not mean that
university degrees are valueless; on the contrary, they are extremely
essential, because they indicate that we have learned things we have to
know and our personal quality has reached a much higher standard.
As is known to all, theories we learn in university are core knoeledges
that our forefathers summed up from experience. They are priceless and of
great value, and we must obtain. It will be easier task to keep theories in
memory first then practise in the social world.
As far as I am concern, What matters most we get from university is that we
know how to learn, which is vital for us to succeed in the future. There are
so many things we have to learn on our own while climbing career
ladder. Therefore, I think it is quite necessary we enter the university and
get a degree.
Many students begin to live an independent life after entering the 
university. We can not live with our parents, with our sisters and brothers
lifelong. We have to come out, live independently and live our own
life---That is what life is. Universities provides us a chance to live
independently. While we are preparing to get a university degree, we are
learning beng independent. In this aspect, we may say university degrees are
of high value.
After entering into the university, students get along with 
teachers, classmates and roomates; we also begin to make new friends. Each of
us is a social unit; it is our duty to get on well with others--this is a
life skill. Students become more polite, more considerate and more patient
after one year or two years' life in university. we have got that everyone
is a unit and everyone has his\her own idea. We should repect them. It is
obvious that university is a good place to learn this social skill.
Studying in university, we always see differences we never seen before. We
broaden our mind and vision here, and become knoeledgeable and sapient
gradually. We have got our own ideas; we can identify what is right what is
wrong. we know what we should do and what we shuld not.
perhaps university degrees do not value themselves very much; but beyond
degrees, we can really get a lot of things of great value. Therefore, I do
not agree the idea given at the beginning of my essay. University degrees
are extremely important and we ought to work hard to gain the entry into
university, and also take every effort to perform better in university.

Nowadays, most families have televisions, lots of people believe that
watching TV is a good way to relax, they think watching TV widen their eye
reach and they can learn a lot of knowledge from TV. In most of countries,
some people stay in the presence of their television more than 5 hours
everyday. Therefore, in recently years, some people think that television
is becoming the opium of the masses in modern society, and other people
still believe television has a lot of benefit to modern life. I agree with
the second opinion although modern TV programs have a lot of problems.
Some people think that with the development of TV program and the 
competition of television stations, some TV stations
do some strange TV program to please the audiences such as invite a famous
person join the TV program and make a show of the famous person, or when a
terrorism attack happened, some TV program let audiences guess how many
people will died in the terrorism attack and the winner can earn pretty
penny and so on. Maybe in some ways it can improve the audience rating and
make audiences happy, but this kind of TV program will hurt some people
and bring some negative influence to the modern society. If young people
always watching this kind of TV program too much, they will think make
game of other people is very interesting and they will do not mind hurt
other people's heart. On the other hand, some of TV programs are full of
violence and sex. It is not suit for all of audiences, and will bring some
bad influence to the young people.
In my opinion, television is a production of developed science and 
technology, people create television is fin the interest
of humankind but not contaminate the society. Although there are a lot of
problems of the TV programs, I think it is not television's fault.
Further more, television is certain to bring a lot of advantages for the
modern society. For example people can know what important things happen
in this week but do not need to buy a newspaper or walk out their living
room. They can watching the greatest scenery but do not need take their
baggage and travel around the world. They can know which kinds of products
are they need but do not need walking in the crowded street and go to the
shopping center. They can get a lot of useful information and learn a lot
of knowledge from television but do not need to reading books or finding
information in internet. They also can have a good mood by watching a
comedy or kill time in a boring weekend.
So that, I think television is not the opium of the masses in modern
society. As a coin has two sides, at the same time of television bring a
lot of benefit, it will bring some problems to the society, I think people
should think about how to solve this kind of problems but not forbid
masses to watching TV.

Nowadays, TV programmes become more and more rich and colourful. Most of people like watching TV. Watching television is the common activity which people usually do on their lesure time. Every family has a television. Some people say that television bring them a lot of fun and watching TV is a good way to spend their time. Some of them even say they can not live without TV. So some people say that television is the opium of the masses in mordern sociey. Both of the opinions are reasonable to some extent. Therefore, we should discuss this question intently.
In my point of view, everything has its advantages and disadvantages. So does televesion. On the one hand, it is no doubt that TV is a great invention. It is very covenience, we can know about the news of all over the world at home. It bring people not only a lot of fun but also much knowledge. As we know, there are many channels and programmes on TV, some of them are very insructive, we can learn many new things and kowledge on them. For exmple, some programmes are about learning foreign language, some are about geography, some are about the nature, and so on. Each person who have different interests can find the right programme on TV. All of these programmes are very owrthwilhe to watch. Watching TV is also a good way of pastime. There are series and films on TV , many people like to watch TV after dinner. This is a nice way to relax themselves after working as well.
On the other hand, TV are not always good for us. Some people like watching TV all night without rest, this is not good for heath. TV has become their addiction already. so that is why someone say TV is the pium of the masses, especially for the children. Some of the children are spend too much time on watching TV and do nothing else. It is no good for their health. Some of them even addict to TV and watching TV all day. Furthermore, some of the TV programmes are bad, for instant something about violence and erotisism. These programmes are harmful to children's heath of mentality. The children do not know whether the programmes are suitable for them or not. And some of them will imitate the wrong thing from TV, it will be very dangerous.
In conclusion, TV is an useful thing if we watch it in the proper way and right time. Do not spend over time on watching it. Do no watch the bad programme on it. There are not only instructive programmes but also bad programmes on TV. So we should know how to select them. We should pay attention to the children and prvent them to watch that kind of bad programmes. If we can do so, TV would not be the opium.It would be very useful and make our life more colourful.

It is true that television has already become an essential part of people's lives, providing both information and enjoyment. However, with the development of society, an increasing number of people state that television is the opium at present.
On the one hand, there is less time to communicate each other, even though the family, due to the television. Since the birth of television, people have spent much time to watch TV programs. People also have become lazy, they would rather to stay at home with television instead of going out for a walk or do some sports. It is harm to eyes if people watch TV programs for a long time because of radiation of television, especially children.
In additional, there is a serious problem in recently years that TV broadcasting companies are in the crazy pursuit of audience ratings, so some low quality programs flood the TV screen, for example, violence films and porno film. These unhealthy films effect upon young people and cause a lot of young people imitate the film stars. The worst thing is many young people are addicted to television that they neglect their study or work.
However, the television also has its strength points. In the first place, the popularity of television makes it the most effective channel of communication. Nowadays, it is common for a TV-broadcast Olympic Games to have billions of people sitting in front of that little screen cheering their countries. This would have been unimaginable in the days of traditional media such as books, theatres and films. In the second place, television has no rival in the speed of information communication. When a historical event happens anywhere in the world, television is alsways the first to convey this message to people.
Moreover, the television is crammed with all kinds of advertisements in which there is a great deal of useful information. In terms of advertisements, people can know lots of popular appliances, fashion clothes and other kinds of commodities. Therefore, it is easy for people to compare and choose the better one when they decide to buy one of these goods.
At the same time, the television is being appropriate tools for entertainment and education. For instance, when students return home after a long and busy school day, they want to seek some fun to relax, the entertainment of television will be a good choice. For another thing, there are more and more educational programs in the television, including from primary school course to university course. These programs are being a guide for people to learn.It is very useful for people who can not go to school to study.
In conclusion, television is very useful in modern society, it can not be a opium if people can control the time of watching TV program by themselves.

CNUK4019,3.5,3.5,,,,,Television is the opium of the masses in modern society. Discuss.,"
Whether or not television is the opium of the masses in modern society is a very controversial issue at present time. According to a recent survey, about 75% of the interviewee agree that television becomes the opium of the masses. They believe that watching TV has already become an important part of their lives. In this essay, I intend to discuss this issue and consider argument from both the supporter and opposition person.
On one side of the discussion is that television becomes the drug of the masses in modern society. There are numerous reasons responsible for it, but can be divided into three categories.
First of all, watching TV will kill people's creativity and imagination. Some people who are very lazy will deal with things by methods which come from TV they watched. They never think about why they do like that and whether the method is right or not. Secondly, watching TV might make people take fantasy for reality. Some people who do not satisfy with their actuality will lose theirselves in watching TV in order to escape the truth. They prefer to believe in things happened in television rather than believe in the actuality. For instance, love, there are lots of beautiful and romantic love stories in television which cannot come to truth, but some people, especially young people set the love which happened in televisions as their models. Actually, they are trying to catch something are not realistic. Another terrible thing is that more and more violence and sex are broadcasted on television nowadays. Children are one of the biggest groups which are influenced by the blood in the screen. As we all know, childhood is a learning age, children eager to imitate things what they saw without knowing it correct or not. The best example is the shooting event in middle school in America.
On the other side of the discussion, television improves the relationship of family and friends. A concrete example is that watching TV provides us opportunity to be together and communicate. For example, watching TV not only simply provides a chance for people to stay together, but also talks intimately about television programs and share the happiness with each other. Imagining the TV disappears, we would do reading in rooms, while our family would do laundry, do washing dish or going shopping. Live becomes boring.
In addition, the TV supplies us with much new information which we have not known in our daily lives. Some of the television programs such as family stories and love stories which show on TV can enrich our knowledge, enlarge our vision. Moreover, we learn from the story that it is important to absorb other's experiences.
In conclusion, watching TV not only improve the relationship of family and friends, but also supply us with much new information and absorb other's experiences. However, we must aware that watching TV may lead to many problems related to less creativity, the unreality and the violence. Therefore if we are fully aware of the long-term effects of television is the opium of the masses in modern society and take effective measures. I am confident that conditions will improve.

Whatever you go into any working place, you will find that lots of people have got the high qualifications on their university degrees. Althouth these people own the advanced knowledge and latest technology skills, the managers still desmiss them occassionally. Because sometimes they do not know the developing trend of the company,sometimes their knowledge is not suitable for the previous situation in an organisation, sometimes they will find there is a special relationship between the colleagues, even they donot know the basic knowlege about their life,such as Health and Safety Law, punctual policy and so on .
The majority of the universities still pay attention on the exam education, not the practical activities. Usually , the tutors give the lectures or the sem to the students in the campus, then they give them assignments and projects to practice, and send them the handouts to read by themselves or ask them to read the books in the library about their course particularly. Finally they prepare the revisions for their exams on their courses. It is obvious to see that the students' studying life are all arround their course, mostly the knowledge are all from the books or the teachers. Students only learn these knowledge and use them in their assignments or their exams. In fact, usually teachers and students do not use the knowledge which they have got already in the proper position in the different department at the working place, such as the production line, human resource department and so on. In this case, the students do not know whether the knowledge they have learned is suitable for the job that they have expected. So after they graduate from the unvierstiy , they will find their high university degree is useless when they applicate the job that they wish. That is the reason the manager sack them or they should participate in the training course in or out of the company, or they should work in the very low position in the company. For exmpale, sometimes a person who have got the doctor degree, they still have to engage in the basic work in the beginning.
In addition, some universities are keen on their achivements on the high degrees percentage. They do not consider the situation of the students, they just give the knowlege to the students, and they are only responsible for the students to pass their final exams. They do not care about that what they have taught. For these universities, their hornor is the high rank in the final assessment of the universtiies.
There is a very common phenomenon in the university, which is some students when they graduate they do not even know how to fold the quit, how to tidy the room, how to regulate their life, how to cook,etc. These students only have the abilities and skills to study. They do not how to deal with these problems then then take part in the job, and sometimes their living habit or their behaviour will be their obstacle to their career. They cannot cope with the complex social relationship when they are working, these are all their stumbling stones.
On the contrast, some students who just graduate from the high scholl or college, they can obtain the high positon in the company, compare with the peer group who had got the high university degrees. Because the former students have got more working experience, and more interrelated information on their job. If they perform very well and be pleased to study the high technology in the company. As the manager, they prefer to promoting the old employer than using the new staff who they are not familiar with them.
In sum , from my point of the view, I strongly agree that most university degrees are theoretical and so not prepare students for the real world. Besides, I think every university shuold obey the policy which is "" everything should come from the practice."" According to the real positon in the woking place and students' situation, the universities carry out the relevant principles of teaching.

Television is very important in our daily life. Through television people could know more information about the world. In some countries, watching television is the cheaper way on entertainment. Nevertheless, there are some disadvantages of watching television.
Television makes people lazy. In Hong Kong, many people like watching television. They spend 6 to 10 hours on watching TV every day .They like watching TV soap operas, news and even advertisements. In Hong Kong, there is more than one television in each family. They would have one in their bedroom, dinning room or even washroom. They like watching television while eating dinner. It is a very bad habit .All family members only sit in front of the TV, addict to the TV soap opera and do not talk with each other. Furthermore, Hong Kong people willing to stay at home and watching TV rather than doing some outdoor activities, especially children. In holidays, children do not like to go out and do some exercises, they just want to stay at home, watching TV and eating some delicious snack such as potato chips, ice-creams and cakes. Therefore, overweight is a common problem among Hong Kong's children. Additionally, children spend more times on watching television than doing their homework. Most parents do not allow their children watching TV until they finished their homeworks.
Besides, too many TV programmes and dramas highlighting violent and sex. In order to attract adult audience, programme's producers usually make some fighting scenes. Those violent programmes and dramas would be harmful to children since they are too small. They could not make a clear distinction between right and wrong. Children are too naive. They would imitate the bad behaviour of the character. The most obvious example is school violence. School violence is a very serious social problem in many places such as U.S.A and Hong Kong. Because of the influence of violent dramas, children trend to use violence to solve problem. In U.S.A, there were some students used gun to kill their classmates and teachers. In Hong Kong, High school students would fight with teachers or group together to bully the other students. They would use the recorder to record the process and upload to the internet. It is very horrible. Indeed, TV just like an addictive drug makes people crazy.
Even though television is our close friend, in other senses, it could still be our bad friend if we do not develop a good habit on watching television. We should pay attention on selecting TV programme. We should complaint if we think that the TV programmes are harmful. Parents should choose some meaningful TV programmes to their children, accompany them on watching TV and give some guideline to them. As a result, we could obtain more benefits from television.

As the global economy grows very rapidly in the 21st century, people tend to be more demanding for educational qualification. University education turns to be a valuable asset in our society, which is always highly advocated ""Value-added"" development among different industries. Compared with the old days, the chance of having tertiary education is more common for students nowadays. Some people wonder if the value of university degree is truly practical for students to acquire competitiveness power for the highly competitive labour market.
It is true that university degrees are rather theoretical in compared with the actual working practice in the real world. In university degree programme, it aims at teaching students' foundational knowledge for some particular subjects, training up their analytical power and logical thinking. Learning theories are of course inevitable. Once students acquired the theoretical foundation of a subject, they can then further develop their interest, talent and ability in a particular field of study through academic research. While in our workplace, employers never ask you about what theories you have learnt from university degree. What they are looking for could be only your interpersonal skills, flexibility at work, language power or computer literacy which all are not theoretical stuff. Most fresh university graduates may find that what they have learnt from the lectures cannot be applied into the real world. Some may even think that the academic learning is not feasible at all in actual working practice. It is said that university degrees cannot equip students well with what the labour market is actually looking for.
Even though some graduates may criticize what they have learnt in university are inadequate or even not practical for the real business world, does it really mean that university degrees are with little value? Here I have some reservations. To a large extent, university degree can still prepare students' competitive power for the real world even though it uses the theoretical approach to educate students. Here I would like to pinpoint some reasons for my viewpoint.
First of all, the theoretical academic learning aims at building up student's foundational knowledge of a particular subject and stimulating students' logical thinking, research skills, presentation skills, writing skills ...etc. All these skills are exactly what the employers are looking for among most university candidates. All these foundation knowledge can strengthen your understanding in the particular field of study. In the process of studying a theory, it never requires students to memorise all those definitions, spellings and wordy descriptions. Usually most theories are with some underlying assumptions, which are the key elements we concerned about. Students are expected to learn the significances of the assumptions and put them into real practice. In contrary, it highly requires students to apply the theories in the real world by means of research, case studies, academic projects and so on. That is the true value of studying theories. With the theoretical knowledge gained from academic books, research or case studies, it empowers your analytical power, logical thinking and business sense, which are indeed very valuable for enhancing students' competitiveness in the real world.
On top of this, university education highly encouraged group learning instead of individual studies. By means of group discussion, seminar, academic forum, students are highly trained up the communication power, language ability and interpersonal skills etc. In addition, universities always advocates the idea of whole person development which provides students with lots of opportunities to get involved in extra curriculum activities e.g student union, departmental societies or activity clubs in which students can take part in some leading roles in organising activities or managing welfares. With such experience, students' leadership and creativity can be greatly boosted up. These are the good qualities the university degrees prepare student for the real world.
Admittedly, some loopholes are existed in the current university education system. There are still room for improvements e.g to strike a more even balance between theoretical and practical learning in university programme curriculum, input more practical elements such as case studies in academic studies, keep the academic curriculum up-to-date with the local and global market needs.
To conclude, university degree itself is with great value to equip students with all-rounded qualities for the competitive labour market. The criticism ""Most University degrees are theoretical and do not prepare students for the real world"" does not entirely hold valid. The degree of practicality of university degrees for students may vary among different students, depending on how they have fully utilised the study resources available in the three-year university education.

In the generation of information explosive, Television is inevitable in every family. Huge amount of information are delivered through this media, such as news, soap opera, documentary, film etc. People can easily watch what they want by just pressing a button on the remote control. However, some people may say that television is the opium of the masses nowadays. Is it true? 
In most cases, watching TV becomes a relaxation activity. People usually watch TV in their leisure in order to release their working pressure. Therefore, to entertain, broadcasting companies provide soap operas and films to the public. However, what are those films and soap operas talking about? In fact, many of them are puffed out with violence and sex. Many popular films imply the messages that the police force is useless, people have to protect theirselves resorting to force or killing someone who against me. Even in cartoons, violence can also be easily found. For example, X-MEN, Batman, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles and The Transformers. These cartoons are all encouraging the use of weapons. That is the reason why there are always some crimes about teenagers brought guns to school and shot their classmates and teachers without any motivation. On the other hand, sex is also a fatal poison that can be easily found in TV programs. Most of the time, sex is decorated to be very beautiful. If two persons love each other, they can have sex. No matter they are couple or not, they can have sex. The most dangerous thing is : the sequent is always be neglected. Pregnant before marriage, abortion and infection of Sexually Transmitted Disease (STD) become serious problems nowadays. Therefore, in the aspect of content, television is absolutely the opium of the masses.
Besides, television is the opium if people watch it without continence. Since television provides different kinds of interesting programs 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, people can easily lose their control in watching TV. According to the findings of a survey about the time teenagers spent in watching TV which done by the TIME magazine in 2003, the teenagers in UK spent average 3.5 hours a day in watching TV. There are over 20% of 30000 interviewees said that they have been sitting in front of the TV for more than 7 hours in one day. Undoubtedly, non-stop watching TV would certainly affect one's working or studying quality. In addition, spending long hours in TV programs would affect one's working energy, lower the concentration on works.
Nevertheless, television can be useful. People can keep updating what is happening in the world by the news report. In some countries, there are educational TV programs broadcasted by educational department.
However, due to the amount of disadvantages is more than advantages, it is totally logical to say that ""television is opium of the masses nowadays.""

'It is a waste of time watching television.'
'There is nothing good on television, try to do something else instead.'
Very often sayings like these can be heard. It is not rare to have someone who sees the television as a bad thing in the modern society and some even equal television, very unfortunately, with the powerful drug 'opium'.
Those who regard television as opium always complain that there is nothing good on television. They stress that television programmes are broadcast one after the other and thus it is a waste of time watching them. Despite this, a careful study of the daily programme schedule would reveal that the television, indeed, acts as a good source of information. There is a wide variety of television programmes - the news reports give accounts of what is happening in all parts of the world, the financial reports provide details about how the stock market is doing, and the weather forecasts suggest what the weather will be like in the next few days. Given that all these are crucial to daily life, the television conveys a lot of useful information that cannot be missed out.
Apart from giving out the information essential to daily life, the television is an important source of entertainment as well. Talk shows, films, comedies and cartoons provide a chance for viewers to relax and have fun after a busy day's work. Although for some people, the word 'entertainment' has a different meaning - to be with others, like going out with friends, chatting with them at a bar, or doing some outdoor activities together. What is important to note is that these activities, as they have suggested, cannot be carried out alone and have strict restrictions about when and where these can take place. The television, on the other hand, has no such restrictions. It is different, making it possible to be entertained at anytime in anywhere. So it is a major source of entertainment, no matter on one's own or with friends.
Another major benefit of the television is that it can be educational and a lot of programmes on television are meant to be so. Features about scientific researches and documentaries about events in the past all offer valuable learning opportunity to viewers. It is understandable that there may be worries about the quality of the television programmes reducing the educational value they offer, as they are not produced by any education institution. The very fact is that, the government is constantly monitoring the programmes broadcast on television, any programmes that fall below standard would be banned before the television stations can put them on air. As a result, the programmes broadcast on television are up to standard and can offer chances for viewers to gain new knowledge.
The television brings in a lot of advantages. It acts as an essential source of information and entertainment, telling viewers what they need to know as well as generating excitement for them. What is more, it can even be educational, offering opportunity for viewers to learn. The television is, actually, one of the most important inventions ever created in the modern society - it is not 'opium' at all.

CNUK4028,3.5,,,,,,Television is the opium of the masses in modern society. Discuss.,"
Some say television is the opium of the masses in modern society. Why do people say so? Mainly, it is due to its mass influence to the society. In some extends, television stop people from walking out their doors, guide people to material-oriented and self-centred.
In this decade, television becomes an essential item in every family. People are even having a television set in their own rooms. I.e., each family member could enjoy his or her own interested television programme privately. Therefore, different varieties of television programmes are produced in order to suit different needs of every viewer. Today, when you turn on your television, you would have many channels to choose from, such as Sport channels, MTV channels, News channels, Movie channels, etc. The variety of programme is as much as you cannot imagine. Since television programmes have become much more attractive and influencing than ever it is, watching TV programmes becomes a daily routine of many people. In some cases, people even feel sick if they leave the TV off, just because they have already developed an addiction on television.
Probably being addicted to television may not be the whole picture. However, People are spending most of their leisure time or even all their time on watching television rather than doing any other social activities. It is because television provides all sources of information for them to know the world and entertainment to get rid of bore. In such a way, people might turn to self-isolated and non-communicative.
On the other hand, some of the television programmes are really educational, relaxing and worth watching, however, some of them are really bad, which contain for example, disturbing scene or use of coarse language, which are not suitable for all members of a family, especially children. Although there is categories guidance shown in the beginning of those television programmes for viewers, for example, ""Parental Guidance for scene of violence"", how many families are really still watching television together these days? How many kids are really able to receive guidance when watching these scenes? Kids are instilled with the violent behaviours and misuse of languages from time to time; misbehaviours of teenage may be a result.
Besides, there should be no doubt that television is the most powerful advertising media. Nowadays, company uses not only TV commercials to promote itself or its products but also sponsorship on television programmes, like sponsor on actresses' clothing. The effectiveness of the two advertising strategies is not going to be discussed here, but anyhow both of them bring forth a sense of materialism through television.
Nevertheless, some people are counter arguing that television is no long the opium of the masses in modern society since the extensive use of Internet. In my point of view, I believe that Internet has a great deal of influence over the society especially among the teenage group, but speaking of a whole of the society, Television is still in the leading role of influencing people.

CNUK4029,3.0,3.0,2.5,3.0,2.5,3.5,Television is the opium of the masses in modern society. Discuss.,"
Television is said to be the opium of the masses in modern society. According to the researches in recent years, there are figures showing that modern people are addicting to the television, especially the city dwellers. They have nothing to do but watch TV after hours of work in the daytime. But why do they get hooked on watching TV? It could be attributed to a few reasons. We are going to take a closer look at it and find out the reasons behind.
Since the invention of television in the last century, it has become more and more popular through the decades. Not only has the technology of television entered a new era, but the cost of manufacturing a television dropped steadily throughout the years. It has led to the popularity of television. We could see the statistic that every household owns at least two televisions on average in the United States of America. Due to the relatively cheap price, television has thus become one of our major entertainments in the past one hundred years, not to mention its by-products such as videotapes and TV games, etc.
The popularity of television has also boosted the commercial activities by facilitating the propaganda of consumer goods. It has laid the road for the prevailing advertising and marketing of goods in the 20th century. The advertisers have applied all the promotional gimmicks so as to attract as many customers as they could. Most of the advertisements are, therefore, interesting and appealing to the audiences. Some of them are even of great success that making a trend in the society. Since it is inevitable for us to escape from the adverts in today's business world, television, remaining the main channel for adverts, has thus become part of our lives.
Nevertheless, could we then conclude that television is the opium of the masses in modern society? The answer is obviously ""No""! Though there are quite a lot of violence and pornography on television nowadays, we could still find the many beneficial TV programmes. For instance, TV programmes like Discovery Channel, National Geographic Channel and the educational programmes for children are a good proof against the statement.
Moreover, there are lots of supervision units for the content of TV programmes all over the world. There is definitely an international system controlling the quality of TV programmes despite its little variation in the standard of judgment among the countries. In my opinion, the market, itself, is the best indicator of consumers' preference. If one does not like to watch a TV programme, no one could make him do!
Undoubtedly, there is a substantial amount of people addicting to television in the modern society. However, whether television benefits or does harm to a person depends solely on oneself. One does have the absolute power and freedom to choose what he or she wants in a commercial world. Therefore, television is not the opium of the masses. It only plays a relatively neutral role in terms of an information transmitter in modern society.

Television is a great techology in today life, nobody can live without a television, even if we on travel on plane or car, we still get the updata information from the little scream front of us. Nobody can live without it even 3 years old children can tell you 100 of advantage to watch televisions, but is it as useful as we been told by?
""Television is the opium of the massess in modern society"" is the view of most of the parsents and tecahers, althought most of the parsents are try very hard to keep their children away from it, but children's eye can't really take off from the scream. That is also the main reason most oof the children have the eye illness. Not only the children can't take off their eye, even the working people can't as well. Businessmen watch it for getting the updade new from the stock market or the goveronment, housewife get the living style and cooking receipts from it, children have a famous cartoons to watch and most of the non english speaker are use the teletext to learn english, so how boring the life will be if we live without a television with us.
In other hand television is one successful techology which product from the 18th centries. From watching the television, we will be able to know about the news, living style, sports and enternment, is like a ""talking and colouring"" newspaper. People will learn and know lots from it everyday but wacthing. Furthermore, British people are so lucky that they have the most famous and powerful televeision company in UK which is BBC Television. BBC have a long history to product the TV program and the their news are very famous around the world also it been show on most of the plane's TV channel. Rather then that some famous programs like animials living are even showing on other countries TV channels. But is it a good idea to watch the teleision without the normal social life?
As we know, most off the teenager fancy to use internel, from the research showing that the time they spend on the internet are father more then the time they sleep. That is affecting their social skill and the communication skills with the other people. That is the similar situation in here, most of the people been spend too much time on the machine rather then other things etc, even they don't know what program are they actually looking for, but they still will spend the whole hour or night to sit front of it. That why they confuse the time been going past so far, in other words they are weste their time by looking all the rubbish. Although we know the television can change our life of living, but we have to truth that as one of the enternment machine only rather then a main part of life, then that will be more fun and enjoyable to watch it.

Everyday, after a whole day hard work, every time when you feel so boring, every weekend when you want to enjoy some new films but you are too tired to go to cinema, what would you like to do? Television, yes, it can help you relax and entertain you properly.
I believe that television is one of the greatest creatures in the 20th century in the world. It has brought us so many conveniences and delight although we can not deny that also there are some disadvantages exist.
In my opinion, nowadays, the majority of people watch TV every day. We can catch what has happened in the world, we can know what's the weather like in advance, we can enjoy a lot of wonderful films and TV plays, we can study how to cook with some TV programs, we can learn some new knowledge with some educated programs.
Anyway television has become a very important medium in the modern world, to some degree we can not live normally without a television.
Of course, every coin has two sides, no exception of television. According to some news, a lot of people felt that television has made the relationship of family much colder than before, they complained that people presently watch TV everyday after dinner, they reduced conversation and communication, they are not so closed like before. So some problems has been appeared in some families. But I think we also can make our relationship much closer through TV. We can enjoy the program together, we can laugh at the program we can cry for the touching clue, we can share our feeling together, so that we can understand each other more.
Some parents maybe complain that their children like watching TV too much, it is harmful for their health especially for their eyes, that is really a serious problem, as some children do watch TV so much. And some parents worried that some bad program maybe give their children bad influence. Their worries are reasonable. But I think as long as the children can watch TV under the correct instruction, that will be beneficial for them. TV can give them more knowledge and more imagination. I believe that some good program can discover more of your potentialities.
As the developing of technology, more and more advanced televisions were produced. Some of them are very small you can bring them with you wherever you go, you can get the latest news and information in time. Some of the new televisions are very big, you can watch a VCD or DVD at home, the result just like seeing a film in a cinema, but you need not go to the cinema, it can save you money and time and make you freer.
In one word, I am convinced that the advantages of television are much more than the disadvantages, only if you can use it correctly. It is not a really opium, that is a great invention.

Some people say that in our modern world there is no longer a place for dreaming and imagination. This opinion is very similar to mine. I would say that there is a place for dreaming in our world but it still disappears.
It is true that not only science technology is blamed for that state. Not only technology and industralisation rob a man of time for dreaming and own notions. It depends also on the individuals themselves. Many people live in a hurry. They are swallowed up the time. They adapted and got used to living and acting like robots. Dreaming, imagination do not exist for them. They perceive only dry everyday reality. Of course, it is necessary for a man to survive nowadays. I agree that we must perceive the reality of the present days carefully but ...... Is it really all for our life on the earth? Is it really the most important thing for us to live a happy, satisfied life? No, in no case. I think this kind of people is deprived of something unreal, which is born only in our heads.
Dreaming and imagination help a man to have own secret world and look at the real world by rose-tinted spectacles. It is pleasant, beautiful, especially when we are feeling bad and sad. Everybody has its ups and downs? An escape to dreaming often seems to be a miracle or a medicament for the tender spots.
I should say that there are differences among people. Some of us are too emotional, romantic, they live over every situation. On the other hand some of us are rationalists. They are far enough from dreaming, emotional feeling. Maybe they think that dreaming is not suitable for the modern world. Some of them are ashamed of that. They consider it anachronism. Is it truth at all? Believe me, I know the people like that.
The emotional individuals like dreaming very much. It plays a great role in their life style, in spite of the fact that the time is cruel and merciless to romanticists. It is clear that it is not good to be too romantic, emotional, dreamy. Unfortunately this world does not belong to dreamers.
I think a man should be a half of a romanticist and a half of a racionalist. Then s-he is a happy being. In my opinion everybody dreams. Somebody had a dreaming time in its childhood, especially in the mature age. Teen-agers have their heads full of dreams, their feelings are in contrary to the real world. They feel unsatisfied, disappointed, lonely and so on. We, adults know and understand that. It is natural behaviour of adolescents.
What is an attitude of schools to imagination? How do the institutions for education develop pupils' and students' imagination? A traditional school is the traditional one. Unfortunately most educational institutions lag behind with the developing of imagination which is one of the most necessary parts of education. Why? The young generation will soon become a leader in our society and it is important to be able to develop imagination not only in our private life but also in all spheres of a social life.
Most schools neglect the creative side of children. Theoretical information, learning by heart are more prefered than own creativity of children. I should say that there are several new educational institutions in the Czech republic which try to develop mainly creativity, imagination/own opinions, attitudes, ideas/ of their charges. They want to be based on the different bases than the traditional schools.
I think family, parents have a big influence and responsibility to develop their children's imagination, creativity. They are the first teachers of their offsprings. But many families are not aware of that task. Many parents do not pay attention enough to their children.. The do not speak too often about children's problems, notions, ideas, dreams, opinions. It is true that women-mothers are always busy. It is not only important, useful but also beautiful to talk to our offsprings. They surely wait for it. The small children like to open their hearts and parents have a chance better to recognize them. I have the idea that the hours spending with a child are never wasted. They are the happiest ones.
I would like to make the conclusion of the topic. This one was very interesting for me. I would wish the human qualities as own creativity, imagination, dreaming, feeling; the ability to put oneself in the place, live over something and so forth will win over the mechanized world full of the human robots.

CZKR1003,3.0,3.0,2.0,2.5,,,All armies should consist entirely of professional soldiers: there is no value in a system of military service,"
In this rational world where almost everybody seems to think rationally especially about things concerning money 1 have sudendly found that people act highly irrationally if they have non-professional army. Every professional army draws a big sum of money from national gross product. And what about non-professionai armies? If they have every single year new men. And they are not trained and prepared to work with military hardware as the professional soldiers. They can easily cause a great damage or misfortune. 1 know several cases when a soldier injured or even killed his colleague because he did not know how to operate his gun properly. What a luck we do not have nuclear weapons. Military service lasts for one year now. 1 think that in such a short time period soidiers are not able to acquire habits how to do their job correctly. 1 think if they were professionais they would not need as much money as they do now.
But the question of money is also closely connected with the time that the young men have to spend in their military service. All of them have just finished ther studies, their training for their future jobs which they want to do ali their lifes. They have been trained, they have been prepared, they are ready and they have to fullfill their honourable duty - to lost at least one year in some nonsense institution that is calied army. lfyouareforexamplecvilengineeryouwilispendtheyearlistenningtosome orders instead of projecting new buildings, bridges, etc. After this year you will forget a great part of your universit knowledge. If you wants to run your own business and you a great idea, you almost have the money you need and it is the right time for you to start you have to put it off till next year and it is usually late. And the same goes for any other occupations - teachers, carpenters, doctors, artists, bricklayers.
And the worst problem with military service have the young marrages with children. Some of them got married during their studies at universit. They do not usually have their own fiat and their have to live together with their mothers and fathers-in-law. Terrible. They do not have enough money because he or she or both of them have just graduated. They cannot find a job. Their child is often ill. Mother usually stays at home with the kid at least for a year or two. And in such a situation father has to do his military service. Of course, he can ask for deferment. He can get a deferment for a couple of years. And the government promises that in such cases father will be placed near the family, not further than 20 kilomtres away from their hometowns. But ib 1 know a family where the husband is more than 200 kilomtres far from home. Their military service lasts only for five months. What can they learn in such a short period? The officers often know it and so the solders just spend 5 months killing their time by reading books or lying on the beds and doing nothing. What is the reason of taking away the head of family? The only person that is able to earn some money. Well, the family gets a smala amount of money from government but it is only minimum of living standart.
So I say: ""Let""s stop the military service. And what more. Let's dismiss the army at all.""

CZKR1004,3.0,2.5,,,,,All armies should consist entirely of professional soldiers: there is no value in a system of military service,"
People have waged wars since the very beginning of their history and we can never explain why - simply God made us free to choose between good and evil. Many people have always been choosing the latter and the others have had to defend themselves. At first men had to protect their families and small communities from conquerors or plunderers. They knew exactly who they fought against.
Some time later big politics started to play the most important role. Emperors put together their mercenaries; these were the first proffessional armies. There were people who wanted to make money this way or who enjoyed this way of life.
Then another historical break came: someone introduced compulsory military service because the proffessional armies armies were not enough for more and more wars. Till now men in many countries have had the duty to serve in the army and in case of war to kill people. This duty has often been called a matter of man's honor, an opportunity to show one's patriotism etc.
The problem is that men fought because the mighty decided to solve their political problems by war. Even when a State started a defensive are men had to kill other men and the abstract idea of the other State violating their peace did not help them much. The other men could have been their peers, they may have had the same opinions, the same ideas, they may have had wives and children and soldiers defending their country had to kill them though they had nothing against them except that their political leaders had sent them to war. The impersonal kind of war had its peak in WW2. After that it looked like another war of this kind was being prepared. But fortunately the cold war ended peacefully. The wars of present time (Bosnia) seem be similar to those old wars of man against man.
Logically, the next period should be a period of peace, not only because people will choose to be good but also because they will realize that another war would be the end of the mankind. This means that no armies would be needed. Is that possible?
The future will show us whether people are able to grow up. Before this mature period comes armies will have to exist. It is however obvious that forcing people into army is a violation of human rights. There are various reasons fro rejecting the military service. It may be your religion, your character, unwillingness to fight or just a fear that you won't be able to sustain psycliniclal and physical hardships of military service and though you have the theoretical right of any religion and philosophy you cannot use it. This is a big paradox of modern period: you are proclaimed to be free and from your childhood you are encouraged to think and act freely, but actually you cannot really do so in your life because there are many things you can't avoid such military service. That's why the solution would be to introduce proffessional armies in all the countries of the world. A partial solution of that problem was the introduction of the alternative military service in some countries including the Chech Republic. The concept of it is that those who can't cope with the standard service must take a job in the place where they live. It is usually a sort of medical or socially beneficial work that is twice as long as the standard service. So there is a way to avoid the army. Still we should understand it as a temporary state before forming solely proffesional armies. And finally, the time when there are just proffessional armies can be understood as a temporary state before we do not need any armies at all. We can only hope that this time will come.

The human imagination has been till now the most perfect and unbeaten computer of the world. After all brainwashing by computer games, video, TV and mass advertising it can't be replaced by any computer or robot.
Really? Is it really still true? I remember a sci-fi story which I've read several years ago. A lonely woman, operator, by chance got acqainted with a man by phone. Their phone-calls became more frequent and the woman thought that she had finally fond someone, she would like to stay with, someone who understands her and accepts her. What was strange was that the man always avoided meeting her and he didn't even want what he looked like. The curiousity and the desire to see her beloved made the woman search for his phone number. What a shock it was to find out that her friend was a computer!
The present science and technology have accomplished so incredible things that we could even hardly dream about several years ago. Scientists experiment with so delacate materials as the genetic information and brain cells are. Don't they fear that once they'll reach the top, they'll have created a perfect robot which will be not just a perfect copy of human body but also a copy of human feellings and ideas?
Some people say that in our modern warld there is no longer a place for dreaming and imagination. But on the other hand there is exactly the same number of people who thing just the opposite. They realize very well the danger which goes along with the technical progress. They try to draw our attention to it and fight against it with their own means.
Arts have always been a way of a balance and resistance to modern world. Artists have been expressing their opinions towards science and technology. Apart from a few euforic periods when they glorified them they usually warn against them. Take Jules Verne as an example. How many of his utopic visions have come true! Certainly many sci-fi writers could have become the prophets of modern era.
Remember how many poets wrote ethusiastic poems about technical civilizations. And what conclusions did they arrived at in the end of their work? They usually glorified the nature and natural life of people far away from the technical world.
Why are present people becoming more and more interested in ancient myths, philosophy and religoin of the Orient? Perhaps it's the archetypal need of man to whom modern science failed to answer the most crucial question of human existence, the need return to the very beginnings when the white was white and the black was black.
Look at the present film production. What makes a commercial film successfull? The story which is put into an interesting setting somewhere in the Universe, exotic country, ancient history or unexisted world of fairy-tales, shortly in the environment which we can hardly know and which incites our imagination, But this presentation and imposition of some topics could be risky because the choice of topics for dreaming is limited. If kids are attacked by dinosaurus, turtles and Barbies from all directions their imagination is preset. The children aren't able to choose the right for them. Their parents should protect them from pressure. I know that it isn't easy to persuade children with quite a high level of technical education that the magic carpet and wand existe. But they also long for romantic stories. If some classic film fairy-tele appears in cinemas it's always a box-office draw.
You needn't be a fanatic freudian to understand that human creativity and taste have their roots in the early childhood or what you learn in the childhood accompan you for whole your life.
But there is another problem. Can arts protect themselves from the influence of science and technology? We know that already exist computer programmes which are able to write books and draw pictures themselves. Could happen that the most important element in arts - the man - will be useless?
Now let me quote several words from I-t'ing: ""We can't loose what really belongs to us even if we threw it away.""
We have strive to protect the most important assets we have - our mind. Once it could be stollen to us.

CZKR1007,2.5,2.0,,,,,Feminists have done more harm to the cause of women than good,"
""Feminists have helped women to be free and independent but they have made them unhappy"". This has been repeated in American media for last several years. Such hints have appeared in Czech press too, though feminist movement has not influenced our society much yet. Susan Faludi writes about this phenomenon in her book ""Backlash: The Undeclared War Against American Women"". She says that many women do not want to call themselves feminists, though they think women's movement is still neccessary. Faludi claims it is not feminists but the continuous campaign of the White House, press and Hollywood against feminism, who are to be blamed for women's unhapiness. Who is right the, Faludi or media?
Nothing in life is so simple. The answer is much complicated and the causes of the problem lie deep in our minds. People of the end of the 20th century are used to systematic thinking. The flow of information is overwhelming and we are afraid of the complexity of the world. That's why we need to put everything in a group: works of arts, ,people, their opinions, ideas. Everything has to be classified, everything has to be clear. If you say something that is considered a feminist idea, then you are proclaimed a feminist. If you say something against feminists, you are proclaimed sexist. Never mind what your doings are; what other people think you are - that is what matters most. This systematizing the world brings people relief; they believe they have beaten the complicated and hardly understandable world. But the result is not so pleasing: we do not understand one another.
Why don't we understand one another even when we use the same words? We speak in categories and classes when we discuss a problem. But everybody has a slightly different idea of the same category or class and eventually we do not speak about the problem but about what we mean by our words.
We can use a metaphor to describe this incident: we buy wine according to the label on the bottle (without being able to tell the difference), and also we do not discuss the quality of wine but the brand of it.
As far as feminism is concerned, the result of such attitude is blaming feminists for women's unhapiness. What is actually feminism. It came into being in 19th century when women were totally dependent on men, could not vote and work. Suffragettes are also classified as feminists (this women's movement at the turn of the century became famous for its agressivity), as well as other movements in the 30s or 60s, some of them very radical. S. Faludi says that during the feminist revolution in the 70s feminism was understood as an effort to bring women the same rights that men have always used. Carola Biedermannova; a Czech feminist answers the same question this way: ""Feminism is making women's economic, political and social rights work in real life."" Those definitions are the same as one definition in Webster's dictionary: ""organized activity on behalf of women's rights and interests."" But definition 2 says that feminism is the theory of the political, economic and social equality of the sexes.
Well, what do we mean when we say someone is a feminist? Does that mean that he or she fights for women's rights or that he or she only believes in the equality of the sexes? We cannot blame a group of people for something when we don't even know who belongs to this group.
No, it is not feminist's fault that some women are unhappy. It is obvious that women needed their movement because they were not socially free. Now they are or at least they can e. If they are unhappy, it is neither feminists' nor anti-feminists fault. The reason is in them and in all of us who cannot get rid of the old view of woman. Our attitude towards woman does not accord her new position in society. But this is not a political problem, it is a problem of human culture, a problem of bad communication.
We should strive for making our communication work again. It is no use to contemplate whether someone fits to a certain category, either feminist or sexist. We should rather try to listen to what he tells us and how we can help him. Then we will understand one another.

CZKR1009,3.5,2.5,,,,,"In the words of the old song: ""Money is the root of all evil""","
Money - for one a big trouble for another a possibility to buy almost everything. Since it has been established money became a need for all people.
Money is a reward for our work, money can be a theme of a novel or a film, sometimes money is also a scale of somebody's success or station and unfortunately money can be a reason of a crime. You can hate it you can also condemn it but you must have it because you need it. Where is the mistake? In money, man, in human society, in economy or in government? I do not know and I also do not now any solution because I can not imagine a society without money yet - it was only a communistic Utopia. Money is still needed to assess results of human work but I think that society should lead each person to arrange his or her own scale where not money but morale is in the first place, where human life has the greatest value, where love and human honour can not be bought for money.
Money is important in our contemporary society but it is not the most important thing. Who says that money is not weighty he or she is a dreamer. Without money you unfortunately can not buy meals, clothes, books, car, house, flowers or a small thing which makes you pleasant. I thing that money can make one independent. You need not live in a stereotype, you need not be worried about your job, salary, accounts and debts. You can take holiday everywhere, you have much more opportunities how to spend your leisure time. But you can not buy love, health, friends or feelings.
Who affirms that money is the most important thing he or she is an agnistic person without possibility to feel something or believe in something or somebody, he or she became a slave of money and he or she would de everything to have it. People like this exist all over the world. They can kill because of money, they can steal and rob, they sell drubs to young people, they organise prostitution, they do business with arms and weapons, they blackmail others, there is a coruption in this world - this is that evil because of money; Why does it exist? I do not know why but I mean that the evil is not money - this is only reason - the evil is in people.
But I believe that people can overcome it. They have to improve relationships among them, they should regard each other, they should not avoid feelings, they should educated their children in love and in morale and in respect of our life and life of other people, they should teach their children to find the real beauty in small, common, everyday things. They should believe in something. People should not measure a person according to his or her money, they should find inside them because not that one who has the most money must be the best but the one with the great personality.

CZPR2001,1.0,3.0,,,,,Feminists have done more harm to the cause of women than good,"
I will try to prove this statement by giving an example of the law of Domestic Violance, which is often regarded to be a great success of the feminist movement. During my visit to the U. S. this fall, I had a chance to experience an interesting situation concerning the law of Domestic Violance. I will tell you a story, which didnt happen to me. I heard it from a person, whom it happened and I know this person rather well. The law of Domestic Violance (understand in California because I think that each state has a slightly different one) may be a good way to get rid of an uncomfortable husband. All of this happened about 2-3 months ago. A wife together with her boyfriend, a former wrestling champion, arranged a plan how to fire her husband from their common residence. As several times before, the wife provoked her husband by cutting by a pair of scissors his credit cards, which arrived in the afternoon mail. To defend her I have to add that these credit cards were common for both of the wife and the husband and that she didnt want to be a part of them. They had several quarrels about it before. So, the husband started to yell at her just in time when her boyfriend was approaching the door with a not too well acted friendly smile. ""How are you, guys, doing ? I was just passing, so I thought ..."", he tried to explane. But soon he changed his tone of voice because the wife told him : ""Nick, he hit me and held me under my neck !"", she pretended. Her boyfriend, twenty years older than she is, but still in a good shape after many years of his wrestling career, started to tremble with anger. ""You, get out of here or Ill kill you. I used to kill people for four bucks during the war in Vietnam, you know ! "", he threatened. He was getting more and more nervous. So, the husband didnt hesitate a minute. He left the house immediately without saying a single word. He didnt want to get hurt or provoke that silly old man. After he left, they called the police together and reported that the husband hit the face of his wife and held her neck. The restraining order has been signed by the judge that the husband cant get closer than 100 feet distance to his own house. What a terrible surprise it was for the husband, when he returned home the next day. The door lock was changed and nobody was at home. So he went to his wifes boyfriends house to get the keys. He thought that his son might have been playing there. He didnt know about the restraining order. His idea was to take some things from his home and move to his friends house before things come to order again. But what happened was really a painfull shock. His 12 year old son, manipulated by his mother and ""uncle Nick"" shut the door in front of his fathers face and called the police. The restraining order was valid for the boyfriends house also. The disappointed husband and father was lucky to escape. He couldnt believe what had happened to him. He remembered the days he spent with his son. There werent many because he worked hard 7 days a week. He remembered how he was buying his new house, all the things he bought to equip it ... What happened to him doesnt happen twice in life. Now there was no possibility for him to return home. There was really no save area in the whole situation. This story seems unbelievable but the worst thing about it is that it happened "" in accordance with the law "". Practically, he couldnt appeal against the judges decision. He didnt have any witnesses, while Nick would say or do anything to gain the wifes liking. He could have hired a lawyer to represent him in a case but with all the charges etc. He decided to let things go by their natural way. Such a case would cost him a lot of money. Actually, with the law as it is, he didnt have a chance to succeed, anyway.

CZPR2005,1.0,2.0,,,,,"Some people say that in our modern world, dominated by science and technology and industrialisation, there is no longer a place for dreaming and imagination. What is your opinion?","
If you make your dreams come true, your desire to be genuine, will be fulfilled.  Since the second half of this century there has been a boom of new technology, new technical material. Modern appliences such as calculators, videos, CD's, etc. have become a part of our daily lives. Children are taught to work with computers at the basic school. One would think that modern technology has overwhelmed us in every aspect. On one hand we must admit that life would not be easy without all this stuff. Imagine, for example, an accountant who would not have an acces to a computer. His work would take much longer, he would spend a lot of time on  papering work  and we would wait ages for his results. Another good thing is video. It can be used for educational purposes, for recording important things but it also can be misused by people who do not do anything but watch video. Unfortunately I can see this tendency more than often nowadays. Even worse thing is that these  people  are mainly children. They come home from school and switch the video on. Sometimes it is for a good purpose for they missed excellent film. However they prefer watching horrors, sexy films, or movies with not much value. TV has become one of the most important things for them. If you have not seen such and such film, you might be considered as a  square  person. The same is with walkman or CD records. You are just not  cool  enough. On the other hand it takes your imagination away. You do not have to think very deeply for the computers can think instead of you and films can bring your dreams desires right into your home. Would you like to go to New Zealand and do not have enough money for the trip ? Well, switch on TV and watch the film instead. It gives you some advantages - it shows you places you would never visit, you can sit in a cosy room, eat sandwiches and yet travel. But then - where is the actual dream to go somewhere, do something ? So far my point of view of imagination, dreaming and fantasy might sound quite negative. I sort of put everyone into one box that is labelled  material society which does not care for its dreams . And yet it is not what I think because I deeply beleive in people's wishes, for their desires and I know most of them at least try to make them true. There are thousands of artists, musicians who could not work or create without imagination at all. Take for example fairy tales'authors. The books are beautifully narrated, a child or anyone who reads them meets nice kings, pretty princesses, awful dragons that are usually killed by brave princes or knights. One of the things which always fascinates me is that these books are written by adults. Yes, those adults who work with computers, watch TV and video. Those adults who get fed up with their children, those adults who have lots to do and yet they find time and use their IMAGINATION to pass on values to the others. One would say not to others, but to children. It is true until you realize that small children cannot read and therefore the books are read to them by their parents, grandparents, siblings, generally adults or as i call them  older kids . How funny it is to watch enthusiastic eyes of a kid and his daddy trying to imitate a voice of some creature from the fairy tale. They actually  transfer  themselves into a vision, back into their childhood. They have to use their imagination how to imitate the voices, what kind of intonation they must use to attract the listener, etc. It could be though, that we read C. S. Lewis, L. Carroll and others because we do not have ability to put down our own dreams and images. But why not ? Firstly - not everyone is able to write like that and secondly - we can compare different points of view and learn new things. There are films and theatre performances now which have  open endings . Many people go home and say:  What was the point of it ? What did the author try to say ?  And here we come with it - you have to use your imagination. You can make up your own ending. It gives you a space and opportunity to think about it and then make conclusion that is either suitable to your status or is fulfilling the dreams you dream of. And this opportunity is a great advantage because one can expand his or her thoughts, visions.

CZPR2013,1.0,,,,,,"In the words of the old song: ""Money is the root of all evil""","
Money is the root of the evil Does it mean that the evil was born when money became the medium of payment ? No. The evil was there - in people. Money just gave much more possibilities to grew up human vices such as jealousy, greediness, and envy. Money came and society began to differ. People began to make money and to differ from each other. They began to distinguish as for how heavy money - bag they had. Money - market was born. It gave the possibility for such a inborn feature as a rivality is. Money makers began to look for whichever - good or bad - way of geeting money. Everything had to get its money form and such a relative value was getting to be the only value that people accepted. Everything, every work, everyone is touched by money, is valued by money that became the most important value one meets on the way to the real thing, the work and the human being. Of course, people want to compare, to have knowledge of facts so that they do this through their money form of value. But they often forget that it is just a relative value given today, tomorrow it is different. It is not possible to rely on it. Fortunately, a lot of people consider money form as the only value. It causes blindness - stupidity and simplicity. It is comfortable to live for money. People like money, want money and are dependent on it. One cannot have a bread without money. People are dependent on society they live in. Milo Forman said that money gives him freedom. Does it mean freedom in the society ? I think so. One needs money to be free in ones society, to enjoy ones life. One can eat whatever, buy whatever, travel wherever, see whichever performance or movie one wants. Simply - to be happy and free. While people short of money have to check and divide their money among many things they need, want and they would like. So that they have to realize prices, compare them and count and count. To be in a dictatorship of money. When people loose their freedom as for money, it is really the evil thing. Secondly, it becomes the sense of life. It is very simple and stupid. It is dangerous too. People who in a hunt for money are loosing them are near to loosing their lives. But the evil is in people, money just caused confussion in us, in values we have, in society we live in.

Some people say that in our modern world dominated by science technology and industrialization there is no longer a place for dreaming and imagination. What is your opinion ? Art especially music belongs to my life like the sun belongs to the earth. It is a wonderful hobby that encourages and inspires me. Family influences each person and I am really very happy that I can always remember my childhood in the most beautiful colours. My life is saturated with music from the very beginning - my mother is a teacher at music school, she sings and plays the violin and my father plays the organ. As a child I was surrounded by cultural atmosphere all the time. We often went to the concerts or theatres. Music multiplies all my feelings of happiness and mitigates the feelings of disappointment and failure. I think that people who have ever met the wonderful and uplifting muse cannot be cruel or mentaly empty. Even Old Greeks laid emphasis upon art education. Children were taught to read, to write, to do arithmetic but important subjects were also singing, dancing and painting. They had to learn by heart long poems written by Greek authors. At that time people prefered real virtues. And what do we prefer today ? Of course, it depends on each man individually, on his education, abilities, opportunities, enviroment, belief etc. All of us have a possibility to dream, to create our inner beautiful world where we can be happy. But it seems to be very difficult at present time where the basic relations of human morality does not work. We can see just violence, indifference ; nihilism that devours world of fantasy. There is no respect for laws of nature, for  higher order . But if we want to survive we have to subordinate it, because we are just part of this world. We need new scale of values. For instance a book. We often say:  A book is the best friend of man.  Is this saying really true today ? How many people would prefer a novel in a book where they have to think, they need a lot of time to create their own opinion and imagination, to a novel on TV where everything is served in a few minutes ? Or, what is easier ? To stay at home, in an armchair and to watch a piece of music on TV or to get dressed and go to the concert. One of the problems is that most of the people has no need to go for a culture and to meet some new faces. Are they lazy or dull ? They are not willing to communicate. Another good example can be a presentation of a fairy - tale. At that time when there was no television mothers often sang lullaby or told some fairy - tales to their children. These children could have created their own world of fantasy and imagination. Now a lot of fairy - tales were put on the screen so most of us has just one exactly given image of various fairy - tales. Our inner world gets smaller and smaller. We should think about all these things when it is not still late.

CZPR2016,1.0,1.0,,,,,Most university degrees are theoretical and do not prepare students for the real world. They are therefore of very little value,"
Out of non-representative sample of all pupils from basic schools one third - the same amount of boys and girls - wanted to study university. I am speaking about CSSR according to research of 1989. Parents of all children that have been observed considered practical reasons to have influenced them. ` Most university degrees are theoretical and do not prepare students for the real world. They are therefore of very little value. Does it follow that the one third of these children was interested in practical aspects of university adducation and either didn`t know about or mind it`s not preparing for the `real world ` ? Sounds strange. So something is wrong? Had parents known about their children`s fault and warned them university had neither practical value nor it was preparation for the ` real world ` ? How to explain that only 30% of pupils with excellent school achievements and low-adducated parents are going to study school preparing for university and 60% specialized schoools ? With children doing as well in school and having one parent with university degree at least, the proportion is right opossite. After the first research was over 57% of observed children was accepted to study secondary schools. That makes approach to university possible. 38% of scholars claimed they would attempt to study for university degree. Have parents known about little value of university degrees ? Or didn`t they want to ` close the door ` before their children mature and decide themselves wether to study or not ? Did they ask only secondary adducation for their children ? Or weren`t they interested in ` real world ` of their children and desired only practical advantage they hoped degree was giving ? ` They are therefore of a very little value. ` Are they of a value ? Don`t they - university degrees - rather constitute values ? ` They are theoretical and do not prepare students for the real world. ` But they prepare \ theoretical \ attitudes. These change the real world. Thes even change the world that is not real now : these prepare the world for future generation -people without any attitudes, not knowing what is to be attituted to. According to responses of children from working - class families, one quarter of them thought the best way to ` life success ` is to be workful - have frinds - be conflictless. To be workful - adducated and specialized was being chosen as the right way to ` life success ` by children of highly qualified specialists. 60% of pupils haven` t chosen being skilfull in something as the right way to life success : 40% refused adducation as way to life success. Only one fifth have chosen both. Of these children who expressed the highest adducational aspirations, one third didn` t consider adducation important for life success. One half of children with this aspiration did not consider being skilful in something more than the others important for life success. How to explain it? They expect university will not prepare them for practical life? Is it the reason why they have chosen to study for degree ? And what happened than was the missunderstanding between these two generations ? Most parents thought their child`s decission to study university to have been chosen for practical aspects? Or isn` t the question wether to study for degree influenced by thinking about ways to life success at all ? Do children think about life success ? Is there any selfevaluation required? Teachers recommend 80% of children of higly adducated parents and 30% of children of unqolified workers to study on secondary schools. Doesn`t the idea of the way to life success - even when there is no adducation or qualification required - cancel the decission to study for degree ?

14 Some people say that in our modern world, dominated by science, technology, and industrialization, there is no longer a place for dreaming and imagination. What is your opinion ? I will try to answer this question even though I find this problem a litte bit difficult to write about. I do not agree with what  some people say  in this case, but I agree with the opinion that most people do not have any imagination. They even do not dream at all. I see the reason for it in our upbringing and education, not in the world that surrounds us. In my essay, I will try to follow this direction. I agree that our imagination is not as developed as it should be, but I think that it is not a problem of opportunity, I think it is a problem of education. During our childhood we are encouraged to develop our imagination only very little. The education is orientated in problem solving. Even in such subjects as arts or music we are taught to master various skills instead of learning how to use our imagination, how to create something new, something that would express our self. We would use our imagination much more were we taught that it is important and meaningful. Instead we are told all the time that it is only valuable to learn useful and practical things that will help us to build our careers. I do not think that education has ever been orientated in developing imagination. I am afraid this has always been a matter of marginal interest only. And is it really so important to wake our imagination ? If we know and do and think the same things as everybody, we are not personalities. In a way we do not have any opinions or are afraid to talk about them. If we were shown that people differ and that in their differencies they are all of the same value, we would not feel embarrassed to express our opinions and thoughts. If we were allowed to use our imagination, we would soon learn that we each live in a world of our own - and consequently we would learn to know each other and ourselves better. But all these reasons are too practical. The important thing is that it is a joy to explore oneself by using one's imagination. I think that it is not our modern world, dominated by science, technology, and industrialization that makes us forget about our imagination ; we can dream everywhere. We do not dream because we know neither what it is like nor what it is for. And perhaps this is why our world is what it is, dominated by science, technology, and industrialization, not the other way round. And there is another reason why people do not consider it important to be concerned about their imagination ; some people can use their imagination, in spite of the things I mentioned above. These are usually thought grat artists or, surprisingly, great scientists. It is imagination and not skill that divides great artists and scientists from the lesser ones. And there have always been just few. And there can be just few. But it does not mean that if it is not probable that you will become a great artist, it is no good to dream and use your imagination. Is it any good to become more at home in your life or is it not ? I tried to put down some of my thoughts. I hope I succeded - at last partly - in explaining my opinions on this matter. I also hope I succeded in helping you with your linuistic research.

Some people say that in our modern world, dominated by science technology and industrialization, there is no longer a place for dreaming and imagination. What is your opinion ? In modern society most information are conveyed in form of exact data, every theory must be proved by numbers, by ""objective"" statistics (expressed by numbers to). People believe only scientific proves, they seem to be dependent on certain institutions. The main medium in these days is money the value of which is also stated in so called ""objective"" numbers. Contemporary society seems not to bee able to see the reverse side of this coin. As the information is much bigger value these days than it used to be in the past, people are more keen on its quality than ever before. The newest, more objective information are the most valuable. You can persuade other people by means of precise data supported by a serious research or a statistics. Then you can manipulate with them quite easily. Machinery is exploited in this century and computers play still more and more important role in life of the contemporary society. These machines need unambiguous, exact information for their proper working. Functioning of a contemporary society is completely dependent on computers and machines. needs Using computers is inevitable for a society management. Machinery is necessary for production of goods that contamporary society requires for its living. In such a world that is dependent on non - personal equipment and believes only numbers provided by institutions there is a little place for a personal opinion or intuition. It is very difficult to put forward a personal opinion and turn it into reality in life of an individual in a society acknowledging only values like money or information. In society which follows only its own profit and everybody is keen only on utilitar activities nobody is able to think synthetically. People are analyzing the facts and divide them into useful and useless for themselves. Things are simply black or white, good or bad, positive or negative. Everybody evaluates things only by himself and tries to persuade the others that this is the truth. The one who has got most numbers and statistics is the only right person and his opinion is presented as ""the objective facts"" i. e. The Truth. In a democratic society The Truth is a result of a compromise. This is a considerate drawback of such a social system. Truth cannot be a result of a compromise. All things are good as well as bad, it depends on your approach to it. We should know that all things and phenomena are interconnected and associated with each other. People must approach to assesing facts synthetically not analytically, out of the context of these facts. Mysthical tradition of the Middle Ages, old China or Tibet is almost forgotten. But those people who don't feel comfortable in a society, try to return to these tradition. Some philosophers foresee the turning point in thinking of the mankind. Such tendencies like Eastern kinds of exercises, methods of meditation or contemplation, interest in Eastern philosophy or medicine could be considered as the first signs. But this tradition is not domain only for the East. For example st. Francesco from Asissi thought in the same way as taoistic monks as some authors state. This way of thinking which taoists were used to think in is based on a certain kind of a belief. In a society it might be something like trust. Trust in each other. If sombody knows that he or she can trust the other person he (or she) does not need any proves that the facts which the other person is saying are true. Scientific proves are useless. But how can we trust for example an advertising agency ? However they work, some of the methods used by healers cannot be proved scientifically. It is said that the people are healed by their personal belief. Those practices are quite often blamed by classical doctors. Nevertheless, some theories say that people use only one half of their brains. I mean the left hemisphere. This brain hemisphere is specialized on analytical thinking, logic and mathemathic approach to the facts. On the other hand, the right hemisphere is concerning creative thinking, intuition, artistic tendencies. But people are used only to using the left one. This causes a bad ballance in mental work and harm for the person as well as for its environment.

I do not agree that in our modern world is not a place for dreaming and imagination. I believe that everybody either man or a woman has a certain dreams. Without a doubt anybody can imagine almost anything but not all the dreams are positive, not every imagination opens new possibilities. Dreams can differ in various ways. The most common dreams are probably  to have something dreams . Some people can dream about having a lot of money, about a new fast car, about a luxury house with many servants and so on. In my opinion this type of dream occurs in every society in the world no matter if it is a highly developed western country or a small group of people living in forsaken place. We may say about this type of dreams that they do not have any value. We can argue that these dreams are not the pure ones. I do not think that it must be necessarily true. In my estimation these dreams caused also progress and development of human race. It is possible that in our modern world people are dreaming less than they did in some other period of our history. I am sure that it is caused exactly by domination of science technology and industralization. It is very well known that average person spends many hours in front of television every day. Not only adults but children too. We are able to watch almost anything and we do not really realize how badly we are influenced by all those commercial programs. Of course some people say that they want to be well informed and that is why they watch news. Some of them want to have a rest after a hard work so they watch worthless movies. After that their own dreams are suppressed by dreams of somebody else. It can be their favorite heroe or a movie star. How can we have our own imagination if we saw almost everything on the screen ? One of the results of this process is that somd peop\a by dreaming. Sometimes it seems that they live in a different world. These people are full of imagination which can enrich our lifes. For some people it is difficult to get on well with dreamers because of their way of thinking. It is said that dreamers are very often unfit for work or irresponsible. Sometimes it can be true but still the dreamers are very important in our everyday life. Another thing which caused decline of dreaming and imagination is that people do not read so much as they did. Especially poetry is very often rejected. I thing that reading is very important for development of our imagination. When different people read a same book they have probably various imaginations while reading. This process is much more obvious when we read poetry but nowadays not many people are able to read it. We were taught physics and mathematics but we were not taught how to read poems. As I said some adults are losing their ability to dream and to imagine under pressure of modern civilization. I did not speak about children. If we shall learn how to dream again we should just listen and watch carefully playing children. They can imagine unimaginable. They can be whoever or whatever they want to. We should support this wonderful ability. Our imagination and our ability to dream is a secret gift which should be developed not destroyed. We should be aware that this treasure is a large part of our personality which we carry with us through our lifes.

Some people say that in our modern world, dominated by science technology and industrialisation, there is no longer a place for dreaming and imagination. If there was not any imagination, there would not be any dreams and dreamers in the world. And dreamers are the ones who make the world go around. Nowadays, the world is very complicated. It has been developing for thousands of centuries. Science technology and industrialisation became one of the main parts of our world. They make easier our way of living in many aspects. Sometimes it seems to me that the society is therefore rather unhuman. Dreamers can help the world to be human again. All the people have some imagination and certainly everybody has sometimes dreams. If the human race survives, there will always exist the world of dreams and imagination. They keep us from being focused just on the basic things in our life and help to spread our attention to arts, theatre and all other kinds of  the results  of imagination. They can even help to cheer our mood up. I am the big dreamer myself. And what about actors, writers or poets ? They create our imagination and the ability of dreaming by using their own. When I read a book, I always imagine its characters in the reality, I put them into different situations, creating possible features of their characters. I try to imagine myself in their position and compare their ideas with my points of wiev. I do not just read a book, I find myself in it. The world of dreams is actually the part of science technology. How would scientists be able to make a breakthrough if they did not use their imagination and dreams ? The contradiction between the industrial world and the world of dreams is similar to the contrast between money on one side and love on the other. Money became the essential part of our lives and love is the one that comes naturally from our heart. It was not made, it just was. And love will always be among us, people (and not just among people). If you want it or not, one can not live without money. Both love and money will always exist in this world. And that is the same with the industrial world and the world of dreams. They will simply be here as long as the human race will exist on this planet.

CZPR2027,1.0,2.0,,,,,"In the words of the old song: ""Money is the root of all evil""","
In the words of the old song  Money is the root of all evil  At the very beginning I would like to exchange this statement into  Having money is the root of all evil  and look at this from two different points of view. Some people say it is definitely true that money is the root of evil. But why do they thing so ? I had heard many times people say that but when I thought about what kind of people say it I found out that many of them were usually weak by their nature and unable or willing to do something in addition to gain more money. They never had enough money to enjoy their lives - to buy nice clothes, to eat good food, to go for holidays. But it was not because they were unlucky so that to get a good job and earn more money. They were simply not able to do something. Maybe they did not want to. they would like to have a lot of money without any effort. Therefore they started to persuade themselves that money cannot make anybody happy and that having it causes only problems. After some time, of course they believed it. And once they believed that money is good for nothing they had no more need to make an effort to gain better living. From my point of view this is very alibistic. It is an excuse in front of themselves and other people as well for their behaviour. I never believed these people were honest if saying that money is just the root of all evil. I don't thing money is everithing. It cannot happen. There are much important things in life which make life worth living. Everybody needs to feel he is cared for, loved and not useless. Feeling of being the part of somebody 's life, usefull to others. It makes everybody feel self - confident and at ease. But still if you have all of this you need money. Not necessarily millions but without money at all living can never fully satisfy you. Let me talk a bit about my own experience. I like tro have money but not just for my personal satisfaction. It brings me pleasure because it brings pleasure to other people who are dear to me. I like to buy presents for them, not expensive ones but even though they are cheap still I need some money to buy them. I know if I want to do so I have to find a job and work hard. This is the only way how to make life pleasant. I also like to spend money on my hobbies. I thing it is very important too to have hobbies as itoffers a good chance to escape from everyday problems. And hobbies also cost money. Sometimes a lot. Butit is worth spending on it. Doing what I like to do satisfies me and fills me with happiness and in consequence of it I am nice and kindto others and such kind of relationship towards these people can also make them feeling better. Not having money causes just problems. Especially for men it is very difficult to admit that they are not able to encourage their family financially. . They feel completely useless and inferior and such a feeling can have a horrible consequences. The stronger by nature men try to putup with such situation for some time and later if there is no other possibility they admit whichever job just to earn some money. But this is not a real solution for them. They are constantly under the stress and it can affect their health. In case of weaker by nature men such a situation can end up with destroing all their lives. And it all happens just because of the lack of money. Therefore I cannot agree with the statement given above. In those cases money is really needed to help people to live a good life. As each problem has two sides this one is not an exception either. Of course, sometimes having money can really be the root of evil. There are some people in the world whose desire for money is so strong that they are always ready even to kill a brother for it. Fortunately, it does not happen very often. Suchpeople are usually extremely grasping, ruthless and cold. They like to possess money only for the feeling of having it and the consiousness of the fact that they can afford much more than other people. They know if they have money everything is possible. They do not care for anything and anyboby apart from their money. But this is very bad and in my opinion this is not what life should be about. As in many cases a good compromise is the best solution. .

It has been so long since people used to read poetry as an entertainment, since they used to go to the opera instead of going to the cinema as it happens today, it has been so long since people knew the names of the writers, painters and composers of their time, both the famous and the condemned. Nowadays there are computers, videos, CD players, cameras etc., nowadays there is a new and modern world here. We all know the great differences between the life at presence and the life let us say hundred years ago. We know that the time has been changing and that it has been changing fast. We have the things we could not have before but on the other hand we don`t have things we could have before. We no longer travel by carriages and I don`t think we ever will and we don`t invite our friends for the evenings of poetry reading. That all means the time is different but does it also mean that the man is different as well? It`s true that the man is different but still he is the human with his desires and expectations, with his griefs and pains. He is still the man full of dreams and imagination. Some people say there is no place for dreaming and imagination in our contemporary world but their arguments are rather weak. They usually say that we are enslaved by the mass culture and omnipresent modernization or (it`s another frequent point of view) that imagination and mainly dreaming belong to the age of romanticism and it is, after all, gone. It means that only a few romantic souls could be still dreaming in this time and that imagination (according to what people think) is for the artists who we can simply call fools. But this is a wrong idea. We have to realize that there are specific things in this world which can be hardly destroyed by any technology, science or even politics. Imagination and dreaming are such specific things. If you are once born with it nothing can change it. So the problem is not that there is no place for imagination or that there even are no imaginative people but that there is a very bad acceptance of imagination. I mean that many people create something in their minds but often there is no way for them to realize it. I speak mainly about those cases where the imagination is concerned with fine art and literature. And why? Because for example poetry does not make any money. And so we should not say that there is no place for dreaming and imagination but that today it is no time for it. We don`t need no place for dreams, no place for imagination, we all have one: our minds. But we do need to find some way to make our dreams come true. We know it was always difficult but maybe in our time it is difficult little more. Who cares about pictures, sculptures, music, poetry? Who goes to the theatre more often than to the cinema? Who cares about imagination?... It is too difficult to think about those strange things one`s mind can create. It is too boring. Sometimes it is too old fashioned, sometimes it is too modern. After all we have much easier ways to entertain ourselves. It is so pleasant just to sit and watch TV where there is no end to fighting - we don`t have to think so much. We are tired. We have to work because we have to make money. We need money and comfortable easy living. No imagination, there is no time for it. There is no audience.

CZPR2030,1.0,,,,,,"In the words of the old song: ""Money is the root of all evil""","
In the words of the old song  Money is the root of all evil  I can partly agree with the idea in the title of the essay. Both shortage and plenty of money can cause many a misunderstanding among people. In my view, money as a positive or a negative means belongs to man. Money accompanies everyone from his childhood. Family is the first community in which a child meets money. If parents give their son or daughter more money they can await growing children's needs. The open parent's purse leads to loss of orientation in the scale of values. On the other hand, parents can be very strict and give money to them only in the case of their necessity. This time a child cannot know what he can afford if he has some money. The limitation, or generosity does not bring any chance of finding some measure. To me, it is useful to learn to save money from childhood. It means children should get some pocket. I would propose that pupils from 6 to 12 years could get a certain sum of money per week and the older pupils of the elementary school could get some money a month. Students at the secondary school could do some odd - job. They would become partly independent and would try a burden of the everyday job. However, they would partly be dependent on their parents from which they should have some money a month. University students could do some full - time job. I mean my proposal could be one of the ways to get to know the value of money. If I compare my ideal proposal with a situation in our contemporary society I must confess the children's financial dependence on parents is too strong. The historical background mostly helped to develop such human qualities as self - indulgence, ignorance, and parasitism. The mass media (the TV and radio broadcasting, press) bring many pieces of information about misuse of money but their influence can be both positive and negative. All these media offer very wide scale of choice. It depends on a man what he/she prefers. Although for example many TV programmes are full of violence each of us has a right to choose what he wants to watch. This kind of programmes supports the primitive and easy attitudes. There is no creativity nor a positive force in these films. The man who watches these programmes very often can see only one alternative in solution of the complicated situations. Just money and violence are the proper means to them. Why can I only partly agree with the words of the old song in the title ? Money should serve man and so one should influence the use or the misuse of money. The family, the mass media and the educational institutions should be participants in the education of the thinking people - individualities. Perhaps, it is a pity that the people that sing the words of the old song with the title:  Money is the root of all evil  cannot confess their weaknesses. I would accurately make the sentence:  Money in man's hands is the root of evil .

Some people say in our modern world, dominated by science technology and industrialisation, there is no longer a place for dreaming and imagination. What is your opinion ? I hope that every person on our planet had a dream. Never mind if, may be, only once or twice. If you have a nice and happy dream, you would get up with a good vein, your day has a wonderful beginning. On the other hand, a bad or sad dream is an upleasant entrance to the mirning. These two kinds of dreams are only one part of the dreaming, because they are based on our subconsciousness and there are many books written on this topics. I would like to write something about our conscious dreaming and imagination. There is a big group of people in the world who are dreaming. They want to be happier, prettier, rich, healthy, clever and so on. If you are an old, ill and small man - in your imagination - you can dance on the ball the whole night with a beautiful young woman, you can be successfull as a basketball player etc. This is the healthy imagination. It helps you in your ordinary life, it makes you better. It makes you better because your self - consciousness gets higher a little bit and your whole access to your life is more acceptable. You see, that you can do something, if you want to. And you have to do something because your dream is not reality. And there is the problem - many people are closed to the real world and they live only in their own world, in their imaginations. They do not know what to do, where to go. They are happy in their own dreams. They do not look for anything better because they do not know that they need it. Sometimes, when they do not wake up in the right time, they end very sad. They lose everything what they had, they usually begin to drink alcohol, which helps them to forgert the reality. The outcome is not so tragic when they have no family and no relatives. But when they have, the consequence of their behaviour is not very optimistic. They make the family unhappy, they spend all the money, they find, very often. They are selfish and that is why they are left. They do not understand it and they start to dream more intensively. Is it good to dream when we see all these consequences ? There is another group of people in our modern world. They do not believe in dreams and imagination. They do not know what it is because they do not think that they can need it. They have their jobs, their families and that is for them enough. They say:  Why to dream ? I have everything that I want.  But I do not think that it is true. I do not know anybody who has everything that he ever wanted. These people, may be, do not know, that dreaming exists. They are pragmatic, or they think that they are. So, is there a place for dreaming and imagination in our modern world ? I hope, that it is and that it has to be. The proof can we read in books, a film is a sort of imagination of the author, the proofs are in art and in music.

Some people say that in our modern world, dominated by science, technology and industrialisation, there is no longer a place for dreaming and imagination. When you read something about our world there is, almost every time, mentioned that our world is modern. What does it mean ? Is polution, dirty rivers and smog modern ? Simply said, it is result of our modern society, of our need to live safely in a clean house with fine people, to buy nice things and healthy food. Yes, you want to live safely but you drink bad water and breathe poluted air ... which might kill you soon. You think that your house or your flat is safe but unfortunately it is not true. There is no safe place in the world. You know that various prognosis were made in such fields like ecology is. But this does not borther us. We are still safe enough to live and we do not care about our children 's life. Maybe we cannot imagine how will our world look in the future. Without trees, grass, fresh air or whether the Earth is able to exist under these conditions. I must confess that I am worrying about such imagination. It would be better to start to solve the problem from the little pieces of the world which are living and surviving and which are very important for our future. They are called children. Thet grow up in tiny flats which were build in big towns. They hardly saw some domestic animal. They do not even know how does the woodland smell. The science helped them to create their only chance to see the world through TV. As you know, TV is not a good friend. It forces you to accept its pictures, artificial sounds etc. I do not mean that everything what is on TV is bad. I have to tell I like to watch interesting programmes too, but there exists a big disadvantage especially for children. It is loosing the imagination. For example you listen to the music and you want to imagine the princess. But it cannot be your own princess because your own imagination is pushed back by pictures you saw on TV. You are so much influenced by TV that you are not able to make your own "" picture "". Beside the imagination we all need dreaming. I mean healthy dreaming because one should not lost his identity. People who does not dream are as we say "" dry "" and people who dream too much are idealists. But, the science gave us very useful means for dreaming and imagination. Almost every third or fourth man can tell you that if works. And not only with the imagination or dreaming but also with destroying the personality. Yes, I mean drogs. I would like to say that the place for dreaming and imagination is in danger. We can see the affects if our modern society on our children and it is not always because the science, technology and industralisation but also because the family. The family where the only cultural event is the program on TV is not the one where the children know what does the word imagination mean. What should we do with it ?

Yes, that is true. I can say, that I surely agree with this idea. Shell I throw away one year of my life ? Shell I run the risk of being killed ? Or being hurt ? My parents could recieve the message:  We are very sorry, it was an accident.  Thank you very much. I'm not interested. Really, I'm not. Or shell I forget most of that, what I've learned at schools ? No, I've been studying guite a long time to be one year without any possibilities to practise and increase my knowledges. No, I don't want to do it. It is my life and I wont to make decisions about what will I do and what I will not do! And that's not possible in a system of military service. And I think, that a lot of young men are in this situation too. For a lot of people the military service can be a real waist of time. But on the other hand. What can I get or learn during the military service ? I don't know too much about it. I only know from some of my friends, that they started to smoke, learned how to be intolerant, cruel and egoistic. I agree, that it can be usefull sometimes, but I don't want this to be my way of life. Let's talk about another problem. Is it really possible to prepare a good and usefull soldier in a one year course ? I don't think so. This is a great problem. A young man comes to a military service and everything is new for him. He is under the constant psychological pressure and he is going to have a weapon. That is a big danger. If somebody want to have a weapon for his safety he must have a licence. To get the licence means to undergo a lot of tests, answer a lot of questions and be able to shoot well. And this is a big difference. A young man gets a weapon after one month preparation and goes to take care of some place. Alone. And we practically don't know anything about him. But he has a loaded weapon. And how to solve this problem ? I mean that the only solution is the army consisting of the professional soldiers. A soldier should be a normal job like every other jobs are. It means with its own system of education of soldiers as a professionalists. These soldiers would be better prepared and educated. And I thing, that this is the aim of this idea. More prepared and educated army, made from people who want to be there, are paid for it and know that it is their job, that all means a better army. And all other people can use all their knowledges and energy for their work and save one year of their life. It is ",0.0

Some people say that in our modern world, dominated by science technology and industrialisation, there is no longer a place for dreaming and imagination. What is your opinion ? This is really a frightening statement. I would like to meet  those people  and ask them what exactly they mean by saying such a thing. There would be no longer a place for a human race if people are not able to dream and imagine. I think dreaming and imagination are two of the most important things that help people to survive in  our modern world . It is part of your soul, heart. . life. Why and how would people stop dreaming ? You can not forbid yourself to dream because it just happens. We have sweet dreams as well as nightmares and they talk to us, talk about us, our feelings, emotions and thoughts from the very depth of subconsciousness. Sometimes it is like living a double life. Going through situations that never happened to you before and might never happen again. You can learn from your dreams too. One never knows what is the dream going to be like. A big surprise. Dreamless life without surprises ? And what about our own dreams, ideal ideas, special private secrets, goals that we all dream of ? Can  those people  point at a single person without a dream ? I will bet there is none. Dreams are about imagination, life is imagination. Just count how many times a day you only use this word ( I can not imagine, imagine. . ) and I am not even trying to count how many times people do imagine something. Imagination is a non - verbal communication and a creative way of thinking. My future profession should be teaching art and drama. I would like to teach children painting, drawing, graphic etc. by means of imagination. The whole childhood is based on dreams and imagination. What it will be like to live without being a child first, without playing games, listening to fairy tales, creating your own worlds with good and bad characters, pictures. .. ? All of us should keep inside something from a child he or she used to be. We should try to see and perceive the world and nature from the right point of view. Everybody has to decide for himself where to stand. It has a lot in common with science, technology, industry etc., all this is a part of development. Development is not unfortunately equal with improvement. Life without dreaming and imagination could be suitable for progressive machines and computers. They do not feel, think, live! Sometimes I am worried what it will be like on earth in 10, 20, 30, 100 years ? What kind of people will survive ? Or are there going to be some people left ? May be  those people . A strange thing happened to me recently. I asked a Dutch friend of mine to help me with cracking the walnuts. What a surprise, he has never seen a walnut in a shell so he did not know how to do it !! In that moment I felt happy that I live in a country which was out of progress in comparison with western countries. I do not want my children to know walnuts only from the supermarket. Or is this development towards the modern world ? A. Einstein said:  Imagination is more important than knowledge.  What is your opinion ?

In our modern world dominatewd by science, technology and industrialization there is no longer a place for dreaming and imagination. A statement that in our modern world dominated by science, technology and industrialization there is no longer a place for dreaming and imagination is in general true. I would also add that there is not an enough place for musing. To stop and think, to read and write, to listen, to relax may sound to many of us as a luxury. We all seem to be running through our lives. When we were children time went by seemingly slowly but then at some point it speeded up and since then we have been carried away by a fastflowing stream that will be stopped only by the death. What kind of force is it that is pushing us forward ? Is it a fear of a disconnection from the crowd or si it a fear of loosing, or is it just our greed ? May be all of those. I come from a big city and I do everything at speed. I walk fast, talk fast, eat fast, I am even writing this essay in a hurry. I am 22 years old and I already feel tired of such a hasty life. I do not see any point in rushing all the time and yet, I rush. Only to think of a stress and a time one wastes in an overcrowded public transportation everyday in order to get where he / she needs. Sometimes we all wish we could live somewhere else where a life would be more peaceful and relaxed. We seek quiet spots where we can rest at least for a while. However, I never escape the pressure of time I feel. Where are the roots of the hasty world we live in ? It is believed that they originated in the industrial revolution of the eighteenth century that brought crucial changes. The changes according to the Webster's dictionarz were following :  Technological and social, they had their roots in the developement of new machines and sources of power. Machinery replaced hand tools, and water, steam or electric power replaced the muscle of man and beast . The definition suggests that things became easier and quicker to be made, distances were shortened and a new age with its new way of life was born. Since than the technical and industrial developement has progressed many times over and with it the pace of life. When Aldous Huxley wrote his Brave New World he meant it as a science fiction and did not expect some of it to come true in only fifty years if ever. When he wrote it he may have thought of next centuries, of a distant future and yet, while reading the novel now we may find things in it somehow familiar to us from our world, we experience them in everyday life. The wheel of the progress seems to go really fast. We no longer are able to follow all thhe inventions that have been accomplished by a man. We tried top keep up with the progress hard and what is happening is that we are run down people who do everything a s fast as possible and faster and who complain about stress and suffer from headaches and neuroses. However, our modern civilization doesn't cover the whole planet. Still ther exist some nations that live in their own fashion. They don' t follow any of our rules and obey their own loss that are closely tied with the nature. We look at them as at savages and tend to pity them. We also feel responsible to help them enter the modern world. We cannot understand their way of living because it is too simple for us. We do not believe in the simplicity of life. We need cars, TV and other technical marvels to feel as humans. I doubt we are happier though than the people who do not know what computers are. It is known that the natural nations are more relaxed and live in a relative harmony wehile the majority of our population is tensed and unbalanced. I do not believe that we should go back, get rid of all the things that are part of our modern world, and we are part of them, in order to make life simplier and more natural but we need to become reasonable and careful about what we are doing. Also we need to stop being arrogant and think that our civilization is the only good, or even the best existing society on this planet.

Some people say that in our modern world, dominated by science technology and industrialisation, there is no longer a place for dreaming and imagination. I admit that this world is too much dominated by science technology but on other side if you look around you can see a lot of glimpses of new ideas and all kinds of imagination. Where science technology ends, imagination starts. People are fed up of artificial world. They are looking for their own paradise of dreams where they could close a door to science and be there alone just with a "" human factor. "" Listening to music and imagining a story that could have happened. Looking at a picture and have their own feeling about expression. Reading a book and see a town, a countryside, people living there, ..... But the way they imagine them while reading a story and not the way a state manager can see it and shows it from his point of view. But look at this differently. Could you listen to music without a good radio, tape recorder or compact disc player ? We need science for our live. But we have to be picky. We should know what is useful for us and what is just killing our imagination and our time. I think you already know what I am pointing at. Television, of course. As far as I am concerned the biggest harm for people's imagination are films, movies. I prefer a poetic or an artistic films where not everything is said and a spectator is made to think. But these sort of films are only an exception on our TV. People are watching everything and they have already forgotten how to amuse themselves differently. So as soon as they come home they switch on TV set and spend several hours watching stupid films full of violence. They are not communicating within a family as long as it is not about food. They are watching TV whole evening even if they are bored. "" Good night "" is the only words they say to each other .There is not a place left for their own thinking. Parents, who are tired after whole day and are not willing to play with their children in the evening, are glad that the television can help them to entertain their kids while they are having a rest. But children need to speak with their parents, communicate with them. They like watching TV as well but later they do not know how to express themselves. They do not know what to do with their free time. May be they lost their imagination but I am sure they still have a dream that their parents start to talk to them. But not only about school and problems with their teachers but about their feelings, about their lives. I just read an article about living without television. People who do not have TV were describing the way they lived before and how they live now. They were tired of violence and passive watching all sort of films. They used to sit in front of TV whole evening expecting that the next program would be better. But, of course, it was even more silly than previous one. They admit that TV is the quickest way how to be informed but they prefer newspaper where you can choose an article according to its headline. On TV you have to watch every news even if you are not interested in it. And what more after watching news they got so upset that they could not sleep well. The world around us is so brutal that we should protect ourselves from another evil and another bad news. So all these things motivated them to get rid of TV. Now they feel more satisfied than before. They are not wasting their time watching TV any more. They have enough time to talk to each other, they are reading listening to music, playing music, playing the cards, singing all together and doing their hobbies. They do not need TV to their lives any more. On other side they are saying that this is possible only with a bit older children. If they are only about ten years old, they need to know yesterday's program that they can talk about it with their peers. Other wise their is nothing else to talk about and they would be lost. They would not find a friend at school to share their own experience. So as you can see there are two points of view of living with science. My private conclusion is : Science is necessary and very useful for our live, only thing is to know how to use it. We need to be strong enough and fight with science and also with our laziness.

CZPR3009,3.5,,,,,,Feminists have done more harm to the cause of women than good,"
A definition of feminism stated in dictionaries is usually very simple and sounds very innocent: the principle that women should have the same rights and chances as men. This principle must be definitely considered as justified and rightful. Nevertheless not many people (especially not men) imagine exactly the above termed principle under the word ""feminism"". The bulk of the worldwide population would defined it rather as ""some sort of furious activities practised by over-ambitious females"". They imagine angry, rattled women marching through the streets, yelling ""We do hate men!"" the question is if such an opinion can be or should be contradicted and accused as wrong misleading or simplified.
All the main slogans proclaimed by feminism, i.e. radical feminism, because only this branch of the movement expresses itself aloud enough, those main slogans advise women not to get ""enslaved"" by marriage"", not to become ""factories for producing children"", not to let men use them as toys to play with... Such ideas might be not only unpleasant for both men and reasonable women but they might be also extramely dangerous for the growing up generation.
Girls are as intelligent as boys but we cannot ignore the fact that the two sexes have different inborn qualities. It is a fact! Boys are rather rational, girls more emotional, boys are usually more ambitious or wilder than girls, who are very often placid and modest as far as their career is concerned. Everybody would agree that both girls and boys - or men and women, if you want - should have the same right and opportunity in employment and education but at the same time even the radical feminists must see that there is a certain number of girls who will be perfectly satisfied as housewives or taking only part-time jobs which will leave them enough time to look after their families, their husbands and children. And thereis no reason to blame the girls for following this traditional female role-model, no reason to call them ""slaves"" and to prevent them from their choice. Of course, not all young women will be satisfied with this social role. Despite of that they will be able to divide their interests between their professional and family life in most cases without any problem. There is something unnatural in the feminists'vision of a ""househusband"" or a highly career orientated woman.
Feminists advise not to have children. Why? Don't the feminists see what power it is hidden in the ability of giving birth to a child? Females are not ""factories for producing children"", their bodies are ingenious, strong as also many male gynecologists state, they are able of something very special and inimitable. Why should women get rid of such an honourable status?
Are women just men's toys? Another nonsense. Every real man, even the toughest one, becomes soft as wax when dealing with a charming, i.e. real woman. Men would never admit it and feminists don't want to see it but it is a lady who governs her cavalier'life. And her power is in concealing the fact and being aware of this fact at the same time.
Feminists and their generally known activities seem not to fight women's discrimination to win equality for women against men, more likely they strive to be like men. Women should stay women. The original idea of feminism is undoubtedly right but the reality is very different. If real women don't stop feminists from their interfering in time we could have to face a very weird war soon - women versus men!

CZPR3010,2.5,2.0,,,,,"Some people say that in our modern world, dominated by science and technology and industrialisation, there is no longer a place for dreaming and imagination. What is your opinion?","
When I tryed to choose any topic for my essay I found the last one as most. The title is ""Some people say that in our modern world, dominated by science technology and industrialisation, there is no longer a place for dreaming and imagination. What is your opinion?""
At the first sight, or better, at the first reception, it sounds right but did you ever try to think about it a bit deeper ? The problem is that we know how important is dreaming for us. I do not mean any imagination of fifteen years old boys, e.g. how great it could be to stay alone at any islands, maybe just with my favourite singer ( I know that it could be strange but I know several of them), or something really similar. The science technology has been mentioned above. And what about the machines that are more and more important nowadays ? I think imagination was the first impulse for it. You dream about something, then you try to design it and when everything goes well, it could happen that one day you could be celebrated because of your invention.
And another one, more or less, scientific sight of this problem. As you probably know imagination is a part of our consciousness. Sometimes we are able to solve problems by means of our imagination. But when we wanted to solve it by our brain, we wouldnt have been succesfull. So we just dream about the solving them.
To tell truth I am not sure if the question is set exactly right. We could devide dreams. Looking into the dictionary I found there several interpretations for the word ""dream"". ""Dream is a group of related thoughts, images, or feelings experienced during sleep."" This is one possible way how to look at it and I am not sure it is the topic you wanted to speak about. But on the other hand dreams helps us to make our minds clear. There is a quantity of pictures from our life that are going through our mind when we are sleeping. And our mind, or brain, if you want, is able to select them and preserve only these that are important for us.
The second explanation is that one about daydream - it is a state of mind in which one does not pay much attention to the real world. From this point of view is the title, in fact, true.( If we will not include people that are in any case handycapped by this because they are not able to see what is truth and what are just their dreams). To find any time just for yourself, to go for a walk, to have a chat with friends or only think about your holidays, contingently about your previous or future love. If somebody would like to be succesfull he or she has practically no time for things like this.His work is at the first place. But it is up to them to decide what they prefer because the world and life without dream is really poor.
From my point of view I sometimes really prefer to live in a world of dreams because it helps me not to become crazy. You know there are so many things that you are not able to understand at all and it is great when you can just close your eyes and start to dream about something pleasant for you and, for example, forget that there are also bad people around the world.

I am looking back to the history of mankind. People have always had a worship which influenced their lives. These worships were different.
It should have been nature, king, religion ... nowadays it is television.
Television offers three basic things are important for modern man: information, entertainment. These things we can get very easily, in very comfortable way. We just only sit in room and press buttom. In a few minutes we get all information about the war in Jugoslavia, how is the President of Lapland and what will the weather be like. In other few minutes we can learn Spanish with charming Spanish teacher and if we are not tired young couple invite us for dancing course. All these things we are able to get through within few hours without moving from our house.
Television has become a part of our lives. If you do not watch television you are lost. Television is one of the most frequent themes of everyday communication. When you do not know what to talk about with your friend ask him what was on television yesterday evening. In the past people were talking about Sunday s preachings. They critisized preacher and speculated what the next preaching would be about. Nowadays we critisize a new serial we have seen on Sunday and guess if the main herol fall in love with his new neighbour or not.
Not only adults watch television there is broadcast for children too.Children watch television more and more often.Some children do not go to school because there goes some interesting film on. Children are loosing contact with real life.They know the life from television. Due to television children have no imagination, no fantasy and no vocabulary. They can name film stars, sportsmen, singers but they do not know Julius Werne, Karl May or H.Ch.Andersen. Children do not read books they prefere watching television it is more comfortable. When you ask ten-year-old child to explain something at school he is not able to do it. His vocabulary is poor.
Television is a killer of time. Whenever I switchon television I never manage to do things I was going to. Television is dangerous in this way. We can become dependent on it. We become television fanatics.Television is a sorte of church. What was said on television is true. When you do not know what was said in ""church"" you are not a member of our society. You are not ""religious"".
Due to television we have nearly forgotten about theatre, cinema...Try to ask somebody how often dols he go to the theatre. Once a year probably. When I go to the cinema I am afraid if there is enough people,, if it is worse to start the performance for ten visitors. And what about exhibitions. There is more exhibitions then its visitors. It is sad. Culture is falling down. Instead of pure culture there is pseudoculture called television.
I have read nice quatation: ""I love sport. I can watch it for hours"".This sentence describes nowadays situation. Many people like sport but instead of going out and playing fotball they prefere to watch it on television. It is not so dangerous and it is comfortable.
I wonder what happen when all people decide to watch sport on television and there will be no sportsmen. Will sport disaplar from our life ?
Television symbolized our time. Comfortable life passing through very quickly. Life full of information. Television is a worship we need. People had religion influencing their lives. They believed in God. The faith helped them to survive. We have television which influences our lives. Next generations will different worship. There always must be something to believe in.

CZPR3013,3.5,3.0,,,,,"In the words of the old song: ""Money is the root of all evil""","
Money is an important part of our life. Human beeing stands on the existence of money. Everyone needs money to satisfy his own necessity. Money produces evil among all people in spite of proverb: ""All is not gold that glitters."" Same people have the only aim - to get money no matter how.
Money determines social position in society. High class is represented mostly by businessmen or employees of American firms. American firms offer to their employees high wages but they must submit everything to their job. Their families and children have nearly everything they want but they lose their fathers and their family life is missing. At that time children are influenced by their friends very much. So there is a dangerous of gambling, alcohol, drugs etc.
Gambling is important problem among young people. Gamblers need a lot of money to play games. They are dependent on the games in a while. They spend all their money and still need them. They are able to do everything to gain money for the games. Children often steal money at home. Dependance on gambling is something like dependance on drugs so gamblers are also treated in medical institutions.
Crime is connected mostly with money. Thefts, robberies, murders are realized especially because of money. ""Appetite comes with eating"" so crime is spread more and more because some people wants still more and more money. They are able to risk possibility to get in prison but their yearn for money is stronger. For example gangs, which are interested in stealing cars, have been increasing. We can ask why? The answer is that they have a large sum of money from this. It is unbelievable that someone can exchange a part of his life in prison for money. Even if they do not hesitate to use violence or murder anyone only for money.
Everyone is used to live in his living standart. Importance of having money we feel especially when we have not them enought. In this case we started to think up how money gets. People imagine that money can fulfill all their dreams. Actually it is truee but not at all. When you have a large amount of money you can buy everything, but you can not buy true friends, health, love of your wife, your husband or your children. By public opinion research in Czech republic, where people were asked to their value of life, we have known interesting things. In these years people`s opinions have been changed. Importance of possessive has increased and overtook importance of education and hobbies. Result from this research is unpleasant not only for me. The people are not interested in education or hobbies but mostly in money. It never mind what a man does but the main thing is how much money he earns.
All people need money, it is natural. But important is how much they are able to sacrifice for money. Children suffer from their parents` work because they are all time in their job. Children having enough money can start with gambling. Then they need money more and more so they are able to commit a crime. People`s oppinions have been changed in consequence of reaching money. Somebody has the only value which is money. Where a lot of money is, evil exists. Money and evil were and will exist. We must try to put it down.

Some people say that in our moderm world, dominated by science technology and industrialization, there is no longer a place for dreaming and imagination. What is your opinion ?
I was born and I still live in the town of Pardubice. I have been studying at Charles University in Prague for three years. That means long journeys, although I partly live in Prague, between these my favourite cities. I have to spend a lot of time in trains and I try to amuse myself by various activities like reading books, learning or listening to music. Most of all I love dreaming, just dreaming and thinking about realizable and unrealizable wishes.
Some people say that in our modern world dominated by science technology and industrialization, there is no longer a place for dreaming and imagination. To tell the truth I would like to meet some of those people and discuss their hasty and thoughtless statement. It is very strict opinion those people did not exactly think about. It sounds like an answer of small-minded people who do not particularly beat their brains with answers requiring a bit of thinking and conceding other ideas. The more people say that our modern world is full of science technology and industrialization the more it is full of hastiness, stress, nervous tensions and breakdowns and the more they need to create their own dreamland, just for dreaming and imagination. Each of us should have this wonderland, which can be shared by more people, as a occasion for escaping from the real life activity, overwork and nervousness.
Those people can claim that we need to keep clear of fantasy and imagination in our modern world and that escaping from the real life only disturbs us. This opinion is beyond me and it beats me. Yes, it is true, it disturbes us, but in what way? We can forget about our problems and tiredness for a while. For those people escaping from the real life represents television, opium of the masses. I have no say in it and I love watching television as well. But millions of people all over the world love watching American television programmes, those neverending programmes well known in many countries. They are very popular, but they are not like real life at all. Women want to look as young and beautifully or as old and beautifully as those clever or stupid, good-looking and never fat stars. They want to drive the same fast cars, to live in the same wonderful and large houses, to buy the same expensive clothes. They love thinking about that and it is a kind of dreaming, even for some people very unsatisfactory. Those programmes are called real life stories, but how real are they?
This problem is summed up in a single word - television. I do not want to explain the influence of watching television, but I feel it my duty to talk little bit about it, because it concerns dreaming and imagination as well. Television destroys especially children's dreams and ideas. They develop their creativity and inspiration throughout plays and reading books aloud by their parents. This particular activity is very important for improving their fantasy. It is the easiest thing to put a child in his place in front of the television set and not to take care of him anymore. Watching television makes the children lazy to think about the main idea, about character of the main heroes and about the landscape the plot takes place in. There is no resourcefulness. They should be incited to creating their own wonderland, they must have this fairyland in which all wonderful events will be taken place.
It does not matter about what you are dreaming, if your dreams are realizable and can come true or not. You can dream about love, work or aims of your life, about your meeting wishes. Some people likes fantasizing about happyending their existing problems, some of them think about fictitious stories. have discussed quiet different features of our modern life - living in the world of science technology and industrialization and dreaming. Hardly anyone is able to join these features together. But I know some extraordinary people that are able to solve difficult tasks while dreaming. Happy people.
Try to think and dream creatively as they do.

CZPR3023,3.5,,,,,,"In the words of the old song: ""Money is the root of all evil""","
What role does money play in human life? We can hear in words of one old song:"" Money is the root of all evil"". On the other hand a lot of people are persuaded that money assures happiness. I think it is not possible to characterize money in general. There are many points of view from which money can be looked on. I found three of them the most important : money as an essential part of life, money as a means how to make life happier and easier and money as temptation to the sin.
Money as a condition of human existence in today society has also the great influence on human freedom. The word  freedom"" has different meaning than it had in the history. Man is free if he is not dependent on anybody. To be independent means to have enough money to be able to live. To live independently means to do whatever one wants to do and what is not against the law. Money assures that. If you have money you can buy whatever you want, you can travel wherever you want, you can realize your plans. To be financially independent means not to be afraid of what you will have for dinner tomorrow. The feeling of material security is the necessary condition for effective human activity. Everybody is aware of the value of money and does his best to have it enough. The quotation He who says money has no sense for human life does not mean his money but money of the others"" perfectly expresses human mentality. Money decides what place you take in the society. Money motivates people to work hard to have higher income.
Money has the power to make human life easier and more pleasant. It can even change life into paradise. This all depends on who treats the money. If people treat money in common sense it can help them to realize their dreams and to reach happiness. Everybody has different ideas on what happiness is. It can be a new car, travelling or a lot of pets. For somebody to feel happy means to help the others who need money more than the owner. By the human acts of donating money to the poor and sick people many human lives were saved.
Finally, negative human qualities can change money into the disaster. Money is the leading power of the world. People do anything to have money. Even though they can fairly work in classical way they prefer to earn money in various simplier ways - they steal, hazard with their and others life even kill each other. Blind with the vision of wealth and better future they can not see the results of their acts - baffled fates of innocent people, baffled fates of themselves. Money works as a drug. If such a people feel how sweet it is to have money they want to have it all the time and they do everything for it. They steal and kill again and again. These people do not live normal life. They are victims of money. Not money is the root of all evil. The root of all evil is bad man with his negative qualities. Money serves as a means how to realise the evil. Money causes many disasters in family life. Because of money a perfect family can change into the pack of wolfs. Family tragedies are often caused by the question of inheritance. Children kill their parents, younger brother kills the older one, wife kills her husband. This all prove how strong position money has in human life. It has so big power that it can break the relations between the closest friends. Because of money the wars start. Because of money people do not live naturally. To gain money one has to learn to dissimilate, to trick, to lie. The lack of money causes human suffering even death. The example of this evil expresses the situation in the developing countries. Thousands of people die during one day because of famine which is caused by the poorness of the country.
Through ages mankind is characterized by the human qualities which were given to it by God. Positive qualities make the good and negative ones make the evil. Both together make the reality of life. This world has no chance to get rid of any of them. They are like energy - still constant only changing the forms. As I have mentioned money can not be characterized in general. The money in the hands of a wicked man causes the evil. An intelligent man, who knows what the real human values are, spends money in the positive way. So, money can not be characterized as a good or bad thing. It is just means by which we realize our life and fate.

CZPR3027,3.0,3.0,,,,,"In the words of the old song: ""Money is the root of all evil""","
In the l9 th century in our modern world full of technology and industrial process is no place for  normal people"". Why? Because of many reasons. One of them is money. Money is in the first place a big dream of many people. It is also currency which nobody can live without and it is also effective mean how to show your social power. Everybody have a particular dream or wish to become rich.
Would not it be wonderful to have a beautiful house with servants and with the swimmingpool, two cars in large garage, own helicopter, beautiful wife or husband - of course, vacation everywhere you want, permission to enter places you would have never visited before. If I would have learned millions I would have built a big stable with lot of horses everywhere. It should have been placed somewhere in the countryside, surrounding should be beautiful as well as woods, meadows and lakes all around. I know that my dream is rather idealistic. But I think that everybody should have his own dream. Sometimes it helps people a lot. You have to get rid of all the rush sometimes. This may be a dream from the point of view of common man. But did you ever think that there are also people from so called  third world"" whose dreams can be completely different ? Have you ever thought of such things as: hunger, cold, incurable diseases and many other things which human being needs. Such people do not need much. They would be satisfied with just basic things to survive. Hunger is horrible thing. Thousands of people are surviving from day to day. We cannot imagine it because we had not ever went through such thing. Those people are grateful for everything.
It must be horrible feeling not to be able to feed your children, having no place to live in. These people have almost no money. And what is the worst thing? They just do not have the opportunity to earn money. The land there is dry, desserts almost everywhere, lack of water, lot of such people had to escape from the place they lived in because of racizm. A lot of them are killed. Even children are not saved. We have to ask ourselves how is it possible? Who is responsible for all these things? How could these things happen in our high developed society? Why are some countries extremely rich and some of them are extremely poor?
And what about crime? I can see close connection between crime and money. There are lot of people killed of this reason. Many times we could see such cases in which was man killed for some very small sum of money. Another horrible way how to obtain money is distribution of drugs even among children. From the beginning the drug is given to youngsters for free and than when they become to be addicted to drug - taking the people who gave them the drugs for free they start to sell the drugs. Addicted person has no chance and has to buy the drug. As we all know drugs are quite expensive. Teenagers have small chance to earn money. And for this reason they begin to do illegal things. They begin to steal, rape, earn money in illegal way they begin to tell lies, their personalities start to change.
Here is another example of evil caused by money which has happened to me. It was a long time ago when my lovely dog got lost. One day I went to walk my dog called Ben. We walked in the park not faraway of our house. It was beautiful sunny day. Suddenly somebody putted his hand on my shoulder. I turned around. The person asked me the way to the closest post office. I have explained id and the person dissappeared in a minute without saying thank you or good bye."" Strange people"", I said and called back my dog. But Ben did not returned. I have started to ask people sitting in the park about my little, fussy, white dog. Nobody could help me. The dog was lost. I was desperate. The other day I putted signs - dog wanted - on the walls of buildings and telephone boxes. But nobody answered. Than something came to my mind. And what about an award? I putted new signs on the same places as I did before. Another day was my do again with me. With only one difference. I had to pay 2OOO Crowns to the same person who asked me the way to the post office. Why? Because he was lucky finder of my dog.
It is like conjured circle from which is no way out. Sure, money is the root of all the evil because it causes killing of people, it is a great mean of power, it divides people into different social classes. But on the other hand money is need and as I have said before life without it is very cruel.

CZPR3048,3.0,3.5,,,,,The prison system is outdated. No civilized society should punish its criminals: it should rehabilitate them,"
I remember Karel apek`s thought that every crime is understandable if it is well explained from point of view of the offender. I really agree and feel that every human beeing and his or her acting is justifiable and one should be more sorry about him than angry but I do not agree that such a person should not be punished. There are some rules in the nature and in the society as well and they secure that the system will function.
"" Civilised society"" here probably means that it is liberal to individuals ,respects one`s opinions, wishes and tolerates one`s faults. Why not.The qestion is what is the benefit ? One hand with good name and humanity and parasites on the other hand.Ithink that the problem is not a person but the way of acting. We do not want people,it means us, to behave this way.
The punishments are selfeducation and selfdefance of the people in the society against themselves in fact. It should not be revenge in no case. I think that this attitude is good enough to be called civilised.
In decission to punish someone there is the problem of right to do it, responsibillity and correctness.I am afraid that no reliable model how to act exists. The individual and the social view is in conflict here. Who has the right to punish some other person ? Parents, teachers, chiefs and courts in practice. In fact they gave the right to themselves ;of course according to law and habits, which are the legitimiers then. From the view of an individual this situation is rather unpleasant because he or she has to submit to given rules.It may be even very unpleasant but I think it is necessary .If somebody is not able to respect the others, his or her behaving should not be tolerated. This could be justification for punishing someone. I think that the question is not the right but the reason and the way of punishing.
There are various kinds of crimes and criminals. The aim of punishment should be to get the criminal to a harmless position. I believe that there are also some other ways than to kill, inprison or penalize the person. Tere are various reasons and motives for commiting a crime. According to this, individual cases must be considered. I think that people, who are sorry about their acting and are not going to repeat their deed, do not need any extra punishment. Their conscience mostly causes enough suffering to them. These people often need to encourage for next life than the opposite. Worse problem is when the offender does not feel gilty -does not reason own acting or this egoist just does not mind the harm caused to the others. Now way of treating the person must be different.This should be sold on the field of psychology. This istrue that prison is not the best way. It is not very helpful in many cases but certain restriction of ones freedom is often necessary.
It would be nice if everybody could be reeducated and incorporeted into the society but how to do it ? I suggest to start with educating children. I would never keep them in "" home prison"" but punish them pragmaticly, for their good.

Abstract thinking, imagination and dreams included, strongly distinguish man from other living creatures. Abstract thinking and fantasy already existed in Stone Age and it could be fantasy that helped man to use his the strongest power - the brain. This power helped him to develope thinking and replace claws and hunting knives, arms of other animals, by the brain. Thinking and fantasy are unrivalled and unique phenomena. Ideas are what have made man create new and new things. He tries to realize his ideas in a way to make man`s life easier. But man realize even such things that are absolutely irrelevant for his common life. He puts ideas ito effect just to delight himself, to express his mood - other solely human phenomena. Impulse to note down his notions, dreams or feeling certainly has got each of us. A profession, education, colour, religion, historical time, a place on the Earth, a personal situation, suffering, a joy, none of these will destroy human thirst for self-implementation let alone dreaming and imagination. Dreams and ideas belong to man as naturaly as tears, pain or death. Nome of us knowsa lot about dreams and ideas and to write about them or to understand them is as foolish as to talk about many other inexplicable and timeless things. Man will never lose his fantasy. After all he safe his ideas even in the worst moments when he fights for his life. But it seems he will never use it sufficiently. Thanks to many inventions and science technology of 20th century man can put his ideas into effect more easily then in the past. And a possibility to compare how and what ideas, feelings and dreams people noted down in the old days gives people of these days a huge possibility of large combination. Each of us fights imagination every day. It is an everyday escape from reality.
The possibility of realization our ideas is bigger nowadays then it wasfew centuries ago. Material scientific progress makes possible such things which would seem to be just a dream in the past.Everybody can takes pictures thanks to cameras or video cameras and thus throw himself into the realization of his own ideas. Thousands of people can play musicalinstruments or paint pictures in various ways. And I did not mention computers or virtual reality. This all was not possible in the past and thanks to these gadgets and thanks to relatively more leisure time each of us becomes an architect of our ideas. And each of such attempts to realize an idea arouses another another one and thus theirs number increase.
We meet individual realization of ideas every day. Fashion is one of the most common. The choice of clothes offers man to use his fantasy. THe choice of furniture in a flat, clours, jewelary and other accessories, shapes of things, all these make man possible to realize immense imagination. Ideas are even shown at things of the hightest technology like cars or hi-fi towers. Our modern world, dominated by science technology and industrialisation, brought us the stress and hurry. Life is still a fight to the death but under different conditions.New style of life is formed. New forms of ideas necessarily lead to new forms of their exprresion. Television and cinema - that is the world of dream. And man run away there every day. Music with its incretible variability took control of world. Sgrafity can be another escape from the stress of modern life, noise, smog and technology. Imagination will always survive. Even homeless people, the natives in jungles or the biggest man of science live with an imagination. Man would love to live in a dream. Otherwise he would not spend a large amount of money on adventure holidays, hunderts of CD-discs or videotapes or drugs. Books, pictures, statues - everything is just a trip to the world of imagination. Sex is next escape to a dream. Dreams, imagination and ideas are the system of self-defence. A rubbish heap where man puts troubles and drowns his problems.
20th century has brought other possibilities that people from the old days did not know. THe possibility of comparison how people noted down their ideas from prehistorical time utill the end of the second milennium brings incredible number of combination. This comparison and combination helps to create new and new works.
A dream has been a good refuge where everybody has access and where everybody can find what is longing for and what is loking for. Everybody endulges in dreams and ideas. If more or less today, nobody can aprove. In any case dreams and ideas are part of human nature and it will never come to an end.

Basicly i do not agree with the people who say that in the modern world there is no place for imagination because of developing technology. It is a nonsense - man uses his own imagination to invent new things and make the situation more convenient for himself. The bad circumstances which goes hand in hand with the modernization process is actually other topic.But it is true that the progress should be considered more from the different sides in general, not only for near future and particular places. Also the most convenient technological proposal should be chosen everytime.
It is true that time goes more and more quickly thanks to the developing transport,the information or signal system...Actually that might be the right impuls for people to develop their own worlds - in their minds and so escape from the fuss around themselves.
People do not realize the real world looks exactly the same how they imagine it or think about. If they are optimists also the world looks pleasant and the way of living is easier for them.But it does not matter wheather one is optimist or pesimist but the most important thing is if one has one's own ideas and opinions - so if one's world is strong enough.
A lot of people feel desperate just because they can not get rid of their problems but without any try of solving them first. It is lack of thinking and analysing which exists among people. They are not able to identify the problem easily, they do not name it so that is why they cannot solve it. Instead of discussing the hard situation they push it away on the pile of other unsolved problems. A lot of people wouldsay there is no time for ""stopping"" and trying to think about their way of life. Most of them even would not admit they can do something like that or it does not come to their minds. But the real human being is distinguished from the other creatures just by the ability of thinking and dreaming. Everybody should create own world for himself - some refuge or a shelter - and use his own imagination in a positive way. That person would be strong enough to bear his own world full of new and new ideas. The solution or the instrument or a rich self created world can be found in art. Art stands on the base of dreaming, imagination, and fantasy. It offers a new way of looking at things from the different positions through the ages. Art tries to connect the objective reality with the subjective way of living. As much as we get closer to into it we are opening an insuperable space for us to investigate. New questions appear in front of us so our imagination can not have a rest. Then the whole process of perception seems to be as a whirl which turns more and more quickly,still the new connections come to the surface and repeat. The whirl develops, streams to the peak and we are part of it. It is neverending but deeper everytime by its rotation. As closer we try to get to the top of it we realize how difficult it is to give only one possible answer to our question. It is the struggle but in the same time the coordination of many spheres : of reality, morality, justice, faith, experience, memories, and so on. Everybody is captured by the different one so then we think and use the imagination in the different ways. So I do not think it is true that there is "" no longer place for dreaming and imagination "". When should it be more convenient for a man to use his ability of dreaming more than nowadays ? The imagination offers an escape from the reality which we must more or less accept to be able to survive. Let us try to educate our children to use their ability of imagination, let us support and emphasize their natural sense of curiosity and sensitivity. Let us introduce them art as an essential part of their lives - try to make them think, analyse the situations and match them with the feelings. Then it will not be hard for them to find their own unique way of looking at the world in which they would be completely free - captured "" only "" by themselves; struggling with their own thoughts and their conscience. Afterwards they will not ask the question if there is a place for dreaming and imagination.....

CZPR3057,3.5,,,,,,Most university degrees are theoretical and do not prepare students for the real world. They are therefore of very little value,"
Most university degrees are theoretical and do not prepare students for the real world. They are therefore of very little value.
We can deal with this topic from various points of view. The first point of view could be an analysis of the assumptions contained in the title of the essay The statement contains three questionable assumptions, namely that most university degrees are in fact theoretical that even if they are theoretical they do not prepare students for the real world and they are therefore of very little value. Let us have a look at these 3 points in turn.
- It is of course a big generalization to say that most university degrees are theoretical - that they are only theoretical and have no practical content. Such a statement ignores the vast body of vocational qualifications designed to train people for particular careers mainly in scientific engineering, medical fields. etc. Many such courses include periods of practical experience in industry, hospitals or other appropriate areas. The courses must of course contain theory as well. A doctor must know how the human body works in order to cure his patient. A civil engineer must understand laws of physics before he can design a bridge. Therefore students are given special lectures on appropriate disciplines concerning their fields of study but they also have to spend a certain time in practice where they are supposed to make themselves acquainted with their future profession. For ex. students of Medicine have to spend some time in hospitals where they are thought practical things - they are thought ""how to treat a human body in practice"". They are sent from one ward to another to be able to cure all the human diseases and later they can decide what they will want to deal with. They can choose their specialization.
- I do not know what is student teaching like in other countries but that is true that a period of student teaching is strictly limited in our country.
In my opinion students of the disciplines mentioned above should spend more time dealing with practical things.
- Many university degree courses are not of this kind however. Those concerned with arts subjects and some very theoretical sciences might be at first sight labelled ""theoretical"". Knowledge of medierval history or works of literature might be considered to be of no practical value. However in such courses of study students are essentially doing practical things - reading, researching, analysing, writing etc.
- This brings us cocnveniently to the second statement that such courses do not prepare students for the real world. It is arguable that if students are doing practical things even whilst studying subjects of a more academic nature they are acquiring skills and developing their power of intellect and understanding. These skills can indeed be of value in many walks of life not least business and public service especially when the information technology explosion of the 20 th century bombards us all with increasing data, information, statistics etc. In this case our theoretical degree could be of help for our comprehension of such demanding scientific and business fields. The students who has followed a so-called ""theoretical"" course of study can be well equipped to deal with this.
- This conclusion brings us to the last of the three assumptions, in that ""the theoretical course of study cannot be of any practical value"". The theoretical course of study can indeed be of practical value as it is mentioned above.However to confine ourselves to a definition of ""practical value"" means to condemn ourselves to a utilitarian view of life. Study of arts, history, literature, music etc. adds to the richness beauty and fulfilment of life and must surely provide value. These aspects are as much part of the real world as a routine of day to day living.
- Now let us look at the second point of view. It could be named ""the role of university education in society"". Society should have an understanding for a general role of university education. Such a type of education should be absolutely different from other types of higher education. Universities should help their students in developing their power of logical reasoning. A university graduate should be able to solve various problems but he should especially have a courage to admit that different problems exist in different types of society. He is supposed to be self-contained after his graduation of the last year of university. He is expected to be able to orientate in various kinds of literature and theory.
It is necessary to maintain an independence and sovereignity of universities. It would be regrettable if universities dealt just with disciplines and subjects that are convenient for practical purposes. It is possible to say that cooperation of universities and practical sphere is necessary and inevitable but an independence and sovereignity of universities must be saved at the same time.

Some people say that in our modern world, dominated by science technology and industralization, there is no longer a place for dreaming and imagination. But I do not think so. The mankind civilization could not reach its now-a-days standard without dreaming and imagination. Our dreaming and imagination are being fulfilled every day. So we can fly by planes, sail by liners and submarines, we discovered new lands, we are still finding new worlds in the universe. We have large cities where millions of people live together.
Lets make retrospective outlook on our lives. When we were children, we dreamt about fairies, witches, princes, princesses, dragons and all these creatures from the fairy-tale world. We were imagining how it would be wonderful to be like they were, to live in their world. But time flew and we got older. We started to perceive the real world where no creature from the fairy-tale lived. I started to understand my life as a neverending row of problems. To live means to solve these problems less or more sucessfully.
And when hard moments of our lives come, we dream about easy childhood how careless it was. We try to imagine the world without problems. But it is not like this, so we must keep on trying to create it according to our dreams.
After finishing the school studies we meet problem how to find a good and well paid job. Everybody wants to feel that his work is needful and makes sense. Everybody, I hope, does not like to work just for himself, man wants to earn money to feed his wife and children. This is our dream to have a nice and happy family. We all remember the time when we first fell in love. When the first love came away and we felt so dissapointed the dream that we maybe would find new love and new meaning of life kept us "" alive "".
I also dreamt about man who would be my partner for the rest of my life and who would be father of my children. As a child I wanted a prince, of course. Then I met several men, but my heart was beating as usually. Now I am married it means I found him. I can say I am happy. He is the same like in my dreams. He is clever, gentle, tall man with blue eyes and salt and pepper hair [ even if he is twenty five ]. We started to build our own world. He works in insurance and I hope that I start my teaching in this autumn, finally. We are on the very beginning of our lives we are talking about it every day, but not only about the way we want to live. We are also talking about those little important things such as f. e. the colour of furniture and carpet in our future bedroom, because now we live in a lodging.
We cannot get rid of our dreaming and imagination because it is just inside us and it helps us to live and makes our life more beautiful.

CZPR4005,3.5,2.0,,,,,"In the words of the old song: ""Money is the root of all evil""","
Why is it that we may hear and read so often about thefts, briberies, murders, and many other sorts of corruption ? Why is it that there are pickpockets, burglars, swindlers,spies, murderers, but also beggars, amd the homeless ? The reason why such people exist may be to certain extend individual, but still in most cases these people have one thing in common -that is real or seeming lack of money.
In our modern civilised society money plays a very important role - money seems to be the key to the high standard of living, to the wonderful happy life with no troubles, with many friends, various contacts , which is always connected with social recognition and importance.
In fsct, it enables you to buy everything you want and it means to have everything you want - that is why people want money, and some of them are also able to do anything to get it.
Of course, most of us obey the law, we know that the only possoble way how to gain money is simply to choose a job and begin to work. On the other hand, there are people who were probably not brought up well by their parents who did not lteach them to act honestly, and con-sequently, they make use of any opportunity to get more money - even if they know the way is f.e. illegal . The power of money seems to be very strong and irresistible to them; moreover, they hope that their crime be never detected or prooved. These people follow only their glittering daydream of wealth and power, they do not see the mean way which help them and troubles, sorrow, and misery that they cause to other people. I feel so sorry when I hear f.e. about an old woman killed for a few miserable hundereds or thousands of crowns, it is so sad that ones life has to end for such a little sum of money.
When I think about it sometimes, I find that there is something missing in their lives. Probabely, these people did not find the real values in life, the values that cannot be bought by money, and that are more worth then anything else on earth. Because is there any link between money and the real friendship, love , family bonds, work one loves doing ? Are these things, by all means necessary for happy life, measurable by money ? What would be the price f.e. for about 25 year old friend with black eyes, pleasant smile, interested in sports?
I know that it is always easy to moralize, the reality is, however, more cruel to us, it leads us astray many times, though we may try to do the good. When one is poor he or she lives in constant lack of money and misery, and that is always very tempting to change immediately ones situation by stealing, pickpocketing in the streets, sometimes even killing. Unfortunately, money tempts primarly the poor to things that are usually immoral and wrong. The want of money has a great influence on peoples behaviour, and therefore it has been always worthy of admiration and praise when someone acted honestly under such bad conditions as poverty surely is according to ones better self and ones conviction.
Nevertheless, the problem of commiting a crime is not connected only to the poor. People of various economic and social position may be also tempted by the vision of having more and more money to dishonesty.
On the other hand, money seems to be the only possible means of world trade and market. As for the individuals, they make their living by earning money, and thus they are saved from starving. Money can be used also for creating f.e. new buildings, thetres, galleries, for promoting various cultural or sport activities, for scientific research, for helping to solve ecological problems amd probable disasters, and also for helping those people who are not sel-sufficient for various reasons ( f.e. the disabled, drug addicts,, children without parents and home, and others who are in need of our society support for some time).
It seems, after all, that money is only an intermediary between a person and the thing he or she wants to have or to realize. The thing, then, may be useful either to the persont himself or herself or to others or to the whole mankind. So, I repeat againthat monez is not the so called ' root of all evil ', it is only a device which one should handle well. Because it depands always on the person how wisely or unwisely will use money.
So. I am convinced that money makes no harm in our world, on the other hand, it is people, their characters, and bad habits that cause the evil. We cannot blame money, we should look inside our hearts and souls, and try to follow our better selves and suppress the bad habits we carry inside. A very old saying about fire may be applied on our problem of money ( a little bit changed), it goes : Money is a good servant, but a bad master.'. And especially those people who earns money omly because they want to have more and more money for themselves should think about the wise statement Ive mentioned!!!

CZPR4013,3.5,3.0,,,,,"Some people say that in our modern world, dominated by science and technology and industrialisation, there is no longer a place for dreaming and imagination. What is your opinion?","
Dreaming and imagination are fenomenons natural to human beings . Man, who does not need a special climate but survives in every, who might become a wild creature if he wishes or the intellect itself, who is all the time moulded by surrounding circumstances, needs art that would bring him higher, elate him, that would raise him above the animal kingdom. Dreamiong and imagination is one of the most important source of inspiration to any kind of art. There would be no art without dreaming and imagination, no poetry, no music or literature, no philosophy, no humor, not even science.
I think it is nonsense to say that there is no place or time for dreaming in our modern world. There is and must be time for it. It is impossible to do without imagination and fantasy. There would be no advance in the world, no progress of science and technology without clever imaginative people, who followed their dreams, who were making experiments and discovering useful things.
There is something in the man that pushes him forwards, sets him in motion, forces him to thik. To think about life and how to make it easier and more comfortable. Every new discovery carries the civilisation one step forwards. Man always wanted to get higher, fly, reach the stars and the moon. Jules Verne set his heroes on a journey to the moon one hundred years before the first terrestrial landed on the moon. At the beginning there was a dream. Verne dreamt it, further generations tried to bring this unrealizable dream to life and they succeed. This task cost a lot of energy, pains, effort but also imagimetion and knowledege.
But these days by all that diligence and industry man seems to be forgetting himself, forgetting about his soul, his mental health. People live in a big rush, they work hard all day to make as much money as possible for buying as much products as possible.They buy and consume and watch TV, which is not exacting on imaginaion. They are not aware that this mass-medium makes them dull as it benumbs their mind.
There is no wonder that people want to escape this industrialized overcrowded and fast world full of illnesses. Some people escape to the world of books and art, some escape through religion and faith. Those less lucky ones, who have found neather world of imgination nor God escape to the other side"" by taking drugs. It is only their lazyness and their fear of knowing the cruel truth about themselves and their lost imagination and lost freedom.
We would not be successful even if we consciously tried to restrain every expression of imagination in us. We would still have unconscious dreams during the night, which we can not have under control. People live about sixty years, twenty years of their life they sleep away, five of the years people spend dreaming. Scientists found out thet human beings can have dozens, may be hundreds, of dreams in one night! Each dream does not take more than one or two seconds, at the most, one minute. In the mean time we do not know, how dreams arise. We only know that dreams are tight up with the things we have lived through. There is a close conection between our dreams and the things we want or the things that happened in the past. They reflect our inner life. Usually, maybe we can say always, they are very, very strange. It is because dreams are so short that people , after they have dreamed, can not remember all their dreams. They forget a lot of them when they wake up. The dreams we remember when we are awake are nothing else but mixed up parts and small pieces of different dreams, it is very interesting, yet uncomprehensible.
Living in harmony with the nature, common sense, imagination and dreaming seem to be the only right way to preserve a healthy soul.

CZPU1011,4.0,3.0,,,,,Feminists have done more harm to the cause of women than good,"
Do feminists have done more harm to the cause of women than good ? It is not easy to argue not.Women now complete half or more of the places in law and medical schools. The salary gap between men and women is disappearing fast. Women are gradually doing their way into the top ranks of business and public life.At
home, middle class fathers took cooperating with great enthusiasm. Public intolerance for violent, sexist behavior is widespread.Crimes against women are taken seriously and punished.
So what` s to do next? A lot of.
The most stricking women` s issue of today is the situation of single women and their children. Sixty per cent of them live below the poverty line. They have a big call on our social resources.
These women and children need several kinds of help.First,we have to make divorce to cost more for fathers and to cost less for mothers.Divorce usually lowers everyone`s standard of living, but it hits mothers and children much harder.Fathers should be made to pay.
The current debate about who ought to pay taxes on child support money is a ' red herring'.The real issue is, that about 40 per cent of fathers pay irregularly or not at all. Many methods of enforcing compliance come to mind.Someone has to support the children : better the fathers than the taxpayers. And while we are at it, there is a need for a complete overhaul of the runious adversarial way in which custody and support issues are negotiated.
Second, single women have to be discouraged from having children. Several hundred thousand dollars on TV commercials tellin men, it is wrong to hit woman is being spent. One wishes it would spend the same amount telling young girls it is wrong to get pregnant. Children of never married mothers fare worse than children of divorce, because they stay poorer longer. It is time for feminists to admit that having a child without a husband is usually a recipe for poverty, and to acknowledge that a child`s right for a decent standard of living is more important than a woman`s right to choose how and when to be a mother.Issues of morality, double sexual standards and the responsibilities of men are all interesting, but out of point.The point is to help young women to avoid bad outcomes for themselves and their children.
Third, there is a need for more accountability from the whole array of women`s services - especially shelters and rape crisis centres - to ensure that they are actually helping their clients, instead of fighting destructive civil wars over strange issues of race and class. All money spent on racism training should be immediately diverted to help people in need.The money spent on racism training alone would probably fund another two or three women`s shelters.
Fourth, reward of employers who are trying to create family-friendly workplaces should be encouraged and publicised.Experiments with flextime, telecommuting and family leaves are more important for women than all the sexual-harassment policies have been ever written. A business needn`t be rich to try these things. It must be creative and thoughtful.now the profits are on, family policies are creeping back into the radar screen.
Fifth, do they need more women in positions of power and influance? The more there are, the more certain it is that women`s and family issues will be aired. That is why women still need fund raising to make sure more women are elected to public office.That is why women should keep holding companies accountable for recruiting women into their boards and into senior managment.
A few matters are not on this agenda. They include legislated affirmative action and pay-equity programs, zero-tolerance sexual harassment codes, universal day care, condemnation of new reproductive technologies, fight against pornography and few more. Women`s groups have wasted much time and money on these issues, which are marginal for women`s well-being and are being conected with bad and ideological baggage.
There were days when sensible women and men from all the spectrum of opinion and belief united for real, progressive and thoughtful work for change. Could it happen again ?

CZPU1012,3.0,2.0,,,,,"In the words of the old song: ""Money is the root of all evil""","
Money is the root of all evil. Symbolicaly taken, yes it is.
First we must define what money is and what it means to people It is a sibstitute for property. Money itself doesn t worth anything as well as gold and other precious materials. And property in fact ensures the life. And the desire to survive is the basic and strongest instinct of any being ,including people. In adition to this ,in the animals world the power is based on physical abilities, while in the human world the power depends on finantial possibilities, on the amount of wealth. It is an endless process, a circle in fact. People will do anything for money - it will give them power - power to make other people to do something - for money of course. And we are back again , because people will do anything for money .
People are imprisoned in this circulation of money and there is no way out. People, who try to escape will just dig through into another cell. I mean the area of religion or education.
Their hierarchy of their qualities is shifted some way. It is different in many ways, some would say it is more derveloped, less primitive, but the basic function is the same. I. e. these prisoners also desire to be more powerfol than the rest is.
Human nature is to own things that will make their life easier and more pleasant. Looking at the problem from the historical view we can hardly find the breakpoint - the first use of money and it is even more difficult to date when the people in primitive societies started to diferentiate according to their wealth. the first properties were probably a female partner and a piece of land. these two basic possessions can be observed also in the animals world and they in fact are the basis of all fights.It is not correct to say t they are the root of all evil because it is only natural law. But a few thousand years later there came different properties such as a shelter, a primitive weapon and finaly the most important thing - the fire. Fire is the first sign of civilisation plays an important role in the human society developement. The group who had lost their fire could hardly survive. And the desire to survive is the strongest instinct. Thats why here start the fights and here starts the evil. And because Man is thinking and developing creature he brought the evil to extraordinary perfectness. He invented money that can substitute any thing.
Some would say that you can t buy love which is at least a subject of discussion. The only thing that is absolutely out of the power of money is time. People howewer rich they are, are getting old and they never can buy their youth again. Some would say that getting old, weak, the ilnesses etc. is evil that hasnt been caused by money and the statement wouldnt be true but the process of living and dying is only natural and we cannot consider it evil. Evil is just a product of human mind and activity - the wrong side of his inteligence. There cannot be evil among animals, what seems to be cruel and bad to us is never a product of selfishness, envy and hatred but only natural law of life and love of life as well.
So we can agree. Yes, money is really the root of all evil, it causes all fights and struggles. But on the other hand these are part of human charakteristics and the same power ( i. e. the desire to know, to own and to rule ) that causes all the evil is the engine of all progress and civilisation. And it will go forward whatever we want or do. So it is necessary to build up a system that would minimalise this evil.

I chose the consecutive topic by chance because I am (and I think that most of people is aware of the fact that our world is full of overtechnologized arrangements which make human life very hectic and wearing; but on the other hand, also boring. Frankly, I think these aspects of our nowdays living influence our mentality, thinking and our attitude to life in general a lot and I must admit, it realy can cause the so called illneses of civilization as heard failure, cerebral stroke, high blood pressure are. All in all, obesity is also concerning with this feature because people find satisfactory in food and overeating. On the contrary, this wealth is the result of the industrial and technical developement. People are able to produce a great number of rests without knowing how to utilize them in proper way and this state has caused the arise of the consumming society which is not prepared to use treasures of the Earth in its full amount.
It can seem I want to fight against the industrial progress and I am a pure naturalist who admires just nature without any interference by human hand with it. Absolutely no! My intention is to show by means of this statement that man can not be happy and contented in the world if he is not able to realize that technology and new inventions do not serve to make harm to people but their reasonable utilization should make human life much more easier and pleasant. Taking everything into consideration, people are responsible for their fortune, easy mind, happiness and their way of living in general, because they themselves have caused this state of things and events. Their imagination and dreaming is based on their decision. I know it is realy dificult but the stoics and the ancient philosoph Plotinos once said that the beauty is foundable in every piece of any thing which is overall of us, so the smallest unit of a thing hides something beautiful which makes the whole thing construsted by these units beautiful. In short, every man is able to find his beauty in the world if he admits to himself that there exist just beautiful things. If he acts, he will soon receive what he wishes. Just open and cheerfull mind will be enough, I suppose.
Well, if this construction worked, there would be so little suiciders, desperate and burnt-out people and a lot of happy, careless and responsible beings with own imagination and creative thinking.
This is just my imagination. I might have go out in streets and make enlightenment among people, unfortunately, I am not an indian guru, I belong neither to a group of australian aborigines. All told, I find these people ones of the happiest beings on this world because they are able to spend their life as it is and they do not Admit any other possibility just being happy and respectful to themselves and to the world around them. I think that the despair of a modern man has its source in his disability to listen to his own wishes and ego along with respecting other animated creatures and also inanimated things which su rrounds him.
Anybody could object that people of this era are fixed to their own minds too much, paradoxicaly; and it contradicts my first suggestions. Well, I admit that people should take care of themselves because they do not know what intention of life the other man follows; but on the contrary, they would have their senses open so as they were able to receive each information coming from their nearest neibourghs who need a help. I think this is the easiest way how to become happy, imaginative and satisfied again, regardless if such man lives in the modern society with all its amenities or in wilderness among wild animals and cruel nature. Yes, the only prescription is to free oneself from own anxiety and rigidity and to start receiving life as a marvelous gift which deserves being enjoyed by full handfulls without wasting it. Keep smiling!

CZUN1006,1.0,2.0,,,,,All armies should consist entirely of professional soldiers: there is no value in a system of military service,"
I am a woman. I do not have to go to an army and spend there twelve months.
Twelve months of doing nothing. You earn no money besides a few hundred crowns of soldiers'pay. If you have a family or some property like a flat that must be paid monthly than you have a problem. In our republic these problems are still not solved. I have a personal experience with it. I am 22 and my boyfriend serves in military service as same as many other boys of his age that have no serious reason why not to be there. He has a new flat. He could not allow regretting it because problems are not only in an army resort but also with housing shortage. His mother pays the rent. She is single and must support his younger brother that stills studies. Our government pays a half of the amount but what if his mother could not have been able to pay? Czech republic is preparing to enter NATO. Our army must answer certain requests. This requires money. Money that is needed in every resort and army is not the most important one. It appears in many regiments. This is why my boyfriend spends a useless year in his regiment. He is doing nothing there. He learns nothing new, nothing that will help him in case of an attack. In my opinion, a meaning of an army is to protect people and country that are attacked. Young men who are made to go to Czech military service are about 18 or 19 years old and they spend a year of their lives there and they are to learn a basic knowledge about weapons, strategy and about how to behave in critical situation. I want to believe that in most of the regiments it already works this way. In the regiment where my boyfriend serves it is still going the old way. Soldiers from this regiment are to keep guard over oil-tanks. They keep guarding and keep guarding and doing nothing else. I cannot help myself but I thing it is really a restless year. Nevertheless, I believe that in today's world it is necessary to have a professional army as same as a military service. People should know how to protect themselves and homes and families. Although you can object that in our times only one bomb can be enough to destroy everything and the only thing that remains is the hope. But I guess that it is always better to feel prepared. I did not think like that a few months ago. I believed is a safe place to live where people sometimes do fight but that these conflicts are so far from our country that they cannot influence our lives. Later on I found out that our Earth is a very small place where any step even the smallest one influences events that follow. Conflicts that take place ex-Yugoslavia, in Iraqi or between Israel and Palestine or in some African states are not that far. They are also our business. Since the time when I started to watch TV news more carefully I am still more and more afraid about what can happen. I feel like if people are standing on the edge and now they must decide which way to go. Fights, wars and other conflicts just waste time and the time are not inexhaustible. I think that solving these problems is a priority. Countries that are rich must try to help those poor ones that can be easy spoils for aggressive countries. That is why I think that at least men must be prepared because we must show that we are. able to protect our selves. I wish I were more optimistic. Even though I am not a religious person I believe in some higher power that is above us and follows us. We must help our selves alone. Our lives are in our hands.

George Orwell was influenced by his experience from his staying in Soviet Union when he wrote one of his famous books Animal Farm. What he saw he put into one short saying:  All animals are equal: but some are more equal than others. ""  This was fifty years ago and he tried to describe communist society.
Now almost in 21st century when the communist empire was destroyed we have the effort to say that all this injustice is away. Is this opinion correct?
I would definitely say - not. If I follow the argumentation of George Orwell, there are still countries that are led by communist or neocommunist government. Every day we can read in newspapers about different sorts of injustice that happened in China, Cuba or somewhere else. In these countries is created special class that has the advantages that the rest of people have not. They have not the advantages because they would not be able enough. They have not them because they do not belong to the special party or they do not have correct friends. I do not want to say that this kind of intrigues and socalled friendship take place only in totalitarian countries. It definitely happens everywhere, nevertheless, this political system gives many opportunities for such activities. Reason why it happens is simple. The government cannot be controlled by the people. The election does not give the ordinary people any chance to change the government because they cannot choose different people. Everything is led by the class or party that was given preferential treatment.
Now I want to discuss another type of equality or unequality among people. The democratic countries give the people definitely more chances to be equal and when the people feel that they are not, they still have a tool for changing it. This is the election where the people can choose the party or a person that gives them guarantee of change.
Very important problem is the race discrimination. This discrimination or unequality between people of different colour of skin can be not only material but also spiritual. It is very often in all democratic countries that the Afro-Americans or Gypsies get a lower salary for the same work than the white people. These people are not equal. The government more or less tries fight against it and sometimes it could skip into reversed discrimination. Typical example is the attempt of an official Gypsy party that want 10 Gypsy policemen in every city. They do not care whether the Gypsies have the qualification to do that, they are interested only in numbers and limits. These people are not equal too. The target of government is easy - find a compromise that would not favour or discriminate any people.
When I talked about the material discrimination I was almost sure that this problem is resolvable. For me, bigger problem is how to equalise different people in their minds. How to explain them that no race has special position and has the power to lead other races. In the countries that just became democratic it will take a long time. I think so because of my personal experience from the United States where the democratic tradition lasts for more than two hundred years. In 19th century the segregation was officially accepted and in 20th century it still happened.
So that it is very easy for them to criticise the racial problem in the postcommunist countries, but it is little bit hypocritical. They have too short memory.
George Orwell would be true if he said: "" I had a dream. In the end of 2Oth century all men were equal: but some were more equal than others"" .

CZUN1028,2.5,3.0,,,,,"In the words of the old song: ""Money is the root of all evil""","
What does money represent to you ? When I asked my very good friend this question he answered ""nothing"" but I did not take him seriously as he was drunk.
If you were asked this question what would you think of ? Would you think of the rent you have got to pay or food, clothes, nice holiday ? Whatever feelings this word evokes we all need money to buy things necessary for our living, unless we live on a farm and are completely self-sufficient.
Money represents the most powerful element in the world. The richest banks and large international syndicates are the most powerful institutions which manipulate the politicians. Money manipulates not only politicians but a lot of others, though they are unwilling to admit it. Sometimes people sell their souls for the money or even worse they are able to kill for them. Money destroys relationships between people, often they are the main reason for quarells between members of family and often lead to a divorce. Money also has a negative effect on children. Those children who have a lot of money do not seem to value anything, they take everything for granted. They also have enough money to buy themselves alcohol, cigarettes and sometimes even drugs. As we can see, money can do a lot of harm and in this sense the popular saying 'money is the root of all evil' seems to be justified.
Nevertheless, look at money from a different point of view. Money represents to us a lot of pleasant things. Nearly everybody I know has sometime in their live dreamt of winning a big sum of money in a lottery. It is a dream of millions of people. It is so because money represents to us many opportunities to make our dreams come true. For some it is the opportunity to travel all over the world, for others bying house or paying for their studies.
Nevertheless, the second aspect mentioned I still believe that money is the root of all evil. I am not saying that I do not like money. I would lie. I myself had a time when I imagined what I would do if I was lucky and won some money in a lottery. But that does not mean that I do not realise the danger money can bring. I have read many real-life stories where people said how money had ruined their lives. There were stories in the magazines where people desribed how after winning in a lottery their lives became miserable. The causes for that were different. Thoses people afterwards admitted that before winning the money they were happier. In most cases it is the envy that causes the problems. Envy and problems connected with it.
This actually leads us to a conclusion, that it is not the money which causes the trouble but human nature, because if there was not money, the world would be full of evil anyway.

DBAN1003,3.0,3.5,3.0,3.0,3.5,,All armies should consist entirely of professional soldiers: there is no value in a system of military service,"
In more than twenty or thirty countries at the same time, people are fighting with each other. They disagree with each other for political, social, economic, geographical or other reasons and sooner or later at one side the pressure becomes so high that they fly at those by whom they are put at a disadvantage: they mobilize an army and start an armed conflict. In order to have a good army several factors are of significant importance: troops, a lot of equipment, an enormous amount of money, a strict hierarchy combined with a strong and decisive leadership, political and ethnic will and so on. But can it be said that a compulsory military service is equally important?
To start out with, let us have a closer look at the importance of troops, which can certainly be defined as the alpha and omega of all warfare. But the number of troops is becoming less important in times of modern warfare. In the past, mpaybe even until The first World Ward, the soldiers of the different camps were often literary fighting against one another. In such a situation the number of troops was important indeed and in a conflict as big as the First World War, so many soldiers were needed that the whole population was forced to participate to avoid being bulldozed away. In such a situation it was not so bad an idea to create compulsory military service since everybody was needed.
Technology, however, has changed this. The most evident example is the Gulf War. How many American soldiers did actually make it to the battlefield? Not that many! The Gulf War was a technological war: technology made it possible for fighter planes to bomb a place with an incredible precision in the middle of the black night. Technology allowed satellites to find out where the enemy was placing its rocket launchers and made it even possible to send patriot rockets to destroy the enemy's oncoming missiles. In modern times, it comes all down to having better equipment than that of the enemy and the more modern stuff you have, the less persons you need to handle it. This already implies that no longer everybody is required to participate. A professional army can already be considered at this stage, but there are more arguments to welcome it. Men used to be conscripted to learn how to handle a gun and other similar activities. But in modern times there is technology which requires specialists such as engineers, pilots, physicists and so on. Driving a tank, to list another example, was in thepast far more easy than in the present time. The skill that is required of these men is a lot higher and it is a waste of time to try to make an enormous number of soldiers who are only there for a couple of months meet these requirements. That would be a waste of money so badly needed to produce an even more competent technology.
Another advantage offered by a professional army is the fact that those who are part of it are undoubtedly a lot more ambitious than those who are conscripted against their will. Compulsion causes inefficiency, which is very costly as well.
A system of military service has certainly offered many advantages and has led to many important victories, but in modern with a view to modern warfare it is becoming inefficient compared with a professional army.

DBAN1004,3.5,3.0,2.5,,,,The prison system is outdated. No civilized society should punish its criminals: it should rehabilitate them,"
Of course criminals can be subdivided in so many classes. A criminal who is prison for theft does, or rather may, not be punished the same way as murderers are. The criminal's state of mind is crucial to decide whether rehabilitation will help the criminal to reintegrate in the society or not. A criminal who is mentally disturbed has very little chance to become a funtional element whitin the society after rehabilitation. But those criminals who have commmitted crime because of external factors and prove to be mentally healthy, can really benefit from rehabilitation. They make a chance to become again funtional elements whitin the society. The big problem, as always, is the lack of funds for these rehabilitation programmes. The government does not have the money to finance these programmes. That is the reason why conservative governments in Great Britain (Thatcher) and in the United States (Reagan) started the privatization of prisons many years ago.
Wolds (Yorkshire), managed by ""Group 4 Remand Services"", is the only private prison at the moment in Great Britain, but another 5 prisons are to be privatized. The private prisons are far more popular in the US. These private prisons actually make profits thanks to the prisoners' labour. But these profits are used for rehabilitation and reintegration programmes. Most of all the private prisons cost the government only 24 $ per day for each prisoner while the federal prisons receive 30 $ per day for each prisoner. That is the reason why Clinton's new Reform Bill provides the construction of new prisons, including private prisons.
An excellent example is the Corrections Corporation which manages 23 prisons all over the US which provide rehabilitation programmes for drug addicts, education (even higher education) and professional training for their prisoners.
I think the Corrections Corporation shows how prisons should be like. Prisons should not be a place where criminals are just punished and where they ""serve their time"". On the contrary, prisons should be a place where criminals, who usually have lost the real sense of life, get a chance to recapture these human values. It has really no sense to impose too strict disciplines just to get back on these people. It would only worsen the situation. If these people feel that the society rejects them, it is very obvious that they do not want to be part of this egoistic society, that they will not even try to reintegrate in a society which rejects them. And when these people get out of prison, they will try to react against the society and they will revert to the same old habit, namely committing crimes. Whereas these criminals should want to reintegrate and funtion whitin the society.
This means that things go wrong at the very beginning, namely when they are sent to the overcrowded prisons. And the private prisons at least try to take care of this problem. They organize rehabilitation and reintegration programmes to help the prisoners to relive the society in a whole different way. After these programmes the prisoners usually want to build a whole new life, and this time without crime. And is this not the very reason why criminals are sent to prson: to try to convert these criminals, to make them realise that they have done something wrong and to make them want to change their lives? Now, this will not be reached by punishing the criminals but only by rehabilitation and reintegration programmes. Only when prisons adapt this latter phylosophy, they may be regarded as dignified prisons.

DBAN1005,4.0,3.0,,,,,"Some people say that in our modern world, dominated by science and technology and industrialisation, there is no longer a place for dreaming and imagination. What is your opinion?","
Ever since man has existed, he has been dreaming about how to make life easier, with continuous inventions as a result. Starting with what are now called 'simple' inventions, like fire and the wheel, he has used his imagination to realize more and more sophisticated wishes. Today, most people in our modern society are furnished with the most basic facilities and even much more. Science technology and industrialization dominate our society, but can we go that far to state that there is nolonger place for dreaming and imagination?
Just as all inventors before us, who needed all of their imagination to find a solution for a problem, people today go on trying to find new solutions for new problems, using as well all of their imagination. On the one hand, it is true of course, that most of them are professional researchers or scientists and that only very few are amateurs who happen to have en 'Eureka' experience. Still, both groups of inventors need a lot of imagination. On the other hand, I agree with those who say that, concerning professional research, most of the work is done by routing programs and investigations, every time more and more extended, and then analyzed and processed by the computer. It seems as if dreams or imagination are no longer welcome in this scientific world.
So far, I have only been talking about inventions and science, but what about the children's world? Children have always been great dreamers and they are said to have an enormous imagination, making new games or new words, fantasizing about everything, living in their own fantasy world. So why would they not anymore? Even if TV, video and computer games, or other technological things leave few space for dreaming and imagination, children will still be children. Except for some extreme cases where children -or people- have become numb and a-critical, unable to have a proper opinion or to think for themselves, I think that science and technology can never make an end to dreams and imaginaiton.
Furthermore, fantasy is important in many other areas besides science and children's plays; literature and art for instance are two other branches that have always existed on fantasy and imagination. Without his inspiration a writer would never be able to publish a new book, article, study etc. And as no machine has ever managed to successfully write a complete work (nor has it managed to mak a fully acceptable translation), authors will still rely on their inventiveness and talent to survive; the same rule can be applied to artists. New exhibitions, novels, etc show that their creativeness seems to be inexhaustible - and I am convinced it always will -, with every day more and worldwide success and interest. Again I have no argument to state that dreams and imagination have ceased to exist.
In my short article, I have tried to show that I am not of the same opinion with people who say that in our modern society there is no place left for dreaming and imagination. Although I understand their opinion to some extent that dreaming and imagination seem to have less space every day - certainly because of alienation, numbness, a-criticism, etc. -, I am convinced that, no matter how science and industrialization may evolve, dreaming and imagination are inextricably bound up with our existence. Let's hope I am not living in a dream world...

DBAN1006,3.5,2.5,,,,,The prison system is outdated. No civilized society should punish its criminals: it should rehabilitate them,"
Everybody knows that the prisons in Belgium are overcrowded. The prisoners have to live there in almost unhuman circumstances, crammed together like animals. Therefore, it is time that we start to work out a new prison system.
I do not agree with the statement that we should stop punishing our criminals and instead rehabilitate them. In my opinioin, we have to change the whole prison system. First of all, we have to split up the prisoners in different groups, in accordance with what they have done. For some of these groups, we can introduce rehabilitation programmes.
The first group are people who have killed someone. For this gorup, we must reintroduce the death penalty. A lot of people are afraid to die. I think that the number of murders will decrease, because the murderer knows that he will meet with the same fate as his victim. It is not fare that a person who is condemned to 5 years in prison, can be released after 3 years for good behaviour. Such people should be locked up for the rest of their lifes or should get the death penalty. Rehabilitation programmes do not work for this group of criminals.They are observed by social workers and psychiatrists and they know that if they behave and show remorse, they will be released earlier. But I think that persons who have murdered several people, will always start again, because it is in their head.
The second group of crimes include robbery, house-breaking, holdups, shoplifting,... These people form a large group in the prisons and therefore need to be reduced. Another problem that is closely related to these crimes is drugs. A lot of these criminals are often drug addicts, who need money for their stuff and therefore start to steal and rob. It is no use to put these people together in a ward of the prison, because it will not solve the problem. They go on dealing in the prison and most prisoners are more addicted when they are released than when they entered. So for this group we need serious rehabilitation programmes.
First of all, they have to undergo a detoxification. By this I do not mena changing from heroin to methadon, because it does not solve the problem, you only create another kind of addicts. I mena a complete stop of all kinds of drugs. when they are completely clean, they have to be prepared to reenter a normal life, without going back to drugs and crime. Most of the time these criminals are young people, so in order to keep them off the streets, we must make sure that they learn a trade or obtain a diploma. The United States have proved that this is possible. In several prisons, criminals can obtain a diploma of higher education. It proves that these people are motivated and that they want to built up a better life.
The third group of criminals are rapers and rapers and peadophiles. We also need special programmes for these people, because I think that they are mentally ill. They must be treated in special clinics and if it is proved that they are capable again to lead a lifeof their own, social workers must continue to keep an eye on them.
If all these measures would be taken into account, the prisons would not be so overcrowded. it does not mean an end to the prison system, but it would be a lot more efficient. The crime rate would also strongly reduce and this is of course the main objective of all this measures. Because everybody wants to live in a safe society.

DBAN1011,3.0,4.0,,,,,The prison system is outdated. No civilized society should punish its criminals: it should rehabilitate them,"
We are dealing with some serious problems in the present day society and one of these is that the prison system is outdated, it should be adapted to modern times. First I am going to describe what the problem really is, then I will sum up the causes and finally we will try to find a way to change the present situation.
Several things make the prison system outdated. The prisons are first of all overcrowded so that they become inhuman to live in. This also makes the tension rise between the inhabitants who generally are not the easiest people to live with. Secondly, the guards can not cope with their work anymore because they are short of staff and they are underpaid, moreover their work is not much appreciated and it is a dangerous job because of the frequent violence. So it would be better to rehabilitate criminals instead of locking them up in a prison cell, because no attention is paid to their mental problems.
The causes of the problem are simple. Government does not consider the problem to be that important and it has worked for centuries, so why should they change the system while they have so many other, more important, things to take care of. Moreover, there is not enough money to pay for major changes like employing psychiatrists or sociologists for private counselling of the prisoners.
So now that we have taken a closer look at the problem, I think we could agree that something has to be done about it. That is the most difficult part, because if it was easy to find an answer, something would already have been done about it. First, we should begin to make government aware of the problem so that they can supply more money to employ more staff in the prisons. With this I mean skilled staff like psychiatrists and sociologists but also people who have been taught how to deal with violence and criminals. Furthermore, judges should be made aware of the problem so that they can give other sentences like rehabilitation or community service.
To conclude, I think I have made it clear that we have a serious problem of which only few people are aware. Governments certainly have to realize that things will have to change in a very near future because if they do not, society will be at risk. To show our concern, we could organize marches or do something else with the help of Amnesty International. Private initiatives should also be promoted. Like writing letters to prisoners and let them know you want to listen to their problems. Just do not think you can not help these people because you can, everybody can if he or she is willing to do something!

DBAN1014,3.0,3.5,,,,,All armies should consist entirely of professional soldiers: there is no value in a system of military service,"
For many years there has been the expression: .
Up to last year, every boy, beginning from the age of 18, had to go in military service. A duty which was often feared by a lot of young men. Since the beginning of this year one has done away with this army conscription, to the pleasure of many!
A lot of young men spent their ten months in the army with a bad grace, ten months during which they couldn't earn anything. If you were young it didn't really matter that much, but a lot of boys, who first wanted to get a degree at university (and who had to apply every year again during their studies for a deferment) were 24, 25 years old before they could go to the army. An age at which one starts to think of making money and getting married. To them it were ten months of total loss.
On top of all this, more and more men started to find out all kind of excuses for not having to go in military service. After all, why should they have to go while their younger brothers, or their best friends who were the youngest in their families, didn't have to go!
Okay, they taught you how to behave in case of a war, how to hold a gun, how to drive a tank and how to camouflage etc. But why should we fear a war here in Belgium, now in these modern times, with all the negotiations between the western countries, with the worldwide organization of NATO and the United Nations and with the development of the European Comunity? Even in the most powerful country of the world, the United States of America, there is no compulsory military service. And still do they have a very powerful army.
So, in 2992, the former Minister of Defence, Leo Delcroix, decided that from the beginning of 1994 army conscription had to be done away with. However, all boys who had applied for a deferment during their studies the last years, still had to go in service.
Nowadays there are still enough young men who want to become soldiers, who want adventure and become para commandos. So in case of a war somewhere in a foreign country, these young men are sent to the war zones: boys who have had a good training and who earn their money spending their time in the army.
We have learned enough of the last World War. In those times every young man, whether they were in military service or not, had to go to the front to fight. So if a new war should break out here in Belgium (which is rather impossible), every healthy young man will probably be drafted anyway - and who knows, maybe even every young woman. And people can offer a lot of resistance when it comes to defending not only your country but especially your family, friends and yourself.
There is therefore absolutely no use in obliging young men to waste their time for ten months in the army. They are far better off in the real world where they can also become men while doing something they really want to do!

In six months time the incredible student life will be over again for some people.
They will set foot in the real world and start working in the field of their studies, at least that is what they hope for.
But will these students find work immediately and will it be in the right field, meaning will they get a function according to their training?
Recent statistics show that the unemployment figure in Belgium has dropped slightly, compared to A992-1993. This, however, does not mean that whenever a person graduates he is offered a job right a way. The tendency nowadays in Belfium is that the majority of gradautes have to wait for about six months before they are hired under the  (a governmental initiative helping young people to find a job).
In many cases they are fired after six months and have to start all over again.
This of course is a very annoying situation, but what, to me, is even more annoying, is the fact that ""experience"" is always required.
Just fold the newspaper open and take a look at job advertisements; you will rarely find an add where a person with no experience qualifies the prospect.
My question then is, ""how can a just graduated, fresh ex-student, have experience""?
Let us look at the translators/interpreting section for example. It seems that most colleges or universities for translators and interpreters are not familiar with the situation of apprenticeships, contrary to the hotelmanagement section, where students can go abroad for four months and work in hotels.
Future social workers and nurses also have to work in their branch for a certain period and are evaluated then.
Would it not be better for all colleges and universities to introduce these apprenticeships, so that students are already aware of what they are getting into, instead of just throwing them to the wolves when they graduate?
Now we have come to the issue of doing exams in order to pas. For some courses the situation of permanent evaluation already exists, but for most subjects you still have to take an exam.
Is this a fair system?
In my opinion it is not, because you are evaluated on two or three questions taken from a book of maybe threehundred pages. If you are lucky you can answer these questions. If not, too bad, then you are nicely invited to take your exam again in September, even though you knew the rest of your book perfectly well.
In my opinion apprenticeships and permanent evaluation are the perfect solution; you are judged by experts in the field, who can keep an eye on you all day, whereas at college or university a professor has to spread his or her time over 20 students or more.
The conclusion we can only make is that universities and colleges really have to take action to reform these situations, not today but yesterday.

DBAN1017,3.5,3.5,,,,,Most university degrees are theoretical and do not prepare students for the real world. They are therefore of very little value,"
The latest years it has become very difficult to find a job. It is often even moredifficult to find a job if you have a university degree than if you have a lower one. Is this because most university degrees are theoretical and therefore do not prepare students enough for the real world?
It is true that people who are for example a plumber or a technician do not need a university diploma and they can often find a job after they have finished their secondary school. These people are indeed trained to practise a certain profession and most of the time they have to do a work placement during their training.
People who have a university degree, on the other hand, have almost or no practise during their education, the only thing they have are a lot of books or courses they have to know by heart. Unfortunately, students at a university also do not do a work placement in their last year.
I think it is a pity that most university education do not have a work placement for their students in their last year, but if that really is not possible, I think the students themselves shoud have to prepare for the real world. There are several ways to do so.
In the first place, the students can prepare by acquiring knowledge about all kinds of things. During their student days, they should read a lot of books, newspapers and magazines. That way they learn a lot about politics, economics, culture and so on. The school can not learn you all these things, but you need to have a general knowledge if you want to become a part of the real world.
Secondly, the students should insert a work placement themselves. They can, for example, go studying at a university in another country for one year, take a course abroad for a month during the holidays or do a holiday job in a company. By doing a holiday job they learn what real life is all about, they get to know life in a company and moreover they earn some money.
In the third place, I think that students should not only learn their books and courses by heart because they have to know the material for the exams, but they should really try to see the importance of all the things they learn for later life. Unfortunately, some students keep studying only for the exams and do not see the importance of a general knowledge.
To conclude, I agree that university degrees are too theoretical and therefore they do not prepare students enough for the real world. But university degrees are not at all of little value if the students themselves complement their studies with some general knowledge, a course abroad or a vacation job. Besides, in my opinion, one of the characteristics of a university degree is that the people who have it are independent people, who are, with or without a lot of practical training, very ready for the real world.

DBAN1021,4.0,3.0,,,,,"Some people say that in our modern world, dominated by science and technology and industrialisation, there is no longer a place for dreaming and imagination. What is your opinion?","
All their lives people have dreams and imagination, whether they are poor or rich, happy or unhappy. The ability to dream is not a temporal one and is certainly not related to the kind of society we live in. Dreaming is a typical characteristic of human beings, whether they lived in a primitive society or in a modern world. Sometimes peole rely on their dreams to face the reality of everyday life. Dreams can encourage people to go on, and what's more, they can even represent a certain goal they want to achieve. Our society has become one of technology, modernisation and money-making. All over the world scientists are very busy experimenting and trying out new techniques, but does that mean that people can no longer have imagination? Certainly not! Modern technology can even be very helpful when it comes to dreaming or imagining, and the same goes for science.
The ability to dream and open up one's mind for imagination is a human talent that already begins during childhood. Think, for example, of those wonderful movies created by Walt Disney. Children are fascinated by the different characters brought to life on de cinema screen. They are carried away emotionally while watching them. Why? Because they can open up their minds for imagination and fantasy. When those little ones have grown up they think back of those times and cherish their unforgettable experiences. Sometimes grown ups want to bring back their childhood dreams and let the child hidden in them rise to the surface. Lots of adults adore fairy-tales and want to watch them on home video or even go to these fun parks like for example Disneyworld. How would that be possible if it weren't for technology?
Dreams can also be very concrete. People can realise their dreams by turning them into their goals in life. Think for example of students whose dream it is to become a doctor. Why would they want to become a doctor? Maybe they have this ambitious dream of helping people, using their knowledge and capability. Soem of them even go to faraway places life Africa to fight starvation and other diseases endangering the lives of the natives. But, then again, none of this would be possible without science!
Sometimes people feel the need to escape from reality. In everyday life people are confronted with difficulties, grief, boredom, etc. That is why people seek ways to run away from all that and in order to do so they use their imagination. A good example is that of the writer who isolates himself fromthe rest of the world while sitting in his own private room, working on his latest novel. Another example is that of the artist with his endless source of imagination and creativity.
In a way, everything that has ever been made, even the most ordinary things, is the result of someone's creativity and imagination. Every concrete realisation started from a concept, an idea that grew out of one's imagination and that became a reality thanks to the possibilities of our modern, industrialised world full of possibilities and new things to discover.

In his novel Animal Farm, George Orwell wrote . This statement is certainly true today, it always has been and it will probably always be true. Not only in the way George Orwell meant it, but in many other ways too. I would like to illustrate that by means of some examples which, as you will see, are very diverse; but that only demonstrates the validness of the statement in all sections of our contemporary society.
Animal Farm is a parody of the communist regime in Russia under Stalin. Communism preaches equality for all men, but Stalin abused that ideology to become the most terrible dictator Russia has ever known. He controlled the Russian people politically, economically, militarily and moreover, he controlled the Russian people's minds. The worst of it was, however, that the common man really believed in him, he believed that Stalin wanted the best for everyone, that Stalin would see to it that all people were treated equally. Stalin exercised such a power over the common man that the latter did not realize or did not mind that Stalin and his friends made themselves ""more equal"" than the others. Stalin is dead now, but dictatorial regimes that pretend to lead democratic nations still exist.
The above described is an extreme example of Orwell's statement, but the same truth also occurs, more often than we realize, in everyday situations with everyday people and it can adopt very subtile forms. Take for instance two persons, mister Smith and mister Jones. Mister Smith is very smart and elocuent and always full of bright ideas, while mister Jones is not that bright and does not quite know how to formulate his ideas; he admires mister Smith and wishes he were as bright as he is. Although in the eyes of the law both men are equal, in a discussion for instance the former will be more equal than the latter; although mister Smith's idea might be just as good as mister Jones's one, mister Smith, if he is convinced that he is right, will talk mister Jones down.
Let me give you another example. The Belgian law states that all Belgians are equal. But what about naturalized Belgians, immigrants who have gained the Belgian nationality, who are thus Belgians in the eyes of the law? Right-wing extremists simply want these people, whom they consider inferior, out of Belgium, but also a lot of other people will have to admit, if they want to be honest, that they feel themselves ""more equal"" than those people when it comes to applying for a job for instance. There is not even equality in the way native Belgians treat the different groups of immigrants. Englishmen, naturalized or not, Frenchmen, Germans, Americans for instance are considered to be ""more equal"" than Turks or Moroccans.
And what does the notion equality mean in practice in that big country that is supposed to be the most democratic nation of all, the United States of America?  is the most famous article of the Declaration of Independence, but is that how the blacks in the Harlem ghettos feel? In theory, they may be equal, but in the harsh reality of their everyday lives they are most certainly not equal to their white compatriots. Quite a number of blacks have made it though, in the world of entertainment, sports, politics, medicine or law, and they get the respect they deserve, but that makes it only worse for the ones who are not so lucky.
And I could go on and on, but that is not necessary; just look around and you will realize that what George Orwell wrote all these decades ago is still true today.

In the constitutions of so-called democratic and other countries, one phrase is alway emphasized: . This shows again the frowned upon, hypocritical attitude of our beloved politicians, because in what follows I intend to prove the contrary; we might say Orwell was right in stating: .
Let us first have a look at something closely related to our daily lives: the battle between the sexes, now probably being fought more fiercely than ever under influence of feminism. It all even starts in adolescence: when teenagers are getting a romantic interest in the other sex, boys still tend to look upon girls as the traditional sex-objects. Good looks, blonde hair and endless legs are all that count. Girls are not supposed to have own opinions, but to add to the boys' image. If hi can't boast with his newest catch, he dumps her. So even in the age of innocence, the inequality begins: boys can be intellectual, have a say in everything, but for girls the old French saying still counts: . And I thought all men were created equal. But one might think this pattern ought to disappear with the years. Well, that one's wrong! Because when men and women start looking for a job, it all happens all over again. Women have to fight to be accepted as intellectual human beings while men get the jobs thrown into their laps. And I thought all men were created equal.
Even our good old friends of the Catholic Church join in: only men can be ordinated, women can only function as lay assistents. What have we done to deserve this? Has it ever occurred to them that women might even be better at the job? But! The pope refuses cathegorically: men are in, women are out. And they always say all men are created equal.
Next to women, there do exist some male victims who share this inequality with their female colleagues: prisoners. They are always kept away from society as far as possible. But has it ever occurred to anyone that it would be better to put them in the middle of the society that causes their problem. They have to learn to deal with that society instead of being kept in isolation miles and miles away. They don't get a chance to solve their problem. And I thought all men were created equal. Also in most countries, and certainly in ours, every human being who should need it can benefit from social security. But those who need it most, at the verge of a Gran Canon never seen before, don't get this chance: our prisoners. So that's wht they call equal?
The next subject I'd like to touch upon is at the same time the most protected: royalty. Belgium is said to be democratic. But can becoming a king or member of the royal family by chance (birth is not really something that you decide for yourself) and thus also enjoying wealth, luxury and prestige by chance be regarded as democratic? I thought democracy was supposed to give everyone a say in what happens in this country? So why can't we, the people, decide who we want for a king? Not really equal, if you ask me!
In this essay I have tried to prove Orwell's idea  by giving evidence in the form of examples from our own society, our daily lives. As I have tried to make clear, there is still a lot of work to do. And as I fully realize not everyone shares this way of thinking. Therefore I can only join in with Martin Luther King when he says: .

DBAN1029,3.0,3.0,,,,,"In his novel ""Animal Farm"" George Orwell wrote ""All men are equal but some are more equal than others"". How true is this today?","
In the novel ""Animal Farm"" of George Orwell, the pigs replace the Seven Commandments by one pronouncement . If we look at the world today, is it still true that some people have more rights than others? Before the law all man are equal but is this so in reality?
Like in ""Animal Farm"" it is often so that in a society some people assume leadership or gain it by promising people a better life. Once they are the leader these promises are soon gone and they start misusing their power and become a dictator. Look at Lenin in Russia.
In other societies the leader does give all people equal rights but still there will always be people who have more rights. Royals and politicians always have more rights than an ordinary citizen. They drive around in luxury cars, wear expensive clothees, etc. while citizens have to work hard to keep a living and some of them can't find a job and have a miserable life.
The inequality is even more visible in daily life: For example a policeman who is off duty parks his car wrong but he won't get a fine because he is a policeman.
Another example; when two people with the same qualities apply for a job, the most beautiful of the two will be appointed. This of course is highly unfair to the other one.
When applying for a holiday job, relatives of the people working in the company will always be taken first. But why? When you don't know anyone working in a big company, you won't have a chance to get the job. It is no use to apply for it because they won't take you.
One last example we find in the Belgium law system. Judges are almost always appointed because of their political services. This of course causes politicization of the magistrature.
Inequality is also visible in the discrimination of women. Although things have improved, women are still not equal to man. For example there are still jobs which are not open to women, women are not allowed in the national football team,... In Belgium, until last year, women were not allowed to become Queen.
In a lot of families the wife still has to do the dishes, cook, take care of the children while the man sits in his chair and reads the paper. Why don't these women get paid for their work? They work just as hard as anyone else maybe even harder.
Nowadays situations have improved though but when we look back upon the past, we often see that some people are m ore equal than others. Look at the blacks in America, how long haven't they had to be slaves? And when slavery was forbidden, they were still discriminiated by the whites. They had to give up their seats to white people in the bus. They did not get a proper education and had to do everything separate from whites. Also the Indians have not been treated fair. Columbus just took over their land and killed as many Indians as possible. And what about Hitler who tried to ruine the Jewish people?
Another situation of inequality in the past: Before all people were allowed to vote, the rich would take all the power and the poor people didn't have anything to say.
So the pronouncement of George Orwell in his novel ""Animal Farm"" that some people are more equal than others sure does still count today and always has. In almost every aspect of daily life we see inequality.

DBAN1031,4.0,,,,,,"In his novel ""Animal Farm"" George Orwell wrote ""All men are equal but some are more equal than others"". How true is this today?","
In his novel Animal Farm, George Orwell wrote that all men are equal, but that some are more equal than others. That view is not a mere phantasy. Even today in our 'wonderful democracy' Orwell's idea can be found in every imaginable situation.
The inequality of different people can be measured by the way they are treated by society. Racial, religious or similar reasons often originate in people being treated different than others. Those reasons can be classified as personal; discussing those would result in an endless text about racism, inquisitions etcetera. Another class of reasons would be the non-personal ones; people are treated differently because of reasons other than their own abilities or physical qualities. Certain factors influence society or people representing society to treat particular people in particular ways.
A highly skilled university student applies for the job of professor at a well know university. she can not convince the dean by her skills, but a large sum of money or some personal services after hours would secure her job. A first factor is the power of possession, in which we include money and sex. One person can be treated different from another because he or she can provide the ones they need something from with certain things. Such thing is often called bribery. Whether bribes are paid with cash, a villa in the South of France or someone to spend the night with, that does not matter; essentially it is all the same.
In a hospital a miner is brought in who needs a liver transplantation urgently. The operation is prepared and in the last minute before they start a Lord is brought in with the same need for a liver, but only one organ is available. The miner dies and the Lord will live. A second factor would be the social hierarchy. People will lick upwards and kick downwards so that people at the bottom of the social ladder will get no favours, while the people on top of it will usually not have the slightest problem with getting things done the way they want it. The gap between poor and rich is a consequence of that phenomenon.
A new landing strip will not be built on the north end of the airport because of the nature reserve there. On the side the strip is planned now lives a man who knows the city mayor well. The trees had to go down to make place for the landing strip. A third factor could be called favoritism, nepotism or the politics of the old school tie. In situations ranging from applying for a job to getting a scholarship granted to go study abroad it is extremely important to know which strings can be pulled, otherwise the chances of getting something or somewhere diminish considerably.
As long as people do not want to change their principles in the previous mentioned cases, the inequality of mankind will always exist. So for the next few decades no great revolutions should be expected.

DBAN1034,3.5,2.5,,,,,Feminists have done more harm to the cause of women than good,"
. When I read this statement it occurred to me that - considering the absurdity of the statement - it was most likely written by a member of the threatened sex, a man. Thanks to the feminist movement women have gained the same rights as men in several respects, legally, politically, socially and economically. In my opinion, women can therefore not underestimate the value of the feminist movement. If there is a dark side to the coin at all, it will only be for men!
First of all, if it were not for the feminist movement, I would not be writing this essay at the moment. But as modern women we have become completely accustomed to certain rights that were not at all obvious for our great-grandmothers.
Nowadays women have the choice between ""staing at home"" and ""working outdoors"". Before the industrial revolution they had no choice at all, it was culturally-determined that women stayed at home and took care of the household. If a married woman did go to work it was regarded as an offence against her husband, who was then considered unable to make a living for the whole family, without the help of his wife.
The modern woman, however, fills a double or threefold task: housewife, mother and working woman. On this point it might be argued that there is a dark side to the coin, the depreciation of the housewife and the little free time of the working woman.
The first problem, the low opinion of the housewife, shows that the feminist movement has not become superflouous. In the modern society, militant feminism is no longerr effective, instead we have reached a stage of debat. The ideal for the future is a change of mentality, a situation of mutual respect.
Men and women should cooperate and respect one another. Women should strive for equality but that does not mean they should become men! A woman should remain a woman. We should do away with the stereotype feminist, the man-hating matron who looks more like a man than a woman. Most men still feel threatened by succesful carreerwomen, they may even feel hurt in their male ego if they have to accept orders from a woman. Men should learn to respect the individual character of the woman.
The second problem, the little free time of the working woman, can be solved in the same way: a change of mentality, cooperation of husband and wife, for example, division of the household chores.
Another right we now have thanks to our feminist predecessors is the voting right. But still, like business, politics is mainly a man's world. More than hundred years after the voting right for women, the percentage of women in politics is very low. Recently a law has been passed that states that one fourth of the electoral candidates should be women, this is certainly a step in the right direction.
In conclusion, women have certainly benefitted from the feminist movement. But it is clear that some very important work remains to be done, especially as far as the mentality of men is conerned. Maybe men have forgotten the fact that every human being starts as a woman.

DBAN2001,3.5,,,,,,All armies should consist entirely of professional soldiers: there is no value in a system of military service,"
Compulsory military service has been abolished in Belgium, where it has always been a controversial issue. The 1994 batch wasn't drafted into military service because finally Leo Delcroix decided to abolish it and create an army that entirely consists of professional soldiers. According to a majority of people, and especially according to youngsters, this decision was worth its weight in gold. It meant that they didn't have to waste a year of their life in the army any more.
When joining the army is compulsory, the army is a lot bigger than it would be when it was just an army of professional soldiers. That means the costs involved are very high and, of course, this money has to come from the tax payers. But now that it isn't compulsory any more, and therefore not so extensive, the costs have decreased.
Moreover, the idea of compulsory military service is out of date. Belgium doesn't need an army that consists of youngsters fresh out of school who don't even want to be in the army. Our country needs a professional army that can be deployed to help in the ex-Yugoslavia or Rwanda for instance. Belgium needs soldiers that have been trained sufficiently so that they can do their job properly.
There has always been a lot of protest against it. People said that when you have to join the army, you lose a year of your life. During that year you can't look for a job or you can't go into higher education.
It is believed that you become a man in the army and that youngsters learn the meaning of words such as discipline and responsability. But by the time you join the army you should already know how to behave responsibly, you should already know the meaning of discipline. The only positive thing about the army is that youngsters leaving it are usually in the pink of condition. But this doesn't measure up to the advantages of a professional army.
An army that entirely consists of professional soldiers is always very motivated because it consists of volunteers, that means people who choose for joining the army themselves. So everyone can still go into the armed forces, but only if you want to.
Professional soldiers also receive better and more efficient training. If the United Nations make an appeal to Belgium to send our armed forces somewhere, we can be proud of the fact that we can send professionals.
if you compare a professional army that combines motivation with efficiency to one that consists of youngsters who would try every trick in the book to avoid having to enlist, it's easy to conclude that the decision Leo Delcroix made, was really worth it's weight in gold.

DBAN2002,3.5,2.5,,,,,"Some people say that in our modern world, dominated by science and technology and industrialisation, there is no longer a place for dreaming and imagination. What is your opinion?","
Cars and trucks rushing by, airplanes flying over, people shouting babies crying, exhaust fumes grabbing you by the throat. People being killed, little children being kidnapped, going to the factory every day, working from nine to life. You get judged by people, you have to wear expensive clothes, you must have a big fast car. Everybody is shouting bigger faster, more.
So who would dare to say that there no longer is a place for dreaming in today's world!? In my opinion dreaming is one of the few ways to escape it all, to leave everything behind. In our Western society where time is money the emphasis should be more on dreaming than on making money. Instead of bookkeeping courses students should be ""taught"" how to dream.
Of course you cannot really teach people how to dream. Love for instance is one of the things that is related to dreaming. When people are in love they are able to leave behind every day life. It is much easier to minimalize problems. Being in love probably is one of the easiest and cheapest means to escape every day life. Love and reaming are not directly related with money. Of course there are exceptions.
When I am working at the production line I am very often thinking about all the things I could possibly buy or do with the money I am earning. Exotic places flash in front of my eyes, of course they are accompanied by beautiful girls and long drinks. These are just a few of the things I am thinking about.
People are dreaming all the time, if people were not dreaming there would be much more crime, a lot more people would get killed etc. If your dreams get materialized step by step you will experience an enormous satisfaction. On the other hand, if they do not get materialized you may be somewhat unhappy.
Some people are very good at stimulating people to dream. For instance artists like painters, musicians story-tellers, writers etc. When you are reading a book it really lifts you out of reality. A painting can really absorb a person, he is sucked into it? Also music can touch the most sensitive chords in a person.
Of course one should never exaggerate, because if you start dreaming excessively you do not keep in touch with reality anymore. This may result in neglecting yourself and your friends and relations. You can dream, but your feet must keep touching the ground.
In these very hysteric times where more and more people are being born into, there will remain less space for us all. So we want to have some more space for ourselves. This space can have a spacious meaning, but it can also have a ""spiritual"" meaning. With this I mean a space you can not measure or see. Some people try to reach this space by taking drugs or other garbage. Some people put very strange devices on their heads to achieve this by means of Virtual Reality, but none of these means can beat an old-fashioned bit of dreaming. So if you want to stay in good physical and mental health, just keep on dreaming!!!

DBAN2005,3.0,3.5,,,,,"In the words of the old song: ""Money is the root of all evil""","
In this essay I would like to talk about the negative aspects of money. Money causes a lot of trouble in the world: robberies, envy, damage to the environment etc.. Also war and politics go together with money. Money is often considered as the key to all doors, but on the other hand we all know the saying: . Let's have a look on its role in society and the negative consequences.
Money plays an important role these days. Even children are already confronted with the value of money. When you ask a child what he or she wants to become when it's grown up, you often get the answer: ""rich"". The importance of money is taught at a very young age and it doesn't leave our mind. Money is also considered to be equal to power. Someone who is rich, is powerful and when you are poor, you have nothing to say. So then you have the problem of classdifferences: upper class with power and lower class with no power. Already in early ages we saw this phenomenon. Money has always been a problem and it always will be. This is a very materialistic world, people think in a very materialistic way and there is nothing you can do about it.
Because of this material world and the importance of money, new problems keep arising. First of all there is robbery.
Everyday, if we have a look in the newspapers, we read about robbery: people who are violently being robbed, banks that get unwanted visitors who want all the money that doesn't belong to them, and also shops are confronted with this problem.
So why do people steal? Easy. Because they don't have any money and money is something you cannot live without. If you want to survive you need money. Of course not only poor people go stealing. A lot of people steal because they are envious or they get a kick by doing it.
Secondly, there is the problem of drugs. We all know that it costs quite a lot of money to buy drugs. Not all the addicts can afford this, so the only solution is robbery. But that's not the only problem. Drugs have one meaning, namely the big chiefs who earn fortunes by selling it. They are only interested in one thing: making as much money as possible and they don't care about all the misery that goes along with it: addicted people, overdoses, family problems etc.. The mere thing they want is to get rich.
Another issue is the environment. Why is the existence of several animals threatened? Easy. Because of money of course. Take the example of the elephants. The only reason why they are slaughtered are the ivory tusks. Ivory is sold for enormous amounts of money. Another example are the seals that are beaten to death because of their fur, which is used for coats and such. Then there are the Japanese who are fervent whale catchers. They don't just eat the whale fish. Some stuff in their brains is used for cosmetics and also ""amber"" in their intestines, is very very expensive. If they keep on hunting, there'll probably be no whale to catch in a couple of years.
But they don't think about that. All these people don't care about the fact that they are destroying nature. They only look at the reward they will get for their efforts, namely -yes- money, lots of money.
There are a number of other areas in which money is involved. Think about kidnapping. Sometimes there's a whole affair involved in a kidnapping case, which is not meant for the public to know about. But the main point is again money, large amounts of money, like in the Anthony De Clerck affair.
Also politics (Agusta affair) and war have to do with this evil thing.
So I don't think you can come up with positive aspects of money. It's easy if you have it, you can buy whatever you want. If people are willing then third world coutries can be given food, material etrc. to survive. But most of these countries are in trouble because of a corrupt government. Look at Mobutu: his people were starving, but he preferred to build an expensive palace or bridge, rather than to feed his country.
In fact you can look at this as a circle: one thing causes another. There's nothing you can do about it, unfortunately. People will always want money. This idea maybe isn't so bad itself, but it is a pity we have to pay a price for it.

DBAN2008,2.5,2.5,2.0,,,,The prison system is outdated. No civilized society should punish its criminals: it should rehabilitate them,"
In most countries the prison system is undergoing a crisis. The increase of criminality, longer punishments, the fact that prisons are short-staffed and the outdated accomodations have led to worrisome conditions. Prisons have to cope with an overpopulation. To some extent the alarming increase of the prisoners is due to the increase of criminality in the last few years: from traffic offences and shoplifting to robbery. But also the unemployment, the nonymity in society, the urbanization and the post-war baby boom can serve as an explanation for this overpopulation. Besides this overpopulation there are complaints about the lack of protection among prisoners: criminal assaults and physical violence are of the order of the day. Prisoners are sometimes even forced to take drugs. The conditions in which detainees have to live are below the mark. A big problem in the outdated prisons are the primitive sanitary facilities.
It occurs only too often that prisoners have to share 'one' shower. The overpopulation and the hygienic conditions lead to frustrations and agression among the prisoners. It is said that the situation in prisons is medieval but for the time being there is no money for adequate reforms. More attention should be paid on the construction of new prisons, the formation of regional criminal information services.
The training of police forces should be improved in future and more money should be spent on projects that will deal chiefly with the prevention of crimes. It needs to be said that in too many cases harsh measures are taken while little attention is paid on the prevention of crimes.
According to me, too many people are wrongly put in prison. I'm referring to mentally disturbed people, junkies and alcoholics, who did commit a crime, but to whom a medical treatment would prove more helpful rather than an imprisonment.
Besides, it would be cheaper for the government as a prisoner costs about 20,000 francs a week, while a treatment under public health service would amount to some 7,000 francs.
I'm convinced that the existing problems of society such as drug traffic, illegal gambling, prostitution, traffic in women or fraude cannot be resolved by putting people in prison.
I believe prisons only lead to a higher degree of criminality. It is stated that more than three quarters of the condemned and imprisoned people repeat the offence as they come out of jail. I'm of the opinion that people don't get ""better"" by being imprisoned for a certain time.
As far as that is concerned, the possibilities in the penal code are too limited: there is a lack of creativity.
The penal code should be made more human because there are a lot of snags attached to the deprivation of freedom and the high fines. Besides, it is unuseful to impose high fines, because the majority of the condemned people are not exactly rich and usually have a low income.
The unfavourable side effects of imprisonment are: broken marriages, loss of jobs, ...etc.
For yound delinquents, the situation is different but even more serious.
They are often marked as criminals for life and not accepted by the society. This means they risk to end up in the criminal environment again. As a rule, imprisonment doesn't help. It is indeed an illusion to think that a detainee generally becomes 'better'.
I, for may part, think it would be a good solution to introduce 'alternative sanctions', in form of a service. This way, the criminal offence is repayed from another point of view. If someone did harm, he will have to make it up with the society. The services and jobs should be gone about in an educationally responsible fashion. The delinquents should be employed in hospitals, in homes for the elderly, in animal shelters... By working they would repay the harm they've done but they would also do something for the society they live in.
In my opinion, these alternative sanctions are very useful because they would give the delinquents a sense of appreciation and that is exactly what they need. Another possibility is to let the delinquent work for the dupe. This can favourably because this way the delinquent is confronted by the crime he has commited. I'm sure that by introducing these alternative sanctions the amount of recidivists will decline. The aim is to prevent recurrence and if we can obtain this by alternative sanctions, society will gain by this.

Some people say that in our modern world, dominated by science technology and industrialisation, there is no longer a place for dreaming and imagination. Have we really reached the end? Have all our dreams come true, which would mean: is this the end of the world? Does everything stop here? There must be some people left who have not stopped dreaming!
Of course we cannot dream of the first man on the moon anymore. People who said we would go to the moon used to be called dreamers, and today, there are still dreamers left. Why could we not say we will go to Mars or Pluto or Venus? Are the people who say such things not dreamers too?
Science technology and dustrialisation have gone far. So far that things sometimes have become too complex for man to understand. But as the world becomes complex, so do our dreams. man has made so much things he dreamt of possible. He was the one who invented nuclear plants, he was the one who developed genetic engineering. So it is almost certainly he will also be the one to realise further progress and further advancement. There is so much still to be invented: a machine to go back in time or a house on the moon we could live in or... Many people are dreaming of such things.
But sometimes you haven't got that far to look. Science technology and dustrialisation may have gone too far. So far that wars came into being. Nuclear weapons and long-range-missiles are also today's inventions. Think about the casualties of war. Their mothers and fathers imagine that these weapons would never have existed; they imagine that their sons are still alive.
There are even some things we have been dreaming of since we were born. Man has for instance dreamt of being able to fly since time memorial. At one ponit in history he invented the plane. Hundreds of types of planes have been developed: from biplanes to gliders, from pleasure aircraft to supersonice airliners. But man was not satisfied yet. He dreamt of having the feeling of flying on his own, without any machine that surrounded him. So he tried Benji-jumping. Jumping while he was protected only by an elastic. And now some of us are even dreaming of being Peter Pan. We could already see that in the film ""Mr. Jones"", in which Richard ""Mr. Jones"" Gere is goiong to jump off a rooftop several times.
Today's singer-songwriters express man's wishes and dreams. A big part of music culture is about dreaming and imagination. The Simple Minds (""Belfast Child""), USA for Africa (""We are the world""), U2 (""Sunday Bloody Sunday""), Sinead O'Connor (Black Boys on Mopeds"") are a few rocksingers who protest against the oppression of human beings, against war, against racism and fascism, against all the terrible evils of the world. They are dreaming of a better world, a better place to live. They hope they reach the ears and eyes of all the youn and older people of the whole world, and they hope especially to reach their hearts and minds. They try to stimulate people to dream of and imagine this better world, in order to realise it.
There are lots of other examples which prove the fact that there is still a place for dreaming and imagination in our modern world. Without the dreaming and imagination, we would not have the energy to stay alive. There would be nothing left to live for.

There is a beer map which states: . Of course this is meant jokingly, but some do not realize how true this is. There are nursery schools where the teachers have to show the four-year-old toddlers how to work with a computer. Has our schoolsystem gone this mad that, already in nursery school, they have to prepare the children for their future jobs, whatever they might be? There is less time to play and to have fun, because their heads have to be filled with computer-knowledge.
Some say that in this scientific and technological world there is no longer room for dreaming and imagination. If you loddk at the example above they seem to be right. But science and technology will never be able to substitute dreaming and imagination. Who does not think about his/her next Christmas, his/her next summerholiday, his/her girl- or boyfriend. I could continue this list endlessly. All this thinking is made possible thanks to our imagination. We expect a lot from the future and we dream about it, we can imagine different situations concerning the future. But also the past is subject of our imagination. We can dream and do dream about a holiday we had, about a party we went to last year, about something that happened in school a few years ago,... Again this list is endless. If there would not be dreams and imagination, people would not be able to think about what they ever experienced and what they hope to experience once!
Another domain where people use their imagination is their head were they make all kinds of associations: While you are waiting for the bus or when your are writing an essay, you make associations. For example when you write something about your holiday, you think of your last holiday. While you are thinking of these fine, sunny days you remember something that happened when you were planning your holiday. You think of a friend you met at that time and who you promised to write, but suddenly you realize you still have not written to him/her. In this way the thinking continues. Most of it actually happens without you realizing it. Only some parts are really experienced. I would say it is dreaming while you are awake or it is daydreaming. With this difference that with daydreaming, most of the time you know what you are thinking about. I say this is all imagination. Imagination not in the sence of something you thought you had seen or heard ('It is only your imagination'). Here imagination means dreaming of something that was, that is or maybe that will be. Dreaming and imagination are inter-changable here. Again we would be nothing if dreaming and imagination disappeared. Everything in live is ""contaminated"" with dreaming and imagination.
Also technology, which is said to dominate our mind more and more, is not free of imagination itself. When you can draw very well, it is sometimes called art. Today it is possible to draw with a computer, but without imagination there would not be art, there would not even be technology. Because people could think and people could use their imagination, they could make technology.
All these examples are given to say that it would be impossible to live without imagination. Only when people will be brainwashed or when they will be given computermemories they will stop dreaming. But we are always free to think so we will always be free to dream!!!

DBAN2018,3.0,3.5,,,,,The prison system is outdated. No civilized society should punish its criminals: it should rehabilitate them,"
Quite a few people think that criminals do not deserve a better treatment than being locked up in a prison. I agree that the other citizens should be protected from those who commit crimes, but according to me, the present prison system is not efficient.
I have 4 reasons to have that opinion: Firs of allI think the present prison system is far too expensive. All the prisoners have to eat, to be dressed,... which costs money of course. But not only that: all the people working in the prisons (wards, maintenance staff,...) have to be paid a salary too. All this money comes from us, tax-payers, which is really unfair.
The prisons (especially in Belgium) are overcrowded. So, all those criminals are sandwiched together. Some examples: illegal foreigners are mixed with heavy criminals like murderers, sometimes 4 people have to live in a cell that is only made for 2. All this makes the prisoners even more unhappy with their situation. I think it is normal they start to lay plans with fellow-criminals (not too hard to find them, I reckon!) to escape or commit other crimes.
The prisoners do not have a thing to look forward to, the only aim left in life for them is there release. I think they should be given an occupation, something in which they can prove themselves, be creative.
When they are finally allowed to leave prison the prisoners are not prepared for the real world. They probably do not have any money, no house, friends, no job left. Moreover, it is very difficult for them to get these things back. Employers are not very keen to take on ex-prisoners, especially not in these days of high unemployment. This means they cannot rn money, and so the seduction to start stealing again is large. The release is too sudden I think.
Some people will see execution as a solution but my opinion is that this is narrow-minded.
My proposal is to create a kind of ""prisoners-community"". I know it is very idealistic, but with a lot of effort and thinking it must be realizable. We should give the prisoners a number of square miles and fence it off very well. Within that enclosed area they would be able to walk around freely, each of them having a certain task. First, factories should be built to produce the goods they need. There should be fields with all kinds of crops, cultivated by prisoners of course, and animals for meat and manure. Of course, there should be staff to keep an eye on them too, but this would be a lot less then there is now. This system would enable the prisoners to provide almost entirely in their own needs which would solve the financial problem. There would be plenty of space for them to walk around, which would give them more privacy.
The working in factories, on land, ... would give them an aim. This ""community-system"" would in a way be simular to the real world, which would make it much easier to adapt after their release. I think that after a while, prisoners would be regarded differently by the outside world and maybe they would be given a chance again.

DBAN2019,4.0,3.5,,,,,"In his novel ""Animal Farm"" George Orwell wrote ""All men are equal but some are more equal than others"". How true is this today?","
The statement  still is and will always be true. A society where this is not true, is a utopia. It is a fact that there have been attempts to make a society where all men are really equal, the best known one was communism. After a while all the attempts turned out to have A weakness, men! Theoreticaly almost all of the possibilities seemed possible, but when men interfered he always ended up trying to improve his personal status, this always lead to the fall of every idealistic community where all men should be equal!
In our society all men are equal according to the law, but as 'Napoleon' said some of us seem to be more equal than the rest of us. This is inevitable, it is part of human nature. Ever since slavery was abolished all men became equal, nevertheless our political system states that a small group of people, who were chosen by the people and called politicians, have to make sure everything goes as it should. This means that they get more power than the rest of the us. When somebody gets power, it is not unusual that that person will try to use it for his or her own benefit. The result is that those people will be able to do more than other people, so we could say that they are more equal than there fellow countrymen. It is not fair to say that all politicians are like that, but I wouldn't be lying if I said that the majority of them once in a while takes advantage of there power.
Next to politicians there is another group of people who seem to be more equal than the others, this group is the group of the rich and famous. The power of the media is enormous and the people who can use this power are the ones that are part of or own part of that media. Famous people became famous because a lot of people got interested in something they do or are, as a result they are in the focus. There are a lot of disadvantages to that (cfr. Lady Diana...), but it also is a situation that can give you a lot of power. Every idea they utter is accepted by at least a small group, even when it is very controversial (cfr. Madonna). The more successful on is or the more money someone has, the more people they can reach and influence. As a result they get a lot of power. The best example for this are the presidential elections in the U.S.A., these are won by the most popular guy with the best T.V.-campaign.
It think I can conclude that the statement  is very true in our world. I also think it is a pitty it has to be like that but it is part of capitalism, as I already explained the attemps to change this didn't work out and I don't think any of them ever will. To put it black or white, we have to choose between the world of ""1984"" (by George Orwell) and the ""American way of life"", this means there is a lot of very rich people but there also is a lot of poverty. I can't help it but in this case I have to join the public opinion and choose for the ""American way"". To prevent every misunderstanding, I refered to ""1984"" because, as Orwell did, I think that is the only way communism can work. If you consider everything, you can state that the 'perfect' world, where all men are really equal, can't exist because the flesh is weak!!

DBAN2020,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,"In the words of the old song: ""Money is the root of all evil""","
The status of money has gone through an evolution since it's origin. Money used to be an exclusive means of exchange. But in present days, money has a different dimension. Money can be situated on different levels and therefore I'd like to mention the theory of Emmanel Levinas.
Money is in the first place an efficient means. It gives us the opportunity to live in a fairly wealthy situation. Money brings about human relations f.i. the relationship between an employer and an employee. Money has an important role in this relationship. Money is therefore of great economic value.
Money can be a way to become important for someone. For instance, parents give their children the opportunity to develop their personal talents by financing their studies. In this way a relationship of mutual respect is created.
Money can be used to act fairly. For instance, we can help people in emergency situations by depositing money. But a lot of people are suspicious of these initiatives because they aren't sure if the money will come in the right hands and because they don't benefit from it themselves.
Although money can be very useful, it often leads to situations where the role of money becomes increasingly important.
The present economiy is achievemtn-oriented and profit making: ""Time is money"".
Companies try to increase their productivity and their profits and people are implicitly forced to high achievements. Stress situations are not excluded. In this competitive climate people are often not regarded as a personality but rather as a number f.i. in factories. Companies should ask themselves if this is ethically sound.
The competitive nature has had a negative influence on the environment as well. Companies want to increase their production by reclaiming more and more raw materials. That's why the amount of raw materials has decreased drastically the last few years.
I'd also like to mention deforestation. Woody areas are being destroyed in order to make place for profit making initiatives. We live in a consumer society and peole are even prepared to give up their free time in order to live up to the high living standards that the society has created. This often l eads to tentions in the family, divorces etc.
People are divided in different classes because of their possession of money. We can find this in the judiciaryy system. A class justice is created. Rich people can afford adequate lawyers contrary to poor people. Jusice is often being questioned in these situations. But money also plays an important role here f.i. the compensation of material damage.
The change of the value of money has been caused by human himself. He is in general pragmatic: ""nothing for nothing"".
I'm sure other misuses of money can be listed (bribery, extortion...)
One can't deny that the possession of money is easy and necessary to survive, but at the same time money can be easily misused and some people will even state that money is the root of all evil.

DBAN2022,3.0,4.0,2.5,2.5,2.0,3.5,The prison system is outdated. No civilized society should punish its criminals: it should rehabilitate them,"
Nowadays, we can read more and more in papers and magazines about crimes that are committed by juvenile delinquents. After committing a crime, they get caught and they end up in prisons, the so called ""closed penintentiaries"", for a period of three months. These three months are the maximum period of stay because juvenile delinquents may not be imprisoned for a period longer than three months. But what happens with them after this? Where do they then end up?
Only a few delinquents can go back home and live with their parents. But most of them have to leave the penintentiary and they do not have a further place to stay. Sometimes, they are put in severe boarding schools to reeducate them. Then, a new problem arises because the rules are less severe than in the penintentiaries, which results in a transition that is too big and they fall back in their old habits of crime again. Moreover, when they are of age they have to leave the boarding schools anyway and then they will be confronted with a society they have never taken part in.
Another problem is that juvenile delinquents often have had less or no education and because of that, they are not able to find a job. But off course, they need money, all people need money to survive. The answer to this problem is simple: go back to crime again.
Even if they are able to get a job, they are given a coldshoulder just because of their criminal past. Society does not accept them, which causes isolation and loneliness. Therefore, they search for other methods to replace social contacts such as drugs, prostitution, theft etc. In other words, their old habits.
Through here, there will never be a real future for them, they are not given the opportunity to make up for their mistakes they made in their youth. So society is still punishing them. This is very unfair because they have already been punished by means of imprisonment. It certainly does not have to be this way but what can there be done to help them?
First of all, the already existing rehabilitation programms have to be revised. They have to be adapted more to the contemporary society. They should help the ex-delinquents to adapt to the society they live in, teach them social skills so that they will not become isolated. These programms will also have to provide in education and employment.
This is not all there can be done. Not only the rehabilitation programms have to be revised, also society itself needs to change. People have to get rid of their prejudices and give them a fair chance. Ex-delinquents must be able to prove that they have learned from their mistakes, they simply deserve a second chance.
If this does not happen, then criminality will increase indeed because there will no other alternatives they can turn to, they will go back to the criminal world. Through this, society will become more and more prejudiced, rehabilitation programms will not work out the way they should and the delinquents will reach the impasse of: ""Once a criminal, always a criminal.""

Some people say that in our modern world, dominated by science, technology and industrialisation, there is no longer a place for dreaming and imagination. However, I do not agree with this statement.
Everybody has got dreams. What would we be without them? Life is one big dream. This may sound a bit naive, but I do not think so. Eventhough we are living in a high-tech world where everything is developping rapidly, where new inventions and scientific breakthroughs are daily news, it is impossible that this will keep us from dreaming. A man who loses his dreams, loses a part of his life.
You have to have dreams, dreams about yourself, about your future, about the world's future. Dreaming is typical of the human nature. There would be not one single song, not one single book, film, work of art, poem,etc. if man had lost his dreams and imagination. so much of what you say and do, is part of a dream you have, a dream to create something, to do something useful.
Most of the time, when people say that their dream is to have lots of money, this is not a real dream. It is just the greedy side of human nature, but it is no dream. Money can be useful, but it is certainly not a condition to be happy. Unfortunately, many people think otherwise. How many ideals, how many dreams have not been betrayed for money?
A man defends the rainforest because it is his dream to keep it preserved. But then he sees how much money is being made i nthe business of chopping down the trees, of destroying the forest. He forgets about his dream because life will become so much easier now that he will earn a lot of money. But he makes a huge mistake because you cannot buy nature, you cannot buy love, friendship, health, tenderness, and you certainly cannot buy dreams. As a child, you dram of toys, of becoming a nurse or a policeman, of getting nice presents for your birthday. When you get older, these dreams change too. Other things become important, like friends, school, work. But although your dreams change, you will still try to fulfil them. All your life you will search for the one thing you have always dreamt of.We are all chasing our dreams. We might never be able to realize them, but most important is that we keep them alive. To escape from the real world for a while, you have to think of your dreams. In situations when yuou are desperate, when there seems to be no way out, maybe, one day, if you think of your dreams again, you will regain hope.
My friend was someone who had one big dream: he wanted to become a pilot. He studied day and night and was doing great. But one day he got ill. After several tests it was shown that he had cancer. He went to chemotherapy and saw more hospitals in one year than a man does in his entire life. He fought hard, because he had a dream: joining the airforce.
After a year, we were told that the cancer had spread. The doctors already had given up on him, but he kept on fighting, although all the odds were against him. He suffered a lot and knew he was going to die, but he never gave up hoping that one day he would fly. The last words he spoke to me before he died, were . He had finally found his dream...

Since the world started to change under the rise of science technology and industrialisation, people's lifes became busier and busier. There are people who are able to stand up to all this, to this life-style that has become a hectic and a nervous one, but there are also people who do not, people who can not keep up with this way of life. They are called the losers, the softies, who can not follow the world's increasing materialisation and industrialisation. A lot of people nowadays suffer under stress and all kind of weird diseases as a result to this life-style. The situation gets even that bad, that also personal relationships, family-life and dreaming and imagination are being neglected. People no longer have the time or place to have a breathing spell, to catch up with the ones they love and have some time to their own. A way of reacting against this can be learning to live with it and letting things go the way they go. Another possible reaction is that you realize that it can not go on this way and that you try to change things, to create some personal, intimate moments yourself, that no one can take away from you. You need those moments of rest and that is all there is to it. A third reaction, a drastic one, is that you decide that you can no longer live in a world like this and that you do not see a way out, or that you do not feel like changing the situation yourself, that you want ""to opt out"" of this system, and commit suicide. That is what some people do who are very emotional and sensitive and who feel that this world has nothing to offer to them any more or can no longer interest them. This can happen to, for example, poets or artists. Then of course, there are also people like you and I, who try to fight their way out of it and who want to take that time for dreams, imagination and coming to theirselves, no matter what. It is just a case of finding the golden mean between on the one hand all that work you have there lying waiting for you, all those tasks to be done in time, and on the other hand still being able to enjoy your social life, your love life and your own personal world of dreams and imagination. If you can manage to take all those things into consideration, you just might be one of the lucky ones who end up living a happy life.

DBAN2029,3.0,,,,,,Crime does not pay,"
Crime has always existed and probably always will. Crime was born when men was born, but crime probably became much more violent the last couple of decades.
In the early days crime was punished severely. If a man stole some food, his hand was chopped off. They did not consider the fact that this man could have been very poor and had to support a big family. Crime was not something you could get away with: whenever they could prove you were guilty or even when they just thought you were, you got punished. Lots knew that they probably would get caught, but at that moment it was their only choice: they could steal or starve.
Nowadays the situation has changed a lot. There are lots of criminals who still walk freely on the streets, although everybody knows they are guilty.
The mob for instance is a very good example. This organization, with a lot of members, has much influence on our society, especially in countries like Italy, although we should not underestimate their influence on the entire world. They already killed hundreds, maybe thousands of people often for very small faults or silly reasons. They are also involved in all kinds of illegal business, but nobody seems to be able to arrest them and bring them to court. One way or another they always get away with it: when they are in prison they can escape or when there is a trial there are always some mistakes made and that way they have to be let free. Then they can go on doing the things they were doing. For such organizations crime does pay off, because they do profitable illegal business without punishments.
Crime though is not always on a large scale. There are several criminals who work in small groups or all alone. These people very often only commit smaller offences, but usually they are punished severely.
The police usually does not have any difficulty in arresting these small criminals, but they do not seem to be able to arrest larger organizations. those large organizations often have a certain power over the police and often policemen are being threatened.
The judiciary system is not always fair when they deal with crime. It is very hard to arrest a big criminal and it usually takes months of preparations, but many criminals seem to get out very quickly again. A lot of procedural mistakes are made, but does that not sometimes happen on purpose? It is known that some lawyers and judges accept money for freedom. This of course is something that only larger criminals can do, because the others do not have enough money. Smaller criminals are also very often punished too severe, maybe just to fool people: to show them that not every criminal can do whatever he likes.
It also very often happens that the police can only catch the smaller elements of large organizations and that way the big bosses can very easily continue their business. If on the other hand one of the major persons is arrested it sometimes becomes difficult for the organization. It is only by arresting these people that the police is able to shut down a whole organisation, but that is just the problem: it takes a lots of time and a lot of work to catch a large criminal and it is even more difficult to keep him in prison.
Therefore it seems that crime does not pay off if you are just a small criminal, but for a large criminal crime can very often mean very good business.

George Orwell was a very wise man to write this sentence. As far as I can remember there have always been people more equal than others. In fact, we are brought up with this point of view.
I can remember the years I spent in elementory school.
Teachers always had a favourite and unfortunately that one wasn't me. I could become very angry to see how a child was given preferential treatment just because they sange better than you did, or because they were potty trained while all you could think off was how to get on the damn toilet. Sometimes you didn't even had to go to school. I think a lot of children found out that their baby sister or their big brother was favoured although parents, in theory, have to be the most objective people in the world.
This continues when you have grown up. Suppose that you graduated together with your best friend. You both have good marks, and maybe yours are even better. You decide to apply for the same job and deep down inside you know that you are more qualified than your friend. But, you don't get the job because your friend knows someone in that company.
Another thing: if everyone is regarded equal, than how is it possible that your neighbour drives an expensive car and you only have a 2CV? Because he is equal? No, because people made him different in status!
Another good example I could find is the one that carries the name 'politics'. The constitution sais that all men are to be regarded as equal. But where does this equality shows? It is enough to look at the government. The king isn't appointed, he was born king. Doesn't he have to study to achieve something in life? If people keep laying stress on good education and on a diploma, than why is it that our ministers don't have to have a diploma? they have to govern our country with all the responsibilities. Is this what equality means? Also the election system shows something quite different. That showed during the last elections. Poeple voted on a massive scale for one party, but two months later people are demonstrating against that party. Is this equality? I get the idea that not all the political parties are treated in the same way. Why can one party come and talk on television, while another one can't? Because of equality!
And as all good writers do, I have tried to save the best for last and I don't think this will make me equal. I think that the Indians and the Blacks are the best example of what equality isn't! By this I especially mean the Indians and Blacks in America. They were promised to get the same rights as white men, they were promised that they would get equal and the contitution also states this. But in their struggle for equality they have made little progress. The Indians have become a rare species and the Blacks are still living in poor neighbourhoods. I think they will never get what they deserve and as far as I am concerned there is not better example to show that equality only reigns among those people who don't need it anymore. Normal people like you and me will always have hard times to get what they deserve.

DBAN2031,3.0,2.5,,,,,All armies should consist entirely of professional soldiers: there is no value in a system of military service,"
At first sight, it may seem a bit strange that a girls writes an essay about the military service and the army, because some may think that I don't know what I'm talking about since I don't have to join in the army. But maybe, just maybe, this way, I can be more objective.
I totally agree with the statement above: that the army should consist entirely of professional soldiers. Why, you may ask.
Well, to give you an example, that stands for an argument I think: a couple of weeks ago I met two Greek boys. Both of them are about twenty-three, I guess. We were talking about greece and all and about their studies and one of them said that he wanted to study as long as possible because he wanted to delay his going into the army. And when he told me that the military service overthere lasts two (TWO!) years, (so did it overhere until some decades ago, by the way, but still ...) I could fully understand his reasoning. Now, tell me, is there anything good about military service, when young men are not at all interested in fighting. Now I think about it, there should be more of those youngsters. When those people enter i the army and they have to do very tough, difficult and exhausting exercises, they will only get frustrated and they will began to curse everything and everyone and this will lead to more and more tensions. Because that is what happens when you do not agree 100% with it.
Another example, or argument rather. When, in thimes of war, the government decides to interfere in a foreign battle and ALL ministers totally agree on the fact that they should interfere, I doubt it whether the citizens agree too. Maybe some of them, but those are the ones that do not have to go into wart, litterally I mean, as a soldier of war. I do not think there is one single person who says: Well, yes, for one of those foreign countries I want to leave my house, my family, my friends and risk my life; and all this for people that I don't even know and what's more I am even prepared to kill people that I don't even know. Because, how can one tell whether A is a good man/woman and B is a bad one. The ordinary citizens of those foreign countries can not help it that their respectative governments just happen to disagree on this or that point.
But, opposite to the people who rather do no go into the army, we also have to take a closer look at those who voluntarily sign up and dream of a career as a professional militair.
I know that there are also advantages of the military service; not that many I think, but anyway...
When you go into the army, you are totally independent, you have to do everything on your own. This way, you get a pretty big sense of responsibility.
When the soldiers are on the 'battlefields', doing exercises, they are not only responsible for their own lives, but also for the lives of others. Every move they make can make a hell of a difference. You can either kill or save one of your buddies.
When you are in the army you also learn to obey orders of superiors. this can either turn out positively, in that way that later on when you are working, you will also have to obey the orders of your boss. But, as I have already said before, it can also turn out negatively. The soldiers can bottle up their resentments against the whole system and sooner or later they might 'burst'.
So, I don't think that it is very useful for a country to have an army. This may sound sily, but what is the use of an army when country A has 50,000 soldiers and country B only has 25,000? Guess who will win?! The answer is not that difficult, is it?
What I do think is useful, is the army of the United Nations, since they only consist of soldiers who have chosen to dedicate their lives for the safety of others. I am very sorry for those brave men who die and for their families, but they knew from the beginning which risks there were.

DBAN2032,2.5,2.5,,,,,Most university degrees are theoretical and do not prepare students for the real world. They are therefore of very little value,"
In Belgium, we have to make a distinction between university and HOBU (higher education on academic level). The difference between these two is the HOBU is a bit more practical. Still, a lot of theory is taught to get a wide knowledge of the world. When you want to become an interpreter, for example, you go to HOBU. You have to make a lot of translations; this is the practical side. But you also get a lot of theoretical courses, for example, linguistics, philosophy, psychology, sociology... The problem today is, especially for university students, that they only have had theoretical courses. They have a big knowledge but they did not get on-the-job training. They do not know how to use their knowledge in practice.
But why is this such a big proglem?
Well, nowadays, employers always want to engage someone with an adequate certificate. But more important is that the applicant has experience. He should have worked, for example, in the same kind of company before, or he should at least have done a work placement in the same branch.
For those who graduated as a teacher or those who have studied German or Ramance Philology it is not such a big problem because they are obliged to do a teaching practice.
for the others, on the other hand, who just graduated, it is very difficult to find a job. there is a lot of unemployment and people who are experienced, often older people, are favoured. That is why I think that university degrees are a bit useless. (but not at all of very little value). It is the experience that counts.
What can we do about it?
Universities and colleges (HOBU) should give their students the possibility to do a work placement but only for those who are interested. It should not be obligatory. In that way the students could do that work placement and write a report about it. And maybe they could write a thesis about that term of probation. If they are looking for a job later, they would not have many problems because they have experience. It is even possible that they can stay with the company they have worked with. Besides, it would also be a good thing for companies because they do not have to pay these workforces. I think this would be a much better kind of instruction than writing a pure theoretical thesis. We must though not neglect theoretical instruction. Practice and theory should go side by side.

How sad but true this is! Money and power, science technology and economy, industrialisation and education are the things that really matter in our society. Nowadays dreaming and imagination are becoming more and more second-rate. Our priorities seem to have gone through some changes.
Power, money, technology... are the criteria for 'success' in life and for just being heard and respected. Without success you are nothing in this society. what is striking is, that we seem to have forgotten what it means to be truly happy. We confuse success with happiness. No doubt happiness cannot possibly be obtained without dreams and imagination, without feelings and emotions. Nowadays everything is insensitive, cold, unfeeling..., which is a big problem in our society. There is this fight for survival, everybody on its own in the big bad world. Feelings are inconvenient, superfluous in all aspects of life. They are considered to be the 'things' that hold you back. This is especially the case in business, which is no doubt a dominant factor in our society. 'Business is business' has become a common notion. There is no place for compation, charity, the same way that there is no place for dreaming and imagination. It all boils down to making a profit, productivity, accomplishment.
There is also a lack of time for dreaming, imagination and plain creativity. Our days are carefully planned and more than filled (the rush of daily life). Sure, we still dream but almost only at night, unconscious of it. by the time we have woken up we have forgotten all about it. It does not interest us anymore, we have other things on our minds like work, school, appointments...money, money, money. People get caught in this mill of things and do not see any way out.
Imagination and dreaming are a form of freedom where natural boundaries are exceeded. In our imagination we bare our souls, either conscious or not, with its desires, fears and creative possibilities. Imaginaiton is an introspective tool. We are in a world then where our minds take a broad sweep, where it is not relevant whether or not something is realised, or if problems are solved or created. Imagination is also not something we can force upon ourselves. But it is a necessity for humans to be whole. It is one of the things that distinguishes us from other living creatures.
The negligence of the importance of dreaming and imagination is prevalent at all ages. Even toys nowadays do not leave much to imagination. The more complicated, artificial (supplied with technical devices) the better. Children do not really play anymore. They are no longer creative. They are handed these 'revolutionary' toys or just put in front of the television in order to keep them busy. This is very passive without the development of the personality or the mind.
People in general spend a considerable amount of time watching TV, which is at the expense of other leisure activities. It has also been proven that TV steals time which would otherwise have been spend on imagination. TV is an 'easy' medium which requires little mental effort. This leads to a passive 'let you entertain me'-attitude which undermines the willingness to think something up ourselves. TV also undermines the ability to focus your attention on something for quite a long time, which is needed for imagination. TV leads to over-excitement, impulsive thinking, a reduction of attention and restless behaviour. This is also determined by the kind of programmes we watch. 'Kind' programmes leave our imagination undisturbed. Programmes with much violence and action, however, are adverse on our imagination.
It is really a shame, that we seem to choose for a life without imagination or dreaming. Is happiness not to be found in our minds and hearts rather than in material things, our bank account...? Chateaubriand once said that true happiness is to be found in little things, that if it costs much it is not of the right kind. Our priorities and values in life have changed. We need scientific arguments, proof before we believe in something. We are all very much involved in trying to make something of our lives without really living, experiencing it. We do not seem to care about dreaming and imagination because we believe that it does not provide us with something. Or is this my 'imagination'?

DBAN2034,2.5,2.5,2.0,,,,"In the words of the old song: ""Money is the root of all evil""","
Nowadays, it seems as if money is the most important thing on earth. A lot of people already have a full-time job, but they still go out working in the evenings. And all for one reason: money.
People have become too materialistic anyway. I certainly have to admit that it can be handy to be rich: you can buy everything you want; washing machines, dishwashers, CD-players, video's, cars, or what so ever.
But if you ask me, money isn't the key to happiness at all. I think money offers you more dis- than advantages.
If you become rich, the danger exists that you become more and more egostic. But another problem is that rich people can become extremely powerful, especially because they can afford everything. An example of this was Saddam Houssein, the offender of the Gulf War. That man was so rich, that he even didn't know how much he possessed. But because of his large amounts of money, he was able to put pressure on the whole world and he was frightened by everybody. So, you see: money is the root of all evil.
It also has to be very difficult to have a relation, if you are rich. You always have to wonder whether your partner loves you or just your money. And who are your real friends? You always have to doubt about this sorts of things. Other persons may also have this problem, but money certainly makes things more complicated.
Rich people often want more and more money. They would do anything to become richer.
Therefore, it doesn't have to surprise you that riche people can become criminals. they betray other people and even grow richer. I think it is very dreadful that a lot of people don't see the little but so beautiful things in life anymore. They don't see the flowers and the trees and the bees anymore. They are only occupied with themselves.
And what's far more terrible, is that those rich people are respected by the others. They believe that those people have to know a lot, because they are that rich. Well, they are wrong. Cleverness doesn't have anything to do with money at all. Although those rich ones also know this, they often discriminate other people. Sometimes, they behave like they were God.
So far, I have described the rich people as egostic. But this certainly doesn't mean that this is a general statement.
Rich people, who want to share their money with others; people, who want to give money to charity funds or what so ever... Well, they are OK. You may have lots of money, as long as you stay simple, you're on the good way.
But I wouldn't like to be in the place of these people either. Having a lot of money also has its consequences.
It isn't the first time, a rich man is kidnapped. You also have to be more frightened on the street. Because people are able to see whether you are rich or not.
For all these reasons, I believe, it's much better to stay simple. If you ask me, you'll enjoy life much more!!!!!

DBAN2036,3.5,4.0,,,,,"Some people say that in our modern world, dominated by science and technology and industrialisation, there is no longer a place for dreaming and imagination. What is your opinion?","
I interpreted this sentence as romantic pessimism. In my opinion it can be understood in two ways, both which I will explain.
Firstly, the sentence could be read as following: ""... there is no longer a place for the products of dreaming and imagination"". Because of science technology and industrialisation, everything was put into a pigeonhole. Every object received a clear definition for example nowadays we know that water consists of H20, that it boils at 100?C and that it frezzes at 0?C. The people of the Middle Ages, so before science technology and industrialisation, did not know this, so they saw the boiling and freezing as a magical experience. In our world, we know exactly what water is capable of doing, so there is less room for fantasy while in earlier times people did not know so much about a lot of things, so there was more room for fantasy. We can say that objects nowadays do not give cause to fantasize as much about them as they must have done before Modern Times.
But I ask myself, and this is about the second interpretation of the sentence, whether this phenomenon results in that people actually fantasize or dream less. So now I amtalking about whether there is no longer place for the act of dreaming and imagination. It is hard to compare how much people before Modern Times or people after industrialisation dreamt and fantasized. What can obviously be stated is that people still dream and fantasize. But maybe there is a difference between now and the past. It can be found in the situation people lived in. Because of science technology and industrialisation, our society is divided into two atmospheres: daily life and private life. In daily life there is no place for dreaming and imagination i.e. for fantasy. As a result there is a strong tendency for escapism. So imagination and dreaming become part of the private atmosphere, of ther leisure time; people use it to enjoy theirselves. In the Middle Ages dreaming and imagination were part of dailylife, of reality. So we can notice a shift from daily life to private life all because of science technology and industrialisation.
Shortly, it can be said that my opinion about the sentence depends on the interpretation. When it means ""...there is no longer place for the products of dreaming and imagination"", I think that society today gives less cause to fantasize and dream because of the scientific approach of the objects. When the sentence means ""...there is no longer place for the act of dreaming and imagination"", I can say that a division has arisen between reality and private life, while before Modern Times this separation did not exist. Dreaming and imagination have thus made a shift from reality to the private atmosphere.

DBAN2039,3.0,,,,,,The prison system is outdated. No civilized society should punish its criminals: it should rehabilitate them,"
The prison system is indeed outdated, but at the root of all problems lies the court of justice. The prison population is rising everywhere, due to an arbitrary administration of justice. Overcrowded prisons and pathetic hygiene painly manifest the outdated prison system.
The phenomenon of overcrowded prisons is found all over the world, and in some countries, the situation is really poignant. This overcrowding leads to an increasing aggression and violence among prisoners, as they even have less room to move than would be the case in normal circumstances.
Prisoners then go on strike, because of these degrading living conditions, or even worse, start a riot, which often ends with some prisoners getting killed. when prisoners complain about these worse conditions, they are silenced by guards, who feel they are being provoked or who think the prisoners are starting a riot. In most cases, the prisoners only ask for an objective evaluation of their situation. The prisoners consequently feel ignored most of the times. A better social system, that handles the prisoner's complaints, should be set up in order to reduce the distance between prisoners and the authorities.
The authorities do not always have to take legal action against criminals. An alternative is to rehabilitate them. I partly agree with the statement that . Whether or not a society should punish a criminal, is largely dependent on the severity of the offence. By way of example, I would like to elaborate the drug problem.
There are several reasons why it is inexcusable that drug addicts are sentenced to imprisonment. For one, drug addicts have already built an artificial wall around them in the outside world. A stay in prison will often completely isolate these people, who then sometimes commit suicide in a fit of desperation. Another reason is that these people are still confronted with drugs in prison. In some countries, the supply of drugs to prisons is simply alarming. In this respect, the argumentation of government that drugs disappears from the street-scape by putting drug addicts behind bars, is simplistic and ludicrous. The outlet of drugs is simply moved to prison and the situation will eventually escalate.
In order to avoid an escalation, drug addicts have to be sent to a drug rehabilitation centre, where professional people will encourage them to make a new beginning in their life. This method of rehabilitating people may however not be generalised. Crimes such as theft, the embezzlement of money, a holdup and murder, should be sued. The underlying motives for these illegal acts are often avarice and bloodlust, two behaviours that cannot be justified. These criminals are often downright evil and cannot be reasoned with. Let us hope that a stay in prison will chasten them.
Concluding, I believe that a civilised society should punish its real criminals, although the punishments may not imply any torture whatsoever. In this respect, the death penalty has to be put forward. I have objections of principle to the execution of the death penalty, and therefore the legality of it in some countries is hard for me to accept. After the hanging of a Dutchman in Singapore, there is a growing body of public arguments that this penalty is part of the country's tradition, and they feel the abolition of it would harm their national identity. A custom that gives people the right to decide over a person's life is, however, not something to be proud of.

DBAN2042,3.0,3.0,,,,,Feminists have done more harm to the cause of women than good,"
People who agree with this statement generally believe that the only board woment are fit for is the drain-board. Whereas others will get annoyed just reading the title. They argue that women have to be radical in their approach to become the equal of the men. We are getting there, yet maybe a little bit too slow.
This brings us to the question:""What does feminism really stands for?"" the women's movement aspires to improve the position of the woman in the cultural, economic, social, and political field. Assuming naturally that women are considered less important than men. There were two feministic avalanches: On the one hand there was one that started at the end of the nineteenth century, and on the other hand a feministic avalanch began in the late sixties.
The ideology of the Women's Liberation Movement has three main tendencies: Firstly there is the reformative or ""civil rights""-feminism. They strive for the granting of equal rights to women. In other words women emancipation.
Secondly we have radical feminism or women's liberation, they want to do away with the standards, values and patterns of behaviour that continue to make women inferior to men. Finally there is also socialistic feminism. They aim at the liberation of women linked to the struggle against the inequality between the social classes. These three tendencies all strive after equality, liberation, emancipation, etc. on the cultural, economic, social and political area. The cultural position of the women has won more and more prestige the last few years. Painters, writers, actrices, singers, models, ..., they all obtained a certain Hollywood status. A lot of them are the symbols of emancipated and liberated women. they can even be considered to be superior where models (and other areas) are concerned.
On the contrary, the married women's social position in society has not changed much. Women are still doing the housework and taking care of the children, even though they may have a job. But unmarried and divorced women are now becoming more independed. Two tendencies can be noted: A lot of women want to have a career of some kind so that they get out once in a while and not be financially depended on their life partner. They still have to fight twice as hard to achieve the same goal than a man. Some men though choose to be houseman while their wifes go out to work. The above-mentioned is still a taboo that has to be broken. To conclude we can say that the social position is ""gradually"" improving.
Finally, there is the women's political position. More and more women are interested in politics and want to go into politics. The last few years we have seen an increse in women politicians. Some parties see it as a new kind of political propaganda to put women in important positions, but they still form less than ten percent of all the politicians. So the increase in women politicians should be strongly encouraged.
To conclude, the Women's Liberation Movement strives for equal rights, liberation and emancipation. They not only want it in the social, economic, cultural field, but also in the political field. All women, even men, should devote themselves to this necessity. So that the the only board women are fit for is NOT the dran-board.

DBAN2043,3.5,3.0,,,,,All armies should consist entirely of professional soldiers: there is no value in a system of military service,"
A lot of people, including me, are in favour of a professional army; Others do not like the idea of it. To confirm my opinion, I shall enumerate some pros and cons of the military service.
Most students who are in higher education belong to the category that is in favour of an army of professional soldiers. When you finished secondary education, and you want to go to university, you do not do your military service first. This means that you have to postpone your military service. And when you have finally taken your certificate after years of hard work, you want to prove you are worth your certificate, so you apply for a job. But you cannot; you have to do your military service first. Many people who are in this situation think that this is a waste of time: you lose an entire year. So they want to get rid of the military service.
Another disadvantage of the military service is that it costs an awful lot of money. Too much money, according to those people. They think there are better ways to spend it: aid to the Third World, pay off the national debt or subsidize education a bit more. But instead, they spend money on equipment for the army: if you have a big army, you need a lot of equipment, such as tanks, munition, guns, armoured cars, etd, so that the soldiers can learn how these things work. So, if you have a professional army, you need to buy less equipment, less food, less clothes, etc. And in proportion you have a better trained army.
A third disadvantage is the degree of motivation. A lot of the people who still have to do their military service, are not very motivated. Most of them have a family or a girlfriend, have a job or could have one in a short time. So why should they give all this up? If they were not obliged to do so, only a small majority would do their military service.
An advantage of an army that consists of professional soldiers is that it is better trained and easier to bring into action. If being soldier is your profession, you are more motivated and you are better trained. But if an army largely consists of voluntary soldiers, the military instructors have to begin from scratch: they still have to learn everything, so this takes time. And the military service only lasts for about one year, so that they cannot learn everything. But if you have professional soldiers, they will become more and more skilful.
This can be illustrated with an example: if there is a famine in a barren African country, professional, well-trained soldiers will have a bigger chance to help these people than the conscripts, who are not trained for that kind of missions. Whereas you have a professional army, you can train it for various kinds of missions, like this one.
There are of course also some people who are in favour of the military service, and they also have decisive arguments; One of them is that the army is one of the symbols of a nation: if you have a big army, you get a lot of regard. The other countries will respect you.
Another argument is that an army of conscripts will cost less money than a professional one: you have to pay wages and they too need a lot of equipment: they also need munition, tanks and other weapons to fight and to practise with.
As you see, there are more pros than cons on the subject of the abolition of the military service. So I think it would be better to abolish the military service and replace it by an army of professional soldiers (this has already happened in Belguim!).

DBAN2049,4.0,3.5,,,,,The prison system is outdated. No civilized society should punish its criminals: it should rehabilitate them,"
The prison system is the symbol of total isolation from society. First of all, the criminals are detained to prevent them from repeating their crime(s) and furthermore to protect society. But criminals also have to be prepared, during their imprisonment, to return to society. The present system can't live up to those goals, so alternative punishment has to be found.
The roots of the prison system go back to the nineteenth century. Prisons were built to replace cruel and unnecessary corporal punishment like brand marks, deportation or the pillory. The prisoners were completely isolated during the day and at night without any form of communication and the main idea was penance through hard labour.
Nowadays, the system has totaly turned around. As crime rates are increasing, prisons all over the world are getting more crowded and you can find the same problems in prison that society is facing: drugs, violence... On top of that, there is a great lack of competent people to deal with the criminals, their rehabilitation program and resettlement service after their release on parole. Budgets are exceeded and no sufficient fund can be raised to set up a proper rehabilitation system so that prisoners can learn how to adapt to society.
It is obvious that the present penal system has to be changed. Criminals have to be seperated according to the extent of their crime(s) and treaten likewise. The government has to increase the budget, so that it can provide satisfactory guidance for the 'hard cases', for instance cold-blooded murderers, psychopaths and so on. These people need to be isolated from society, for instance in a mental hospital, because they are a real danger to people; every individual needs proper treatment and psychiatric evaluation. Criminals with less serious offences or crimes on their record, on the other hand, should be psychologically examined; when those criminals show regret for what they've done, they should be given the opportunity to make up for the damage they've caused. The criminal law has to be extended to the point that criminals can be recommanded a delay in punishment or even a reprieve.
In this perspective, the alternative punishment 'arbitration' was introduced; the criminal will be confronted with his behaviour and the consequences and he has to look for solutions; for instance getting involved in social work. The victim can play an active role in this process of 'arbitration', so that he or she can get fully compensated. After that, the criminal can return to society. This process of arbitration between victim and criminal (before the punishment in prison has been set) has been tested in several courts and surprising results support the experiment. Judges really consider the arbitration between victim and criminal. And many people believe that if the system gets introduced officially and can include convicted criminals, the overcrowding in prisons can be seriously reduced. Quick and efficient rehabilitation is emphasized and less money will go down the drain because it is spent sensibly. The criminals will benefit from this system because they can return to society without being sent to jail to pick up a bad habit or two in the process.
The prison system is slowly changing, but it will probably take a little more time and effort for the 'civilised society' to be able to provide criminals with the treatment they really need to be adapted in society again.

DBAN2051,2.5,2.0,,,,,"Some people say that in our modern world, dominated by science and technology and industrialisation, there is no longer a place for dreaming and imagination. What is your opinion?","
This is only partly true. The main cause of this lack of imagination is television. Whenever you watch television, you lose your fantasy. Especially now the films often are sequences of quick flashes and violence. Even the old cartoons have been replaced by violent Japanese animation. Children who watch TV all day long are proven to be more agressive. They will not find any pleasure in playing with ordinary toys because they miss the imagination to make those toys alive. The toy industry itself capitalises on this: they make dolls who talk, cars which you can drive (on remote control), weapons which look and sound like real ones, little figures like on TV, loaded with weapons, etc... If you give a wooden toy to these children, they will never play with it, because it does not look real and they do not know it is up to them to make it real.
Recent research has shown us that watching TV also makes people, and especially youngsters, depressed. They probably get depressed by looking at the ""dreamworld"" presented in advertisements, soapseries and films. TV presents a world with beautiful people, perfect jobs, the best love-life and easy money. But we should turn off the TV and realize what real life is. What is more pleasant to do than to sit outside on a splendid summers day. When you feel the warmth on your skin and you breathe fresh air, you close your eyes and you start dreaming.
It is very important to exclude stress. You have to be relaxed and think of all the pleasant things in life. This is the best way to avoid depression. You just have to think of something you like, and off you go.
I personally dream a lot. Whenever there is something I do not like; a boring lecture, an argument at home or simply nothing to do, I flee to my own private world where nobody disturbs me and where I can live the most crazy things. It is very effective, but I sometimes lose control. I wake up to realize that I have been talking out loud what I was day-dreaming. Another problem consists of dreaming when you have to listen to something important.
Daydreaming is very nice; it is the best medicine to combat stress. It makes you happy and improves your capacity of imagination.
Another thing to escape the destructive influence of TV, is reading a good novel. How pleasant it is to read an enthralling novel and to imagine what the people look like, how their voices sound, what the old house smells like etc...
After reading a book, you are often dissappointed when you see the film, because the athmosphere is rarely the same. Moreover, monsters are never more horrible than in your own head. There is nothing more spooky than reading a horror book and imagining everything. After a while, you hardly dare to turn the pages.
I do realize that people who work all day prefer watching a good film at night, but I think it is very harmful to watch television for hours on end, zapping all the time because there is nothing interesting.
When the sun is shining, we have to go out for a walk. The fresh air makes you sleep and dream better at night. And whenever you feel like it, make some time and dream away: it will make you happy.

DBAN2052,3.0,2.0,,,,,The prison system is outdated. No civilized society should punish its criminals: it should rehabilitate them,"
Prisons are overfull thesedays. It seems as if more and more people commit crimes. Present-day punishments don't seem to put them off. And why should they be put off? They commit a crime and if they are very unlucky they are caught. If there is room enough, they have to go to prison but they are out in no time. It's also possible however, that they aren't punished at all. When the prisons are overfull they are often released on bail. You should think that more prisons would solve the problem. Unfortunately there are people that don't like this idea. They claim that our prison system is outdated. A civilized society shouldn't punish its criminals. Well what should we do then? Reward them for their bad behaviour?
Hundreds of years ago society wasn't as tolerant towards criminals as it is now. (Maybe in some countries society still isn't). When a criminal had stolen something his hand was cut off. When a criminal had killed someone he was killed too. As the saying goes; an eye for an eye, a toot for a tooth. Nowadays this doesn't happen anymore. Most countries abolished capital punishment and if they didn't they practically don't issue it anymore. There are also countries though where this is different. The United States is an example of that. In the US there are several states that still have capital punishment, and criminals were killed recently.
In my opinion capital punishment shouldn't be allowed. Society doesn't want murderers to kill people, but why should society be allowed to do it? People don't have the right to decide over life and death. You can't possibly decide when someone should get capital punishment. Do you sentence someone to death when he killed twenty people or when he only killed two? It's impossible to draw a line here, because every case is different, you can't compare them. The one and only factor that is the same in all cases, is that there are people involved. And people shouldn't be killed.
When capital punishment is abolished, other punishments remain. The most common punishment is imprisonment. I don't agree with the statement that the prison system is outdated. Why shouldn't criminals be punished? They knew what they were doing at the time and they also knew what the consequences would be. Punishing people maybe sounds outdated but it certainly isn't. Some people even think that it is much too modern. But then they are thinking about the cells. They say prisoners have too much priviliges thesedays. They have private cells, television, fitness centres, etc. But I don't agree with that either.
Sure sometimes it seems as if prisons aren't much of a punishment anymore, but they are. When criminals are in prison they don't have their freedom anymore, and freedom is the most important thing to humankind. Just try to stay in one room for a few hours. It doesn't matter if you have television, video, a game computer, or whatever. After a few hours you will probably want to get out of that room as soon as possible.
Imprisonment however, is not the right punishment in all cases. I do not want to discuss all the offences plus matching punishments right now, but I do want to mention a few minor offences. In case of vandalism for instance, it wouldn't be right to put the offenders into prison. Hooligans are very often underage and it's easier to keep them on the right track when they stay out of prison.
The best way to make them aware of the kind of damage they caused is to let them pay for it. Don't let their parents foot the bill, they won't learn anything from it.
Alternative punishments are another way to punish minor offenders. Instead of paying for the damages they have to work for it. When they put graffiti on a wall, they have to clean it. When they stole something from a supermarket, they have to work in one for a while. They aren't paid for it, and considering the fact that today's youth is very money-oriented it is a good punishment.
The purpose of all punishments is very clear. Society wants criminals/offenders to get on the right track again. They have to leave their criminal past behind and return into society. this is not very easy. Once you entered the criminal circuit it is very difficult to get out. That is why there is the system of rehabilitation. Criminals are offered help; they can attend courses during which they learn a trade, they are told how to apply for a job and how to find a place to live, etc. This doesn't mean that the rehabilitation system works for everybody. It is not a perfect system and society often makes it very difficult for ex-criminals too; once a criminal, always a criminal. So a lot of things have to be improved but in the meantime people get back on the right track again. Maybe someday society won't punish its criminals anymore, but at this moment we can't do without it.

DBAN2054,3.5,3.0,3.0,2.0,2.5,4.0,Crime does not pay,"
Have you ever taken anything without asking, even the smallest thing? In some countries this is considered stealing and they cut off your hand for it. That's the way the legal system works: he that nischief hatsches, mischief catches.
Centuries ago, crimes were already being committed, and evn then people had their laws and punishments. But in those days, the punishments were more severe than they are now. In the Middle Ages, for example, woman who were believed to be witches, were sent to the stake. From the thirteenth century on, a king could have anyone beheaded: people who didn't agree with his ideas, and even his wife (in the case of Henry VIII). For the more ""usual"" crimes, you would be drawn and quartered, and - in later centuries - hanged. All these methods have disappeared, even the death penalty was, luckily enough, abolished a number of years ago. But in some countries, where the Church and religion still play an important role, the punishments have not become as ""civilized"" as here in Belgium.
What are the punishments you can get for committing a crime? Well, let's first say that it depends on a number of things: First, the sort of crime you committed: It will be a lot worse if you murder someone, than when you drive through the red light! You have a lot of rules in the law that you can break, and for each violation a judge will determine your punishment. When he does this, he will keep in mind the second important thing, and that is your age. If you are a minor and you have done something wrong, they will normally put you in a mental home, for re-education. When you are found guilty of murder, you will be put under the surveillance of a psychiatrist, and you will be sent to a detention centre. You would be amazed if you knew how many minors have to go to this kind of institutions. Is our legal system harsh enough? Well, in some cases I would say that they had better be more strict when it concerns violations. Rich people, for example, can use their money and influence to find a decent lawyer in the first place, and also to influence the judge or jury. I think in the case of O.J. Simpson, this is a fact: I think his lawyers and he have enough connections to put it all on the long term. Or at least, they will try. And the ministers, are they untouchable, or not? In my opinion, ministers are in a privileged position to fill their pockets whenever they feel the need, but in the end there's always someone who's not afraid of standing up to them and brings the truth out into the open. But, as ministers belong to the powerful persons of the state and it's easy to say that there was a procedural mistake; they always know a way to clear their names.
So, we have a legal system to make us pay for the rules we break, but some persons stand above all that. So, this is the way the legal system works? Does crime pay, after all?

All armies should consist entirely of professional soldiers: there is no value in a system of military service. This is a self-evident statement. Military service is not something you enjoy or do for pleasure; it's something you are obliged to do. People are always reluctant to do things they don't really want to do. So if you introduce a military service, only reluctant boys will show up. That's just the nature of men: they always love to do things they can decide for themselves, but if something is forced upon them they will resent it. There is no gain in forcing people to serve their country if they don't have the desire to do so. There are of course men or women who want to join the army, but they become professionals. This is once again self-evident.
Take an army that consists entirely of conscripts and an army that consists entirely of professionals and compare the results or their actions. The conscripts are just wasting their time with all kinds of stupid jobs and in the end they haven't learned a single thing; except to shut up and listen. The professionals on the other hand are trained in particular aspects of military life. they become good at their jobs and they will contribute something to the society. For example the ones who are trained to intervene military in a foreign country which is in trouble. They know what to do in those circumstances and they really make a difference. They have the right knowledge and equipment to help the people there. But a bunch of consripts will not do so much good. People won't respect them and they will have no influence at all. They will only make matters worse.
Another advantage for an army full of professionals is that they can specialize in a certain undertaking. For instance last week (the week of 6 December) a specialezed force of the Belgian army was doing some exercises in order to prepare the rescue of the Belgian soldiers in former Yougoslavia. They were especially trained for this purpose. You could never ask conscripts to undertake this kind of action.
But joining the army can also be a dream coming true for certain people. But for others it is a nightmare. It is obvious that the former will become professionals and most of them will really make a career in the army. The latter are the victims of the system.
Another ridiculous thing about the system of military service is that it costs a large amount of money which is totally thrown away: all the uniforms, the arms, the accomodation, the food and so on. There are better sources to spend all this money.
If you only take an elite of professional soldiers, it will be both cheaper and more efficient than the system of military service.
There isn't a single reason for a military service: it costs lots of money and it is inefficient. Nobody wants it and nobody needs it. Except maybe for some spoilt boys who are sent to become ""a man"" in the army. Although I doubt it will be a successful undertaking.

DBAN2057,3.0,2.5,,,,,"Some people say that in our modern world, dominated by science and technology and industrialisation, there is no longer a place for dreaming and imagination. What is your opinion?","
The statement in the title can be split up in three different enunciations: 1. Our modern world is dominated by science, technology and industrialization.
2. In our modern world, there is no longer a place for dreaming and imagination.
3. In our world the lack, absence or impossibility of dreaming and imagination is due to the domination of science, technology and industrialization.
I'll have a closer look at these three enunciations.
1. Undoubtedly, the technological ingenuity in our modern world attains a level that it has never attained before, thanks to the numerous applications of scientific understandings. Notably cybernetcis, telecommunication and information science contribute to the fast development and distribution of new products on a very large scale. But in spite of the stimulating influence of the world trade, we have to conclude that the advantages of the technological ""civilization"" are restricted to large population groups in Europe, North America, Japan, Australia and New Zealand and to smaller or even very small parts of the population in Latin America, Asia and Africa. Only one out of four or five people on this earth really enjoys the scientific, technical and industrial progress. For many others, ignorance, primitive means of support, yes even hunger and violence still threaten or prevail. This statement shows us in the first place the egocentricity of well-to-do people: they consider themselves the navel of the earth and generalize their well-being, thus forgetting the ""existance-experience"" of 3/4th of the world population. However, these 3 out 4 fellow citizens also belong to ""our modern world"" from 1994, 1995 in a little while!
2. That there is no time anymore for dreaming and imagination, has to be put into perspective: - the science-fiction-films with - among other things - violence in the leading role, - the inventiveness of the advertising world who, besides kitsch and dull publicity, also creates very playful and imaginative products, - the creative power of software-, machine-, telecommunication-,... designers, - the many efforts to save the environment,...
It is also very difficult to deny that the offer of so many ready-made products and programs causes children, adolescents and adults to be less creative; - children play with finished toys according to strictly definite intruction rules and don't construct their toys and playrules themselves any longer.
- adolescents get easily carried away by the imposed consumption-attitude and most of the time they take up a slovenly and greedy position; in friendship relations, people choose less often the gradual way of approach and growth towards understanding and harmony, in the advantage of self-interest; - adults have to work so hard to earn high salaries, which are particularly necessary to buy the consumption articles the advanced society offers them, that they can only watch impersonally and passively to so-called relaxation programs on television.
But all these observations are still too general. First of all, they keep silent the efforts of hundreds of men and thousands of women in their family relations (admitted: it should be thousands of men as well); here we find a lot of inventiveness and realized dreams. Secondly, these observations especially concern that one fourth or fith that is so full of technological prosperity that it isn't a challenge anymore to tackle life creatively. In what a different way does life pass for whom ? In the Third and Fourth World, 8-year-old children themselves make little cars with pieces of bamboo, wood and sisal. And adults build houses with recycling materials of all kinds... In the third place, our youth has more and more the wish for a world where people find time again to meet, to dream... How else can we explain the increasing enthusiasm for poetry? In 1994, more than 4,000 young people sent in more than 14,000 poems to the competition ""Jeugd en Pozie""!
3. From the specifications we have introduced in the first and second statement, we can conclude that for those parts of the world population that are privileged by the riches and domination of technology and industrialization in our modern world, there is less place left for dreaming and imagination, as they are already so filled with individualism, egocentrism and self-satisfaction. But for 3 out of 4 people in this world, life still continues to be a struggle, so that they need daily invention and imagination to protect themselves from bad moments, and even dreaming to support such bad moments in their lives.
And concentrating on the future, we dare suppose that our world feels a crying need for - dreams of an equal, fair world where everyone is well off - imagination to spread the wealth in this world over everyone - perception to let rivalry, egocentricity, and pusillanimous selfishness dominate by worldwide solidarity among all people.

Nowadays, in this modern society that is dominated by science, technology and industrialisation, people's lives are very hectic. Family life is not what it used to be, especially when there is a working mother.
The beginning of a new day is actually the beginning of a race against time, a battle to get to the end of the day.
In the morning, the parents have to get ready for work and the children have to be dressed, fed and dropped off at school.
This is already the worst part of the day for some people.
After the children have been taken care off, mum and dad each go their seperate ways with their own car. When standing in the daily traffic jam, they become nervous wrecks before the working day has even started.
At work they are constantly bossed around and like little puppies they obey their superiors. When they finally get a little break, someone ruins that too by telling them all the (n)ever wanted to know about his or her troubled marriage and delinquent children.
When the working day is finally over, the traffic jam is again waiting for them. But they don't really care anymore. They just sit there intheir cars, staring at the car in front of them like little demented creatures.
When they come home, mum starts to prepare dinner while dad picks up the children from school.
At dinner the children are fighting about who's got the most friends and mum and dad are looking at each other like ""What did we do to deserve all this?""
Dad clears the table while mum gets dressed for her French evening lesson, which she is obliged to follow by her employer.
Dad then gets the children ready for their volleyball training and drives them to the sports centre. There, he meets a lot of other dads who have just dropped off their children. They are all watching the game, shouting at their children how well they are playing but they are really thinking: ""My grandmother who is 100 years old plays better than that. And in the meantime, they are complaining to the other dads how much their backs hurt and that their wives are giving them a hard time.
By 9 o'clock, both mum and dad come home, feeling as though they had just ran a thousand miles. They put the children to bed and give them a routine kiss. Mum and dad hit the sack as well. They give each other a little hug as to say: ""We made it through another day"", turn out the lights and a few minutes later they have both dozed off.
When you look at these people's lives, you could say that they don't have any time left to dream and fantasize because of their busy lives. They don't have any time to themselves. But, I think people these days dream even more. They desire for a better life. I think that when they are stuck in a traffic jam, people begin day-dreaming. Everybody needs to be able to fantasize to become happy. Because remember: your life is worth nothing without your dreams!

In contemporary science, the sky has ceased to be the limit for a long time now. There just seems no stopping technological progress now. People are making machines that can almost do anything, for example help create even more powerful machines. But some say ""the human being"" is facing a serious threat of being pushed aside by technology. Furthermore, in our contemporary world scientific progress has become the standard so that dreaming and imagination (i. e. more or less non-progressive activities) are said to have no place in modern life.
I believe nothing is further from the truth. Apart from industrialisation (which causes much alienation, I'm sure), science technology is also responsible for whole new modes of expression. That's because modern high tech is also prevailing in the entertainment industry, which has been creating new ways for people to set their imagination free.
First there's the new technology in cinema. Just recently I attended a lecture of Irvin Kershner during which he showed the benefits of the new development in special effects : ""Digital Graffix"". By using this technology, it is now possible for everyone to actually give expression to their dreams and fantasy. All you need nowadays is a powerful computer and the right software and off you go. Thanks to Digital Graffix, there are really no limits to what the silver screen can show, because whatever can be imagined can be shown as well. But we don't have to go as far as cinema. Many would-be artists that lack the right skill to create visual art, can still give way to their imagination with the right drawing software. That's very important in a world where art is far more mind-based than skill-based. I'm not saying that we are going to be flooded with PC-painters, but I think that far more people will be creating visual art, now it is possible to visualize their imagination and get good results to boot.
Then there's the revolution in computer entertainment : the interactive game. In computer games like ""Myst"" you are actually put in a completely different and cybernetic world. You become part of the action. Perhaps it is true you need to use your imagination more when reading a book, but on the other hand interactive games startle your fantasy more than -let's say- regular television or movies. And of course there's also the creator of the game, who has to be really imaginative to create whole new worlds for their public to roam. So also in this field, imagination is indispensable.
But science progress has been propitious for other creative disciplines as well. I'm just picking out a few things : think about video-camera's getting cheaper and cheaper, so that more and more people can film the ""story of their life"" or think about digital musical instruments, allowing musicians to make music, without having to buy an expensive grand piano.
Perhaps it is true that technological progress may have a lot of drawbacks, but the oppression of dreaming and imagination sure isn't one of them. Technology has found newer. simpler and cheaper ways to bestow creative power upon people and this has to be an enormous boost for imagination.

DBAN3005,3.5,4.0,,,,,"Some people say that in our modern world, dominated by science and technology and industrialisation, there is no longer a place for dreaming and imagination. What is your opinion?","
In my opinion science needs imagination to evolve, to grow. So there is still place for dreaming and imagination and I think there have never been as much dreamers as in our modern world.
Claiming the opposite is quite wrong according to me.
Technology makes it possible for people to make their dream known to the whole world. The best example is the whole filmindustry, with ""Jurassic Park"" as outstanding example. Creatures which have been extincted for millions of years now seem to live again on the screen. The whole market of science-fiction movies is another example of how the ideas of a few men are shown to an audience of millions of people. In fact every movie uses the dreams and imagination of its creators to enchant whole masses.
Music is another example. There is a music-style, called ambient, which tries to create so-called soundscapes. By using modern technology very strange sounds are produced which make you feel as if you were floating in the sky on a strange planet. You can even imagine a whole landscape only by listening to this music. So science makes it possible for you to dream the dream of someone else. It is as if the dream becomes alive and all you have to do is watch and listen. But at the same time this seems to be the disadvantage of ""techno-dreams"". A small minority dreams and the majority of the people just swallows what is presented to them. Can't they dream or use their imagination theirselves?
Yes, they can, but on another level. In order to have a purpose to live for everybody has some dream. That needn't be a great, wild dream about earning millions in one month or becoming world-famous as an actor or a singer. It can also be situated in small areas. A nice talk with a neighbour, a long forgotten schoolfriend who all of a sudden turns up, a shiny day which makes you good-humoured, all this stimulates you to dream about what might happen in your future. without the smallest dream (hoping to find some food to survive one more day) you can't maintain the strength to live. That's the power of humanity which distinguishes us from animals: the dream, the ability to use imagination. To state that there is no longer place for dreaming and imagination is to state that humanity doesn't exist anymore. The dream is essential in our lives, in everybody's life.
It may sound paradoxical, but it is exactly science and industry that needs the imagination of the scientists to develop. To invent something means to imagine how things should work when you do this or that. The scientist needs to be creative, otherwise he won't come to something new. He has to break with tradition, use his imagination to think of something that could be explained in another, more exact way than before. Without this imaginative power we wouldn't know about atomic structures or electricity or psychology. Represent science technology as a world without imagination is too radical.
But there is one point in which the saying might be right. The labourers that are employed in factories and which have to fulfill very tiresome tasks don't have much time to use their imagination. I think the work they are doing degrades them to robots which have to fulfill only one task without thinking or showing any form of creativity. But this problem has to do with the whole structure of our society and in my opinion it can't be solved unless we change our world-view and try out another structure to base our society on. So, there is still a lot to dream about, that's for sure.

DBAN3006,2.5,3.0,,,,,The prison system is outdated. No civilized society should punish its criminals: it should rehabilitate them,"
Shall we put the man who killed your son back on the street or must we lock him up in a cold, dark cell with nothing to eat but his own excrements?
Both solutions are very extreme. Murderers shouldn't be rehabilitated and they shouldn't be treated like animals either. But what about minor criminals, like robbers and vandals?
Some people just steal or beat somebody up for the kick of it because they like the feeling of power. These persons belong in prison, andmaybe they should get psychological help.
Another category of people commits crimes because they don't have any money or because they're bored, due to the unemployment problem. It is this group that can be rehabilitated. The state should give those people alternative punishments and afterwards help them to find jobs. Once the malefactors have work, the boredom and the lack of money will dissapear and as a result, they won't commit crims again. There are a few reasons for not throwing somebody of the last category in a cell. Prison is a nursery of crimes, since all the 'bad guys' are put together in one place,so that they can learn dirty tricks from one another. Moreover, prisons are over - populated and this promotes aggression. The prisoners will more easily develop a hate against the society which has put them behind bars.
A man who has spent some time in gaol will have a hard time finding a job, because society doesn't accept ex - prisoners. As an unemployed workman, he will get frustrated and bored again, and the transition to criminal life is easily made again. To break this vicious circle, a plan should be framed to integrate delinquents in society by helping them to get jobs. Once they have some work to do, the boredom and the deficiency too, will be gone.
Murderers, rapers and other 'big' criminals mustn't be rehabilitated. But maybe emprisonment only isn't such a good solution either. Alternative punishments could be given. A raper for example, should work gratuitously for the state during the time he has to spend in prison. Maybe they could build homes for the elderly or youth centers. At night they should get 'board and lodging' in prison of course.
Criminals are mostly people with a lot of social and personal problems, so it would be helpful if there were people whom they could talk to. A group of social workers should always be there to help, not only through talking, but also by giving practical advices.
Prison system is outdated. The governments should deal with the unemployment problem first instead of building more prisons. Rehabilitation would be a good solution for a certain group of criminals, others should be forced to work for good causes.
So people, before you decide to rob a bank or shoot your mother-in-law, consider the consequences: no luxurious stay in prison-Hilton anymore, but a few years of hard slavery.

DBAN3011,3.0,2.5,,,,,Feminists have done more harm to the cause of women than good,"
The cause of Women is not a cause like any other cause. It is the struggle of more than half of the world population for basic rights and equal treatment. The struggle for equality between men and women is the most difficult one can imagine. It's not like the struggle of ethnic groups, races, nations or religions. Women have no territory, no worldwide culture or ideology. Women are not fighting for the rights of a group as a whole but for the rights of the female individual to be herself. It is a matter of being who you are, without having to fullfil the role that men have forced upon women on the basis of physical strength. This conflict cannot be settled in a war or through terrorist actions. Both men and women have got to go through a proces of change of mental constitution.
At first the fight was hard but concrete. In the beginning of this century the suffragettes fought for the right, to speak. They had a very clear goal, i.e. to get women the right to vote, and they achieved it.
Along the way feminism has been able to break with the traditional role play of husband and wife, in which the wife is looked at home looking after everything, and in which the husband goes to work and to the pub. Nowadays men occasionally do the dishes and if their wives are not around they'll have a go at changing a nappy or two. Women can have a carreer, and they can even go to bars. They can wear anything they like. Children? No problem! The mothers can still work part time. Their husbands just happen to earn a little bit more, so it's only natural the women give up their full time jobs. This is only basic knowledge, of course. It's a disgrace that women have had to fight for so long to get this superficial result.
Still this result seemed enough to convince a lot of people that every woman has everything in her own hands. Feminism didn't seem to have any use anymore. In the eighties the great mass got tired of this movement. Feminists were said to be all lesbians and manhaters. Most women couldn't identify themselves anymore with this kind of feminism.
In fact the feministic movement was desperately in need of something new. But it has taken them quite a long time to make up for the mistakes made in the past. Anno 1994 a lot of practical problems or injustices have been solved. But the hardest part is still to come: men and women have to create a totally different of mentality. A society can only succeed when both the sexes are being treated equally. This means that both men and women treat the opposite sexe as equal in variety. However, this'll probably take another forty of fifty years. Until then it's still a men's world, but, as the song goes, it would be nothing without a woman.

DBAN3013,3.0,3.0,,,,,"Some people say that in our modern world, dominated by science and technology and industrialisation, there is no longer a place for dreaming and imagination. What is your opinion?","
Ever since the seventeenth century, in fact since the Renaissance, the Western world has been characterised by an increasing interest in the products of reason: science, technology and industrialisation.
What could have been a blessing -dealing with prejudices and superstition by means of science- has really become a curse: only that which can be accurately measured or counted is taken as true.
As a result, a great part of reality, and perhaps even the most interesting part, is neglected or even considered non-existent. In scientific psychology for example, man is seen merely as a black box. Whereas only the ways in which people react to stimuli are studied, the occupations of the mind are ignored. Memories, dreams, emotions, intuitions and moral values are irrelevant in a society dominated by science.
This so-called curse for that matter, is not restricted to our vision on mankind; it concerns our whole reality. Whatever cannot be scientifically proven is of no interest. In my opinion, the result of this overvaluation of science, of this scientism, is a rather impoverished world view.
However, had scientific research been a theoretical matter only, the disaster would have been limited still. But unfortunately, there is no other standard than science itself, which means that there are no restraints to the development of its products, technology and industrialisation, either. Traditional wisdom and moral doubts are replaced by the dazzling temptations of endless technological possibilities. More and more, a ""wel-functioning"" human being within this technologized world is becoming a robot, created by the conditioning techniques of scientific psychology. Every now and then, a wave of protest emerges. This doesn't happen regularly, for most people swim with the stream -especially if this stream is called ""progress"" and entails convenience and consumption.
Such a wave rolled over the sixties. Many reacted against the one-sided rationality of our society. Students wrote  on the walls of Paris; hippies drew back from society;  and  were the message. The protest ebbed away. Was it too radical? Were the opposite powers too strong?
In any case, the hero of society became once again -and more than ever- the nearly-spent worker, the overburdened moralist of production, constantly on the verge of a nervous breakdown, whose happiness could be measured by the size of his car. In this struggle for power, success and wealth, modern man stops at nothing, not even at himself. Lead by self-control, and persistence, these heroes and their admirers deny the ""needs of their minds"".
Many people nowadays worship no other god than the god of possession and pursue the realisation of purely materialistic dreams. Yet it's not technology and consumption that fulfill the deepest needs of man. The mind doesn't settle down in the hustle and bustle of modern times, but it does so in contact with values and truths that go beyond the rational.
 Can this be said of a microwave? And finally, isn't imagination more important than knowledge, as Einstein said? Don't these irrational powers in man get him away from the shallowness and emptiness in which he is otherwise plunged?
Though it may seem so, it is not my intention to attack science and its products. It's rather the onesidedness I object to. A fully irrational world would for that matter be just as great a terror.
Science, dream and imagination complement one another; their harmonious cooperation is the aim, not the dominance of one of them. The question is whether humanity will ever be capable of achieving this ultimate synthesis.

DBAN3016,3.0,3.0,,,,,All armies should consist entirely of professional soldiers: there is no value in a system of military service,"
For decades military service has been a normal aspect of the army. But a few years ago, on the initiative of the Minister of Defence, the Belgian parliament decided to do away with conscription. That decision was quite a relief to most young men, who dreaded the idea of joining the army. The abolition of military service fits in with an entire reorganization of the army, which should become more professional. After the fall of the Berlin wall communism was no longer a threat. So most European countries started reorganizing their armies. But in no country measures to reduce military forces were taken so quickly and drastically as in Belgium.
Many conscripts used to think that military service was useless: they lost a year on the labour market, they were ordered to do any job except the one they were schooled in and they missed their family and friends. Nevertheless, you can meet people who are strongly convinced that conscription also had good points.
Of course many conscripts had to do all sorts of odd jobs, but others were able to acquire experience in their profession. The army needed for instance doctors and teachers, but those who did the boring work were also indispensable. Some of them, mostly people with a lower education, even stayed in the army after they had accomplished their military service. A military career was about the only possibility they had to make a living.
The confrontation between different social classes often lead to mutual appreciation: higher educated or rich lads often knew nothing about lower educated or poor boys and vice versa. But in the army they were bowed to share the same way of life.
The army is kind of society in itself: it has its own housing department, churches and health service. But because those people are of a type almost vanished, parishes, medical centres and hospitals became badly understaffed and had to be given up. The Minister of Defence wanted to engage civilians to do something about the shortage of personnel. Theywould sign a contract and volunteer to join the arm for five years. In itself this would be a good alternative to conscription, but nobody takes much interest in this kind of temporary commitment. When conscription was introduced, its aim was to maintain the independence and to defend the territory of the country. Nowadays however, that duty is almost superfluous and the humanitarian commissions have become more important than the strictly military ones. Under command of the UMO, soldiers are deployed to re-establish peace in war-stricken countries. The troops that are sent to these areas consist of professionals. Even though the UMO-soldiers try to avoid conflicts, some of them get killed.
Warfare has become a highly technological and sophisticated business; this was shown in the high-tech war between Iraq and the rest of the world in January 1991. If we take the humanitarian and technological aspects of warfare into account and if an army remains necessary, it should be built and run by well-trained professionals.

DBAN3017,3.0,2.5,,,,,Feminists have done more harm to the cause of women than good,"
In this essay I seek to demonstrate that it is only thanks to several feminist movements in modern Western civilization that men and women have, at least theoretically, equal rights.
Feminist or women's movements advocate same rights and chances for men and women. They try to change the present system to give women equality with men, especially in the cultural, economic and juridical areas.
These movements also want traditional role patterns to be broken down. in my opinion, many feminists grossly oversimplify these traditional role patterns when they reduce them to a matter of social convention. The difference between men and women is basically natural, it is not merely culturally, i.e. artificially, determined. In primitive life, man's natural superior strength provided protection to women, particularly while they were in the final stages of their pregnancy. This of course does not mean women are inferior to men. Political equality for every human being, man or woman, black or white, is desirable and necessary. In this context the concept ""gender"" is often used. ""Gender"" is the sex which nature has imposed upon us, it is unchangeable, we must accept it.
The problem is that women are often regarded as deviating from the male norm. It is only thanks to several great women and their accompanying movements that this norm is not as rigid anymore as it used to be. The first important feminist was the Romantic Mary Wollstonecraft, mother of Mary Shelley and author of 'A Vindication of the Rights of Woman'. Romanticism was a reaction against the preceding Enlightenment. An important idea of the Romantics was freedom of the individual, so freedom of the female individual as well.
At the beginning of the twentieth century, a group of women caused upheaval by chaining themselves to important buildings. These women called themselves 'Suffragettes': they fought for suffrage, i.e. the right to vote, for women. But the agitations did not have an immediate success. It was not until a few decades later their aim was achieved. Since then every grown-up woman has been able to vote.
Contemporary feminism developed from the postwar generation of the Sixties. From now on women occupy important positions in political, academic, cultural and economic business life. To exemplify this I only mention Margaret Thatcher, Simone de Beauvoir and Madonna.
But I do not want to give a rosy picture of how things really are. It is a fact that in everyday life men are still higher up on the social scale. For doing exactly the same job as their male colleagues, women often get paid less. The typical roles expected of women, such as staying home to take care of the children, are still taken for granted by many.
I conclude that women are still not politically equal to men, in spite of the various movements fighting for this cause. But I fear equality for all people is utopian: there will always be some who think they are superior to others.

DBAN3020,3.0,2.5,,,,,Crime does not pay,"
Everyone knows the story about Al Capone, the mob leader from Chicago and Eliot Ness, his FBI pursuer. Capone was somebody who could do everything he wanted to because he was a gangster. Ness was just an FBI-agent who had to play by the rules expounded in the law. But who won in the end? Capone was put in jail where he died and Ness became a famous person. The question at stake is: Does crime really pay, or is it true that honesty is the best policy? I'll try to prove that Ness and Capone's story is actually an exception to the rule.
My parents were always telling me and my sister not to let ourselves be led astray because if we let this happen we could end up in jail for stealing or, in the worst case, for killing someone. But is it really true what they said? If you look at the world we live in today the law just seems there to convict the petty criminals. If you have been in the business of being a gangster for some time and you own the money to bribe some high officials and even judges you're almost always home free. This way you can go on running your gang without being bothered by the law.
If you don't have the money or the connections to bribe persons in high places you re in a worse position. But if you watch the television or you read the newspapers you see that most of the time the sentences given by the judge for murder or whatever are so light you can't understand why everybody isn't going around killing everybody else.
There is another reason why for example in Belgium, criminals are released very soon from jail. We have in our country something which is called the law Lejeune. This law gives you a chance to be let of the hook when you have been in jail for one third of the time you should have been. So when you've been sentenced to thirty years in jail you can be released after ten years.
We should not only look at imprisonment, but we should also look at the money-fines because actually this is where the biggest stupidity is to be found. Imagine yourself to be a drug dealer, if you sell good stuff you've got a lot of customers so you make a nice living. When you're arrested by the police you have to pay a fine when you're in court. It could well be that this fine is about the amount of money you make in one day dealing drugs. So why should you stop dealing? It just doesn't make sense.
I think I've made it clear that our system of law doesn't work the way it should. A ganster can pay his way out of jail, a petty criminal is put in jail, but for how long? And the law Lejeune makes it even worse. And money-fines won't work anymore like they used to do. If you think about all this you might consider to start dealing drugs or doing something illegal and profitable yourself. Because crime DOES pay.

If you commit a crime, you go to jail. That is the way it is and has been for a long time. Everyone knows about the famous dungeons of the 18th and 19th century.
But since then , times have changed a lot. Thanks to modern technology most of us do no longer have to work on the land to be able to live. In stead of that, we drive to work in cars (with or without air bag), we put our dinner in the micro wave and if we have problems we can go to a psychiatrist. But if we commit a serious crime, we still go to jail.
In my opinion, the prison system is outdated indeed. Moreover, it is not even efficient: there are far too little prisons to lock up every criminal who deserves it, consequently people are released too early or they don't go to jail at all. It might even happen that innocent people get sentenced to prison. And in my opinion the worst consequence of our jail system is that no one asks WHY the crime has been committed in order to help the person who did it.
If someone, for example, does not have any money and becomes a drugdealer, you do not help this person nor society by locking him up, because when he's released he still does not have any money so he'll just continue selling drugs! Instead of being put to jail, he should be given some kind of job to be able to live. The same thing holds for someone who has often been battered when he was young: if such a person becomes a murderer, he will not stop killing after a few years of prison. People like that should be looked after by a team of psychiatrists, who can take away the roots of their problems.
A differece has to be made between someone who commits a crime because of certain circumstances(if you have serious financial or psychological problems), and someone who just wants to gain more power or money(a drug baron, for example). The latter ought to be punished, e. g. by taking away most of his money and by forcing him to work for charity for a long period. But the former should not be put in jail, in fact he shouldn't be punished at all!
On the other hand, there is a minor group of criminals that should be put away: murderers who are perfectly sane, who just get a kick out of killing people. Only these criminals are a real danger to society, while others are completely harmless if they are being looked after properly.
You might say that all this, although it sounds well, is only a theory. I realise that it is very difficult to accomplish in reality, but if the government was really willing to put money and time in such a project, it would certainly be possible to achieve. Maybe this generation won't benefit from the results yet, but our children and grandchildren will.
It is a shame that most governments still do not realise that our prison system is inefficient and outdated. Maybe they do but don't care if there are people in jail who need help instead of punishment. It might be their idea of justice but it certainly is not mine.

DBAN3023,3.0,2.0,,,,,"Some people say that in our modern world, dominated by science and technology and industrialisation, there is no longer a place for dreaming and imagination. What is your opinion?","
Science, progress, technology and industrialisation dominate our contemporary society and provide us, modern people, with comfort and wealth. We go to work by car. We live in fancy houses full of electrical novelties. Rockets bring men to the moon and even further. Every day again scientists want to improve our western standard of living. Researchers aim higher and higher. No limits exist in this materialistic world. We cannot live without our computers, remote controls, refrigerators and microwaves. Modern man eagerly swallows the products of progress.
An important consequence, of this wealth is the intellectual impoverishment of the modern man. Lots of people lead a superficial life these days. If you take away their daily TV series a expensive cars, they soon will run out of things to say In such a society there is little space left for imagination and fantasy. I think, people should react against this monotonous way of life. But we must keep the following in mind: Science has brought man as far, that it is almost impossible for us to get rid of our luxurious ways of life. As in many matters man should choose a golden mean. On the one hand he should enjoy modern comfort, but on the other hand he should not reduce himself to a member of the pure, grey mass. If modern man does not stubbornly resist the stream of advance, he will undoubtedly become a robot.
The romantic poets and philosophers of the eighteenth and nineteenth century already reacted against the Industrial Revolution. They deplored the loss of nature and the abstraction of fantasy. They had dreams of a world closer to nature and they wrote these dreams down. Wordsworth, Rousseau and others longed for returning to nature. In free nature they could express themselves freely, without overlooking the barriers of society. These men already realized that the expression of their individual dreams and feelings brought them to another world. It brought them to an inner, more beautiful world, far from the factories and the modern industry. They formed their own small worlds, which formed a block against the superficial mass.
Returning to nineteen ninety-four, I think, there are still people who have achieved a lifestyle which perfectly combines current society with their individual dreams. There are still dreamers in our world. People who believe in other people and in a better world. Society may consider them as naves, but I don't think they are. These people take the iniative. They chose for eachother. They try to make society more human, but they are aware they can not stop progress. These men and women realize that in spite of the growing superficiality of our age, people need eachother more than ever. They know that we all have to stick together to find the golden mean between science and fantasy. I also share their message : Don't deliver yourself to the grey mass. Your precious dreams will become alives, if you keep believing in them!!

DBAN3024,3.0,2.0,,,,,"Some people say that in our modern world, dominated by science and technology and industrialisation, there is no longer a place for dreaming and imagination. What is your opinion?","
People worry a lot these days. Not only about money, career and their looks, but also about the decline of some important traditional values in our modern world. Religion, for example, is said to be losing ground. Nowadays, going to church has become highly unpopular because God, the Pope and every priest have lost their function and authority. Some people ask themselves where it will end, now they have lost their leader. Also our dear old mother earth is said to be in great danger. The idea of polluted air, water and food terrifies people in such a way that it gives them an apocaliptic vision of the future. And finally there are even rumours that in our modern world, dominated by science, technology and industrialisation, there is no longer place for dreaming and imagination. Is this true or not? Well, I can't make up my mind yet. Let me first consider this suggestion in some more detail.
Indeed, we are living in the age of great progress. Everything has to go fast, the whole world undergoes a process of mechanization. And whether we like it or not , we have to follow this hectic stream of life and it influences our private lives more than we might expect. So at first sight it clearly seems to be the case that our modern way of life severely threatens our imaginative power. I think that very convincing evidence can be found in the behaviour of the children of the nineteen-nineties. Isn't it true that the child used to stand for innocence, fantasy, illusions, or in other words the unbridled imagination? To put it somewhat differently: didn't the child used to be the counterpart of the adult because the latter had lost (almost) everything I mentioned above. As jou must have noticed, I deliberately used a past tense because nowadays this prototypical child doesn't exist anymore. Children of the nineteen-nineties don't like the old fairy tales anymore. Computergames and other horrible electronic appliances, devised by high-tech industry, have become today's favourites. Toy industry also provides little boys with real cars and real motors and little girls with real kitchens and living dolls. Apparantly children needn't use their imagination anymore because their toys (devised by adults with clearly no sense of fantasy) seem so realistic. For this reason I believe that we, adults and society in general play an important role in this. It is our task to make a boy aware of the fact that a wooden car without a sofisticated engine can drive even more than a hundred and fifty m.p.h., if only he closed his eyes. And little girls should believe again in the power of their imagination which can make a rag doll walk and talk...
Next to the mechanic toys, there is another important dream- and- imagination- killer that I really can't ignore: namely television. During the last thirty years, television has gradually gained over books. Today, people have moved their collection of books to the darkest corner of their room and have given television the most central place. Of course this whole changement didn't take place without important consequences. Where reading a book stirs our imagination, watching television ruthlessly breaks it down. How can a technical object as television simply block our stream imagination? Let me clarify this. When we are reading a book, we are permanently making use of our imaginative power because we immediately visualize the sentences we are reading in our mind. But when we are watching television, this whole mental process is blocked because television visualizes everything for us. To give an example: when I was reading Tess of the D'ubervilles, I had a very clear, but imagined picture of the main character in my head. This whole imagined picture was completely destroyed when I saw the film Tess and I can tell you that I was really disappointed in the movie. Could it be a coincidence that a film-version of a book is most of the time much worse than the book itself? I don't think so. Let me end with the conclusion that television is a fearsome opponent of our imagination and we must aware of it.
A last, but nevertheless very appropiate argument that I briefly want to mention here is today's drugsproblem. It is a fact that thousands of people, especially youngsters, regularly reach for drugs and other sorts of hallucinogen. Why are they doing this? Is it an escape from the boring reality of everyday life or do we have to interprete it as an escape from our sober modern society where dreaming and imagination have lost their place?
It would be logical that my final conclusion would be: it is true that dreaming and imagination are given a marginal place in modern society. After all, all my arguments are in favour of this statement. But such a conclusion would be too radical, I think. My opion is that there is still place for the creative faculties of the mind. Only has this place become smaller. Science, industry and technology may control our lives, but we will never become robots. Dreams and imagination are a part of human life and I strongly believe that nothing or noone can ever separate them.

DBAN3027,3.5,4.0,,,,,The prison system is outdated. No civilized society should punish its criminals: it should rehabilitate them,"
If people commit crimes, society has to do something about it. one has to avoid that other people suffer under the actions of criminals. Those people have to be picked out of the mass and placed aside. And then what?
All men are determined by their genetic inheritance and their past. Everyone has his own given personality. Some people are aggressive and destructive, others are more tolerant and friendly. It's all in the genes. Through life-experiences man develops his character. If somebody is born as an aggressive individual, but receives a good education, he can learn to control this aggression. But if he is given a wrong value-system, if he grows up in an atmosphere of violence and destruction, it is almost logical and natural that he becomes a criminal. Instead of controlling this aggression, he gives in to it. So many things can go wrong when a child grows up. it is a harsh task to handle traumatic experiences without turning your anger and hate towards other people. It is also extremely difficult to change the wrong value-systems of criminals, to make, for example, a killer understand that a human life is precious and that no one has the right to take it away.
The main goal of putting criminals in jail is to make them stop committing crimes. There are two ways to achieve this. One can make criminals understand that what they did was wrong. One can also just scare them, make them see that their crimes are not worth the consequences, i.e. being put in jail, away from family and friends and deprived of their freedom.
Punishment is one way to handle criminals. Some people in jail learn to understand that their actions were indeed unacceptable. They really change inside. Their twisted value-system is corrected. others are rather impressed by the price they pay, by the way society deals with them. They are made scared. When they are released they will not commit crimes any more because the idea of returning to their cell discourages and frightens them. But they have not changed. They still believe that they can do harm, or steal or anything. A killer will not kill any more, but he still has no respect for life. There are other cases. People who easily forget and start killing, stealing and harassing again.
An other way to deal with criminals is called rehabilitation. It is an attempt to change people, to give them the right values. With other words, they are lessons in the difference between good and evil. People are told how to control aggression and hate, how to deal with their past experiences, their fears and frustrations. It is like a new education. A criminal will regret his actions, not because of the consequences, but because he will see that he has done something wrong, something one just can't and may not do.
The question is which of the two mediums is preferable. The first one, punishment, is a way of making people pay for their crimes. They did something wrong and, therefore, are punished. It is a collective revenge of society. The second medium doesn't punish criminals for what happened in the past, but it tries to give those people new values, so that in the future they can fit in society. A punishment leads only to a future of revengefulness or bitterness. Rehabilitation concentrates on the future. It brings hope and perspectives for a better life.

The country you are born in, your socio-economic status, your skin colour and your sex stipulates who you will become. Not everybody has the same prospects, because some people are considered to be more equal than others.
Countries in the southern hemisphere are in general less prosperous than countries in the northern hemisphere. These poor countries, or Third World countries, are often politically unstable and they are sometimes stricken with famine or diseases. There are only a few schools, so a lot of people never learn to write or to calculate. In the northern hemisphere, on the other hand, democracy reigns and education is compulsory. People living in these rich countries have many more opportunities to develop their minds, because they have the time and the money, while in the Third World people are trying to survive.
But even in Belgium, we speak of the Fourth World; poor people live in starvation, having problems to find a roof over their heads. Of course, our country has its Social Security Offices, but poverty is not only a financial problem. It is an accumulation of side effects such as alcoholism, illiteracy, a feeling of guilt and of shame for the situation. Poor people of ten do not have the courage to break out of that vicious circle. Poverty brings about an indifferent view on society. The poor are outcasts, ignored and oppressed by the rich, the ones who are more equal than others.
All over the world people are being discriminated against because of their skin colour. In some countries coloured people cannot go where they would like to go, they cannot live where they would want to live. This discrimination is usually based on prejudices. When a country goes through an economic crisis, people need a scapegoat. So the coloured people are blamed for unemployment, the formation of gangs and increasing criminality. They are dominated by the white, the ones more equal than others.
Some people may think that nowadays men and women have equal rights, but they are wrong. Whether you are born as a boy or a girl determines the rest of your life to a great extent. Some oldfashioned and short-sighted parents believe that their daughters should not continue their studies after finishing secondary school. Many people still believe that girls grow up to cook and sew and become good housewives. When a man and a woman apply for the same job, the employer is more likely to choose the male applicant, especially when an important position is concerned. Also in our use of words this discrimination is visible. Some people do speak about the second sex. Men are pulling the strings.
It is clear that the world we are living in is seen as a world where the white, the male and the rich are privileged. The others have a second-rate position. But every individual has his own talents. Some are highly gifted while others have less abilities.
It is a fact that everybody is different, but it is a shame that, therefore, people are not treated equally.

DBAN3030,3.0,2.5,,,,,All armies should consist entirely of professional soldiers: there is no value in a system of military service,"
The protest singer Donovan wrote in his song ""The Universal Soldier"" :...

I think he's right. The question is not wether an army should consist of professional soldiers or National Servicemen, but wether there should be soldiers at all.
An army as a military unit, as a ""force to defend a country against inroads of hostile countries"" is, analogous to legal self defence, morally justifiable. But it is untenable to keep defending this proposition in view of modern weapon equipment and the consequences a war can have. International conflicts should be solved by negociations and not by warfare. So an army in this sense is an unforgivable waste of money. This money could better be spent for diplomatic negociations with the ""enemy"".
But an army as an institute to come into operation in emergency situations like floods, earth quakes, volcanic eruptions,... is probably very useful. The army can then be considered as an institute next to the police and the fire brigade. Here I would plead for an army -or should we call it an ""emergency brigade"" or ""community @service""?- consisting partly of professional ""soldiers"" and partly of ""National Servicemen"". Because modern society tends to become too individualistic. The ""res publica"" is considered a slave of personal concerns and not a guardian of the common good. So it would be a good thing to call up every eighteen year old to join this ""emergency brigade"".
But of course we are not that far yet. Soldiers are still trained to fight. As long as this is the reality an army should in this sense too consist partly of professional soldiers and partly of National servicemen. Because the answer to the question ""Who will join the army when national service isn't a duty anymore?"" will be something like: A selected group of people who like to handle with weapons. To put it briefly: a group of machos."" Such an army, a professional one, very soon becomes a world on its own, a world you can not control anymore. The army so easily becomes the ultimate power in being. To prevent loss of control over the army there should be compulsary military service. Because the fear of a coup d'tat and the like is much smaller when there are National Servicemen in the army.
Of course there has to be the possibility to refuse duty. There must be an alternative like for example joining the Voluntary Service Overseas.
So I can not agree with the decision made in Belgium a year and a half ago to abolish national service. The last draft is now in service. So very soon there will be a professional army in Belgium.

Some people say that in our modern world, dominated by science technology and industrialisation, there is no longer a place for dreaming, and imagination.
I'm aware of a tendency nowadays which confirms this statement. However, generalising the matter seems dangerous to me. First, I take for granted that some persons deliver themselves instinctively more to their imagination than other. Secondly, everybody doesn't react to our modern society in the same way. Education, religion, sex and the character we are born with are important in these matters.
Dreaming, in the meaning of having experiences in the mind while asleep, is timeless and universal. Hence, all people cope with some sort of imagination, whether they like it or not.
The odd modern person is forced to live in a society which is regulated by technology and industrialisation. Modern men are overran by publicity, videoclips, news reports etc. This stream of information is often a root of evil. Trying to deal with it properly seems to have rather a numbing than an enriching effect on the whole line. Swallowing every day ready-made-images can also lead to the habit of giving in to your own dreamworld. To escape from the structured working life, we like to drown ourselves in a private world of thoughts and imagination, almost as a deed of protest. Sometimes it even results in becoming an unwordly dreamer.
Modern technology doesn't make it easier. Becoming more and more sophisticated, it prevents people to grasp the underlying system of it. Everybody knows for example a computer and simply learns how to use him, without realising what happens exactly. Nowadays, only a genius is able to understand our modern tools and consequently, to have them partly in control. What I want to point out is that this technological evolution has a disturbing effect on imagination and fantasy. Most people haven't got a clue how far this evolution has already gone and where it will end. They can't ""imagine"", it's beyond their reach. To put it in an extreme way, free imagination is imprisoned by modem technology because the latter seems to make everything possible. Publicity slogans making promises to fulfill all your wishes may illustrate this ironically.
I think that every person, depending of his character, has to give his imagination and dreams a chance to exist. Most of all, people should try to realise the state of our world, its progression and its decline. There's no point in becoming a lonely rebel or a romantic soul. Imagination and all other basic human values should fit in our evolution, wherever this may end.

DBAN3032,3.0,2.0,,,,,Feminists have done more harm to the cause of women than good,"
A very long time ago God created the first woman out of the man. Throughout the history of mankind there has always been a certain inequality between the male and the female sex.
The husband has always been the worker, the breadwinner of the family and the wife has to bring his shoes, make his dinner and be quiet. Women have been controlled by their husbands for ages. Not only regarding their position in a family, but more generally, concerning their social, economic and cultural status women are put down by a male society. For a long time they had no right to vote, wages were not equal (even at this moment they're not) and in some times women, who had literairy capacities, used a male pseudonym to make their work acceptable. Like all abuses, at a certain moment, they were reacted against. That's why we know the concept of feminism, a reaction against the male dominion, or maybe better, an attempt to equalize the position of men and women in our modern society. Even today we might say the female sex is still often discriminated and -as every degree of discrimination is reprehensible- it is understandable that some people react against it.
As long as these reactions do not result in fundamentalism, as we often see happen in politics and religion. We still recall the death threat towards Salman Rushdie after publishing his ""Satanic Verses""; this is a result of a very forced through, fundamentalistic point of view which doesn't ameliorate the case they believe in; on the contrary they misrepresent their religious institute towards the outside world.
At this level any form of idealism is contemptuous and doesn't express the ideas they're holding on to.
Now, as I said, a reaction against an abuse is a good one, but a grouping in which a leader misuses his responsibility and his power is a bad one. Communication is a keyword in every organisation and anyone who can make decisions should be aware of the pros and contras every decision can bring about.
Now regarding feminism I think feminists should be aware of the fact that a man is not a woman and vice versa. Maybe I sound as if feminists don't know, but sometimes you get the impression they don't. Total equality on every position cannot be realised. But this doesn't exclude that everyone should have the same rights and the same chances in society. If not, a rational reaction is desirable; any exaggerated reaction will not solve a thing, though.

Some people say that in our modern world, dominated by science technology and industrialisation, there is no longer a place for dreaming and imagination. Well, I pity those people who share this opinion. I'm certainly not one of them and I believe many others aren't either.
The strongest argument to prove my words is that in order to create all these new technological inventions, an enormous amount of imagination is required. Wasn't it Einstein who said that imagination is more important than knowledge? Every inventor starts with a dream: in his mind he sees the new concept coming alive. He explores every possible way worth following in order to work out his idea. Finally he must come to a conclusion, which will astonish the world.
Imagine our lives without the products of the industrial revolution. Thank God someone had the luminous idea to build steam-engines to keep us all warm in winter. (Thank You, God, for having the idea to create us).
Apart from this, our modern world has indeed become very hectic. In order to survive, mankind must use all his imagination. Everyone needs a few hours strictly for himself every now and then. Most of us would go insane without our ow@n, personal aspiration s. If today has been a complete disaster, one can always dream about a lovely tomorrow. We all make plans for our future and we must keep on dreaming about a better day to come.
But then again, what if all your dreams have been scattered? For some people tomorrow will remain a nightmare. What can I say? Hang on to that one, tiny, divine spark? This must sound like some cruel joke to a Sudanese child. I know, in our comfortable world everything is so much easier. If I've had a lousy day, I take a hot bath and listen to my favourite music, which makes me always feel better. I may have lost a few dreams on the way (haven't we all?), but I still cherish a bunch of them ""in a heart-shaped box"".
This modern world hasn't lacked to give birth to so many poets, musicians, writers, painters, philosophers, dancers, ... The Muses are still alive among us. Every historical period has its own way of thinking and expressing itself. This twentieth century has developped its share of oddities: cubism, fauvism, op-art, pop-art, conceptual art, grunge, ... There's no need to like it or even to understand it, it's today's spirit. ""Art moves, shit happens"", remember?).
Now that the century is drawing to its end, we can look back with a smile, anger or even fear for what is still to come. Sadly enough Hiroshima and Hitler were NOT just our imagination. This age has also shown its darkest, sickest side. Even the divine faculty of imagination is able to produce horror. It's useless to separate good and evil from eachother: Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde came to a sad end.
So never say that our modern world hasn't shown any imagination. Traces of it are all around us: we ought to face the results of the past. It's a relief to awaken from a bad dream, but ""imagine"" another time, another place. Well, as John Lennon said: , I hope many others will join his dreaming.
My advice: use a little imagination and the world will be a much nicer place to live in.

DBAN3034,3.0,2.5,,,,,Feminists have done more harm to the cause of women than good,"
It should be noted that one can be a feminist without feeling affinity for the wave of feminist ideas from the sixties upto now. In expressing their ideas through the years about equal rights for women, the feminists forgot the most important points: the basic principles and the basic differences between women and men. Feminists were so eager for result that they diregarded these basic points.
The basic principles of feminism, the things that are really important for women to achieve are equal wages for equal work, equal possibilities in education and upbringing and excellent crches and nursery schools. As long as these principles have not been attained, time must not be wasted on other, less important things. But as this is hard, unpleasant and unrewarding work, women prefer to sit down and chat about how 'bad' men are instead of working on these socio-economic injustices.
With many feminists one recognizes a certain intolerance for people not agreeing with their ideas. But, as said before, one can be a feminist without agreeing with the ideas of the mass of feminists. A lot of the present feminism is modern preaching of what is permitted and what is not. If some women stay home and look after the children rather than go out into the hard life of business, they should be able to. Isn't it the right of every man or woman to be what he or she wants to be? Feminism mustn't put pressure on women. The present tendency is that a woman should be ashamed of preferring to stay home. The pressure before feminism () has now turned into a pressure the other way around.
This is not to say it was better before. The good thing about feminism is that it gives women the courage to have an own identity. They can have own lives now. A woman is no longer dependent on a man.
That women should be represented in parliament is in itself a good idea. But they shouldn't be forced into it. If there are few women in parliament now, it partly depends on the fact that they are not ready for it yet. They will get there eventually.
In a marriage the partners should give each other the freedom to have their own lives. For a man to give his wife this possibility, he does not need feminism. This freedom of choice should be the basic idea of marriage.
In this discussion the feminists forgot something else, the basic differences between women and men. In Dutch this is nicely expressed in the words  and .  relates to laws and wages etc. In that respect man and women are equal.  has to do with the fact that men and women will never be the same. In this way men and women are not equal.
The conclusion is that women should be able to choose and decide what they like best. They shouldn't be obstructed in any way. And perhaps we should let men be able to choose too?

DBAN3035,3.5,3.5,3.0,4.0,3.5,4.0,"In his novel ""Animal Farm"" George Orwell wrote ""All men are equal but some are more equal than others"". How true is this today?","
In his book 'Animal Farm' Orwell says that some people are more equal than other people, but he not only says so. In his book '1984' he shows us the necessity of the inequality of the human race. In '1984' social inequality is one of the main bilding blocks of the ""good"" ordered society Winston Smith lifes in. Also Huxley wrote in his book 'A brave new world' about a society where people weren't equal at all, and still he writes ""The world is steady now. Safe and steady. People are happy."" And even though these books tell us the story of people who react against the entire system, seen from an objective point of view these societies work out, wether they respect the human race or not.
These two extremes can be seen as a characterization of our whole society. Social inequality is there, always has been there, and probably will always be there. During history you always had people who were less than other people, people who suffered, and people who had to fight for there rights but never got them. And on the other hand you had the ones who ruled the world and who were just more equal than the others.
One might of course object against the fact that when things are already what they are for a long time, they have to stay like that. But that's just the strange thing about this ""being equal thing."" The need for power, the need to feel and to be more equal than the others just seems to be one of the main human aims. This was shown in history more than once. During the Frech revolution the ones that felt oppressed reacted against the King and the Aristocracy. But once they got some power they started to act just the same as their predecessors: oppressing and neglecting the ones who were of no importance for there ruling position. Give one who is certainly ""the most less equal"" of all human beings all the power in the world, and he probably won't be thinking of his fellow unequal friends any more. He'll just think of how to extend his own power and how to become ""the most equal of the world."" It isn't honnest that some people are less than others, but history shows us that people always maintained this enequality. And wether they did this on purpose or not, they did it nevertheless.
Maybe this social inequality is necessary to keep our society going. People need to have a certain aim in there lifes, they need to have something to fight for. Social inequality gives them such an aim. The poor will try to become rich, the rich ones will try to become richer, and the richer will probably try to become very very very rich. What would people do if they were all equal and had nothing to struggle for?
Social equality is the dream of every starry-eyed idealist (or maybe of every human being). Somewhere in a certain time and at a certain place such an idealist tried to build up a society where everybody was equal. (Wasn't it in the U.S.S.R. or someplace like that...?) I Don't know exactly what went wrong with his Utopia, but I certainly know it went wrong one moment or the other... This example just to show that the realization of the big equality dream didn't work out either.
Winston Smith in '1984' says that he knows HOW it all happens, but he doesn't understand WHY it all happens. And this is just the same for me. Social inequality has always been there, and men don't seem to be in the possibility to solve this (BIG) problem. I also would like to see a society where no-one has to feel less and everybody has equal powers... But that seems to be a dream that only the starry-eyed idealist can realize in his thoughts. Generations and generations of people have been fighting against it and it seems we just have to resigne to the whole situation. And just like Winston Smith most of us understand HOW but don't understand the WHY of it all, and the answer to this question would probably lead us to equality.

DBAN3037,4.0,3.5,,,,,"Some people say that in our modern world, dominated by science and technology and industrialisation, there is no longer a place for dreaming and imagination. What is your opinion?","
Our society is said to be severely influenced by technology. Nowadays this influence is becoming so big that there is no longer a place for dreaming and imagination. This is mainly due to the fact that new technologies, such as virtual reality and interactive television, are being developped irresponsibly. With all this new technology, man does no longer have to think for himself, everything is done for him. You could say that these developments are all very good for mankind, but the problem is that man does no longer think, period.
In the 19th and the beginning of the 20th century, people had to work so hard, just to keep themselves and their families alive, that there was no time left for dreaming or imagination. But then came technology, because of machines the work became much lighter, people could go on holiday once in a while and had plenty of time to fantasize and dream. In this respect technology has been a blessing for mankind. However this 'blessing' has now taken on such proportions that for some people it becomes almost impossible to think and dream freely. Technology can be used to stimulate people, to make them form their own opinions, but all too often it is used to impose the opinions and convictions of the people who are in control, on people who are using the technology. From this viewpoint our world is beginning to resemble the worl that Orwell described in ""1984"", a society that is controlled by a few people who have all the means to manipulate other people in such a way that creativity and fantasy become impossible. If however our technology and media are used in a responsible, ""well thoughout"" manner, they will stimulate people to think, give them time to do something else than make money, so that free imagination and dreaming become possible.
There is a second danger connected with this technology. Nowadays it is becoming so strong that you can create your own personal reality with it (the so-called 'virtual reality' technology). This means that people can create their private universe, in which they control everything, with a computer. This 'virtual reality' gives so much power to fantasy and imagination that it can become very confusing. The user of this technology could take this fictive world for the real world and suffer a severe shock when he's brought back into the reality, and even worse, he could decide to live the most important part of his life in this 'fictive' reality and live the life of a vegetable in our reality.
In short one could say that technology has certainly been a blessing for mankind. There should, however, be some control on it, too often man is abused by technology. It's high time to do something about the morbid growth of technology and to try and seek for a system that protects society and its members.

DBAN3038,3.5,3.5,,,,,"In his novel ""Animal Farm"" George Orwell wrote ""All men are equal but some are more equal than others"". How true is this today?","
Most people think that all men should get the same chances and should be treated equally. Or rather, they are convinced that they think this way, because society has always told them to do so. Unfortunately, man doesn't seem to be made like that. If no one can catch you out, you will always try to get the best for yourself or at best for the ones you love the most.
When we say then that all men are equal, we actually mean those men that resemble us, that are not too different from us. Others are seen as no real men. This is the way we solve the contradiction between our morals and our instincts.
Ofcourse, no one will easily admit that he treats some men as if they were more equal than others. But if all men thought about equality like they say they do, it would be possible to establish a society where everybody was equal. When we look at society, though, it's obvious that in our heart of hearts we think of ourselves as still a bit more equal than others.
If we look at this problem on a worldscale, we'll find that there is an enormous gap between different countries. Up North, people are on the whole incredibly rich and can't even imagine the poverty of the South. If the northern hemisphere really experienced these differences as injust, it would be able to help the South out of this mess. But many among us are too scared of being put at a disadvantage and are salving their conscience by saying : 'Those are not men like we are : we are working hard for our money, while they are so lousy!' Or in other words : 'All men are equal, but those are no real men.'
All over the world people are being discriminated against because they are different. This difference seems to justify the way they are treated. 'That man has got a different skin colour. He's black, so he doesn't belong here. He hasn't got the same right to be here as we have. If he nevertheless stays, he should be satisfied with what he gets.' Are all men equal? Well yes, all white men are equal.
'That woman has got different cultural habits : she's always wearing long clothes and a headscarf. If she wants to be treated equally, she should behave like everybody does.' The contradiction in this proposition is obvious. If she has to adopt our culture, she's already being discriminated against, since we are allowed to live according to our own culture and she is not. We always find excuses to treat ourselves better than our fellow men. And if, to find excuses, we have to deceive ourselves, we will.
I admit that I have painted white and rich people rather negatively in what preceded. I did this, because, in my opinion, we are guilty of a tremendous egoism. This doesn't mean that the ones who are victim here, won't try to get the best for themselves, their friends and families too. In this respect we are indeed all equal. But nowadays more and more people realize that this egoism is in their nature. The more we realize this, the more we can react against it and try to make all men equal. All people are different, but I'm not indifferent to the fact that some are treated differently.

DBAN3040,3.5,3.5,,,,,All armies should consist entirely of professional soldiers: there is no value in a system of military service,"
This year, the last ""victims"" of the military service system in Belgium were conscripted into the army. These boys formed a remnant of a system which has been part of Belgium society for a very long time.
It's certainly a lost tradition and I can understand that some people regret this loss. But in my opinion, there are more disadvantages than advantages connected with such a system. ""In the army, you become a MAN"" is an argument which is sometimes used by people who want to maintain the whole system. This isn't true, I think. You don't have to go into the army to become a Man!
Of course I am looking at this from a feminine point of view and I can only judge from what I hear and read. But I always wondered why girls weren't included in the military service. After all, that isn't so unimaginable. There are countries where also women are obliged to do service. In Israel for example, two or three years of national service are due. An army that consists of professional soldiers only, offers more opportunities for women to make a career for themselves in the army, I think. As far as I am concerned, I can imagine myself as a soldier very easily. Why not?
In my point of view, professionals can also be trained better, since there is much more time to do so. More skilled soldiers will improve the quality of an army and that is very important in emergency situations. Of course, it would be nice if an army wasn't necessary at all. But we all know that this is a dream. We need an army, even if it were only to give the people a feeling of safety. And not only in warsituations an army is useful. Soldiers can help when parts of the country are flooded, they can relieve the tasks of the police in all sorts of manifestations and demonstrations,...
The Belgian army is already known for its efficiency in foreign countries and this reputation can only be improved. And there is the added advantage that professional soldiers have volunteered to take the risk of having to fight. They know they can be send abroad for a dangerous mission at any time. It's part of their job. If you're not prepared to take this risk, you don't join the army.
But to me, the most important argument for the statement that an army should consist of professional soldiers only, is that the country has at it's disposal a highly motivated army. All these people are there out of their own free wsill. They want to be a soldier. That is the big difference in comparison with all those young men who can't wait to be discharged and serve their country just because they have to.
I think the Belgian government has done a great thing in abolishing concription and considering the big burden of debt this country is in, it will be an important money-saver too.

DBAN3042,3.0,3.0,,,,,"In the words of the old song: ""Money is the root of all evil""","
It has been said before that money is the root of all evil. Surely not all evil is due to money, but the far-reaching harm that is being done to individuals in our world has to be attributed to capitalism. The system has undoubtedly influenced human behaviour at the end of this millennium: capitalism has added greatly to the all encompassing paralysis of the world. This essay focuses not only on the influence of capitalism on the individual, but also on the artist and on art itself.
In the closing years of the 20th century the individual person finds himself surrounded by unnecessary misery and gross inequality. Our community does not take the individuals integrity into account. According to Ludien Goldman, a famous literary critic, it was the so-called new look capitalism that killed the intrinsic value of the individual. When at the beginning of this century the capital concentrated itself around a select number of entrepreneurs, the free trade turned into an economy of monopolies and trusts. In this new economic sustem, the individual had lost its central position. Unlike the 19th century liberalism, the new look capitalism did not allow individuals to take part in big business. As a result, passivity grew.
Consumption is one of the key-words in the capitalists dictionary. People are urged in various ways to buy products that can improve their standard of living, so that after a while those redundant products become indispensable. Riches alone make no man happy, although we live in a world in which wealth seems to be the initial goal of life. Consequently, a lot of people are blinded by the considerations of career and personal profit.
Now how does capitalism affect the artist? The artist, too, is an individual and for that reason has to be protected. He must be given full spatio-temporal freedom to exploit his creativity and genius in order to produce Art. The artist must keep his independency, although he is still part of a society - whether he likes it or not. This society however may not prevent him from expressing his thoughts freely and making hiw own choices.
Theoretically, capitalism gives people this freedom to choose. I have to disagree with this definition. This is the kind of statement that implies that the homeless in e.g. New York City are somehow being homeless of their own volition. In the capitalist system, if you have no money, you have no choice, and capitalism defines freedom as choice.
To conclude this short essay, I'll briefly touch upon the capitalist view of the relationship between art and commerce. I will not discuss the contents of Art. The central simplicity of capitalism is that if something makes a profit then it must be good. This kind of reasoning may do when we talk about hamburgers, or refrigerators, but not when we discuss art. Hundreds of books have been written on the criterions for art, but it is sure that sales potential can never be the sole criterion for art. Therefore I say that capitalism is threatening Art.

DBAN3044,3.5,3.0,,,,,All armies should consist entirely of professional soldiers: there is no value in a system of military service,"
Left, right, left, right, left, right, left, right, left. That's what you hear when you find yourself at an army base at six or seven o'clock in the morning. Brave soldiers marching on with all the same look on their faces. But what's really behind their looks?
In most countries armies consists of soldiers who are in the army because they have to. They have no choice. When they have reached a certain age they get a letter from the government. In that letter the government tells them they have reached the age to take up a training to become a soldier. If they want to or not, that doesn't really matter. They're just to do what they're told and certainly mustn't ask too many questions.
We should ask ourselves the question if this is the best way to recruit young men for the army. If you make up two lists with on one the advantages and on the other the disadvantages the second list is usually much longer. We'll have a look at the main objections.
There is however one advantage we should look at first. With a system like this there won't be any difficulties to have enough recruits. If the army needs 200 candidates they just make an arbitrary selection and they've got their 200 candidates. In that way a country is sure it will have enough soldiers to protect itself against a possible enemy. But in our modern society we'll never need soldiers like they needed them in the two world wars. If there should ever come a third world war one bomb will solve anything.
Most countries like their inhabitants to believe they live in a real democracy. But where is their precious democracy when they make people do something they don't like or want? When you at least give the recruits the possibility to refuse you get an army with only motivated members and not a group of boys just trying to be soldiers against their will. Most of them don't want to be there at all. In most cases they've already found themselves a job or they're in the middle of their studies. But that's not the only thing. There is an ethical question too. Is it really ethical to force people to learn how to kill other human beings? We could go on asking questions like this, but we've covered the most important ones.
It was said earlier that with this system there is never a shortage of soldiers. But are these soldiers really good soldiers? They learn things they only have to know for a short time. When their trainingsprogramme is finished they'll probably never need that knowledge again. What's the use of training them then? It's a waste of time and money. And that time and money should be spent on people who are motivated.
One of the most realistic solutions is the alternative of a professional army. The army then consists of soldiers who have really chosen to be one. They are eager to learn and are willing to give the best of themselves to become a great soldier. They have only one goal: to protect their countries against possible enemies. If they in fact can protect their country or if that's really necessary are other questions.
An other solution would be to have no armies at all. if people would learn to be more reasonable and more civil a lot of fights and disputes could be avoided. But people like to create problems and to make life complicated. To live in peace and harmony is probably too dull for them. But I 'd rather live a dull life than to get killed in some stupid war.

DBAN3046,4.0,3.0,,,,,Crime does not pay,"
Crime does not pay. This is a statement a lot of people have in common. The question is : Does this actually apply in reality ?
Before tackling this problem you must keep in mind that crime is increasing in our Western society. In the United States the number of prison inmates has exceeded one million ! And in order to look at the matter more closely it is necessary to give extreme examples. That is why the issue of crime in the U.S. and Russia will be discussed.
In the U.S. every major city has an immense task in dealing with the rising crime rate. Crime is the highest in the ghetto's where mainly the minority groups live. Minor and capital offences are rampant. People step beyond the boundaries of the law because they see no future for themselves. Born in poverty they'll soon realize that there' s hardly any prospect for a decent job. Because most children have no real family life, they will try to find a surrogate in a gang. It is there where the adolescents will be introduced in the world of crime and violence. And in a country where the concept of having money is almost synonymous with happiness and success in life the "" home boys "" will choose the easiest way to obtain wealth. They' ll make more money with stealing or dealing drugs than they would earn with a normal job. By the time the gang members are eighteen years old they'll have criminal records. Prison life will have no secrets for them. They may have money for a while, but their life expectancy is very low. Many die before the age of twenty. It's a vicious circle of which there is no escape.
Since the disintegration of the Soviet Union a very different kind of crime has emerged in Russia. Organized crime has become an immense problem. In this situation crime apparently does pay, for the people in charge that is. These organized groups of criminals run their illegal operations as manager's would their companies. They leave the dirty work to the "" small fish "" who regularly get into gun fights with the authorities while they themselves reap the profits. After the money has been laundered by banks it is transfered to financial paradises. Foreign investors must pay off the Russian maffia if they want to keep their companies running. Managers are hiring small private armies to protect themselves, their families and firms. There is even evidence that these groups are attempting to set up base in cities like London ! They want to infiltrate the bank sector by buying shares so that money will be easier transferable. It is obvious that none of this is possible without an enormous amount of power and money.
There is also a way to profit from crime after it has been commited.
Serial murderers in the U.S. have made quite a bit of money. How, you may ask ? They sell their paintings !
These sort of actions are not necessarily restricted to criminals. It' s hard to believe that some of the rejected jurors in the pending O. J. Simpson case are appearing free of charge in talkshows.
Crime has always been a regrettable part of every society on earth. Thinking such a problem will simply go away is not realistic. But that doesn't mean that nothing has to be done about it. If there's going to be a world without crime society will have to change at it's foundations. Further reflection would lead to a whole different story and I will leave that to the philosophers. What I can offer, is some hope. Hope for a world without crime.

DBAN3047,3.5,4.0,,,,,"In his novel ""Animal Farm"" George Orwell wrote ""All men are equal but some are more equal than others"". How true is this today?","
Equality in its widest sense can't be put forward as a typically human characteristic. If we compare two persons, we will always find some differences. Especially in these days with the fast progress scientists are making in biotechnology, we learn that all humans are genetically, psychologically, physically and characteristically different. Therefore, equality as such can't be seen as an intrinsic quality of mankind.
I think that Orwell's idea of equality is closely linked with an idea of equity and justice. There has to be a form of equity that acknowledges that every individual has a right to the same opportunities. Justice means that everybody should have the same rights and should live according to a general law. This form of equality, which is more politically and morally orientated, I consider as a more extrinsic factor to which each individual has to live up to.
The fact that all men are intrinsically unequal often interferes with the want for an ""extrinsic equality"". The position of women in our society is a good illustration of that fact. Women are, undeniably, intrinsically different from men. This difference has been the reason for men to consider women extrinsically inferior. And this male chauvinism still exists. If we compare the wages of a male and a female employee, we'll often see that the latter doesn't earn as much as her male colleague.
Another example is communism that, as a belief in an ""extrinsic equality"", led to a totalitarian state. The reason for this is that once a few people got the power, their belief in an equal community got lost in their greed for power and in their lust to exploit the ""intrinsic unequality"". And even today, if you turn on the news, you'll hear about corruption on all levels of our complex state structure.
Corruption in order to get more power or in order to keep the power. Power makes people blind to social injustice and insensible to unselfish solidarity. There's a decay in moral values because of the fact that self-interest dominates the communal interests, at all costs! Which means that everything can be bought regardless of the consequences, without ethical restraint.
If you're ambitious enough, and you have the money and the knowledge, you can buy yourself a career.
Admittedly, I'm in no position to condamn ambition; bearing in mind that studying at university sort of implies aiming higher than Jack Everybody. But, as idealistic as it might seem, I have resolved not to strive for a dazzling career, not to put all moral values aside. I believe that everybody should try to find a balance between individual ambition and communal interests. If more politicians were civilized enough to put aside their instinctive lust for power, and willing to come up for a fairer society, there wouldn't be so much distrust and indifference towards the political scene.
The principles of equality in our governmental system are very disputable. Democracy as such has become a faade behind which an ""elected lite"" plays a game of prestige and pretences. Personally speaking, I don't know how to change things. But I know that first and foremost the change has to be a mental one rather than a political one. This last statement is also the reason why a right-wing political party, like the 'Vlaams Blok', can't bring about the political change we need. Their mentality is, on the contrary, a danger to the ideal of an extrinsically equal society. Therefore, I believe that tolerance or rather comprehension of the ""intrinsic unequality"" would be a step forward in the achievement of a society without ethnic conflicts.
I think that indeed all people are intrinsically unequal, but all people should be committed to a belief in an ""extrinsic equality"".

It is becoming a modern tendency to point out the growing loss of imagination in our modern society. Some doom prophets even go as far as affirming it 'the beginning of the end'. But, are we really collapsing under the weight of our own created inventions (or should we see them as auto-destruct mechanisms), such as science technology and the world of industrialisation?
To answer this question, I think we must look at the matter from multiple angles. It is indeed true that technology created/creates a whole new world of thinking, but that it would ipso facto deprive us of our imagination is really overstating it a bit.
If we want an answer on whether this feeling of malaise is true, we should compare our periods to others (that are said to have had more panache and imagination). If we do exactly that, than it is not so hard to notice that for instance literature is not only losing its vivid imagination nowadays (postmodernism), but is moreover on the verge of becoming an elitist hobby. What is so different then between the 'good old days' and 'nowadays'? Well, I think it involves two basic facts. Primo, when the genre was created, it held tons of possibilities and many literary writers exploited and added something to this genre. Nowadays, writers feel that a lot of work has been done already and they find it hard to innovate it. Let's not forget that the novel exists as long as almost three hundred years, and that it is indeed hard to find new original (that's what literature is all about) material. Someone might add that they could as other writers have attempted catch the spirit of their time.
This leads to our second observation: how can you describe a world that offers material comfort to its inhabitants? You understand I'm talking of the major part of the Western world. Things like poverty, and the diseases of our age are very easily covered and few writers even try these subjects because even in literature we like to talk about the things w experience, the things w@d see. This means that writers find it hard to play with their imagination on the small amoebic world that is ours.
This sounds very depressing but what I would like to point out is that this amoebic, lethargical world needn't be an obstruction for the (literary) imagination. My greatest example in this matter is the writer Franz Kafka. He had the most boring life (a nine-to-five-job) and a boring world to live in. Yet what he did, was write the most amazing stories one could ever read with a diversity that has never been surpassed. What I' m trying to make clear is that writing is always opening new doors and that despite the technology and television-culture, there are always a few minds working creative and using some of there imagination. Like in Kafka's days the world offers not to much to phantasize about, but imagination and phantasy is something related to individuality.
It is a fact that, in general people, have lost/are losing a lot of their imagination, due to the television in particular and technology in general, but some people must have some left. How else have we begotten this industrialised and technological world? How come we expand and keep creating new things, or new inventions?
so, as a conclusion, our society has perhaps lost some imagination in general, but creative minds still exist.
And what of the future?
Only time can tell ...

DBAN3049,3.5,3.0,,,,,The prison system is outdated. No civilized society should punish its criminals: it should rehabilitate them,"
I chose this subject because I recently saw a very intriguing documentary on it. A child had been murdered. The defence claimed that the offender was not responsible for his deeds. The family reacted bitterly. ""Our son has got the death-penalty, we have got a lifelong sentence and the murderer can be released anytime.""
In the traditional jurisdiction a distinction is made between those who weren't fully responsible for their actions and those who were. The first are surrounded by psychiatrists who will try to rehabilitate them. The latter are punished and sent to prison. This system has indeed proved to be outdated. For an ex-prisoner the reintegration in normal society is very difficult. Many of them will even commit the same crimes over and over again.
This is, however, no reason to forget about the punishment. That wouldn't be realistic at all. A combination of the two factors (punishment and rehabilitation) should provide us with a better and more realistic approach to the problem. Some systems are already being worked out and tried out in different countries.
In some states of America, young criminals are sent to military training camps. They undergo a severe training. The principle is easy: teach the kids humility and respect, perseverence and obedience. But what about moral values? When they aren't taught the difference between wrong and right, such a training could be very dangerous and could even have the reverse effect.
A second method to try to rehabilitate criminals is to confront them with the results of their actions. They'll have to meet people who suffer from these actions: a wounded victim, the family of a murdered victim... This should make them realize what they've done and prevent them from doing it again. I think that this is a reasonable proposition, providing that 'the other party' fully agrees with it. It could even be meaningfull for the victims themselves. They could lose their fright and perhaps their anger too.
A third proposal deals with an alternative punishment. This punishment should be a constructive one and it should be related to the crime. Someone who caused an accident while violating the speed limit will have to work in a hospital. He will be confronted with victims of traffic accidents. Young people who soil property will have to clean it themselves. This sort of sentences requires a change of mentality. The traditional prison sentence is often still seen as the only 'rightful' sentence. On the other hand it is only preferable for minor offences. What to do with murder-cases or repeated crimes still remains an open question.
It is unrealistic to think we can create the ideal 'crime-repression' system. However, some changes should be made though to the traditional system. This is only possible on the basis creativity, insight and mentality. In this process we will have to find a balance between punishment and rehabilitation.

DBAN3050,3.0,2.5,,,,,Feminists have done more harm to the cause of women than good,"
Feminism is the political belief that women should have the same rights, power and opportunities that men have. The women's movement wants to improve the situation of women in political, economic, social and cultural respects. In these fields women have always been discriminated against .
Besides historical periods in which the position of women was relatively good, as in ancient Egypt and Rome, there were periods in which their situation was moderate or even bad, as in ancient Greece. During the Renaissance women led a comparitively good life and they were given a freer hand. From then on we see woman's position worsen.
In the eighteenth and nineteenth century the rich woman was forced to stay home doing really nothing, while the lower class woman had to work her fingers to the bone for little money. In this climate the first feminist protest was born.
If we compare the position of a woman in 1994 to that of her nineteenth century counterpart, we can conclude that feminists have already taken quite a step on the long way towards emancipation.
Today the right to vote seems self-evident to us. If women were disfranchised (almost) everybody would scream blue murder. Nevertheless, suffrage for women is a relatively recent phenomenon. In Britain women were given the vote for the first time in 1928 and the Belgian women could enter their votes only after the Second World War. In America, which did not used to be renowned as particularly kind to blacks, black men could go to the polls before white women enjoyed that same right. And countries like Belgium and the United States claimed to be democracies ...
In spite of obtaining suffrage, women's contribution to the political life has stayed strikingly more modest than men's. Yet we can see an evolution in the good direction. More and more political parties try to have an equal number of male and female candidates on their lists. Also the number of elected women seems to be increasing.
Emancipation of women needs more than changing laws. Feminists also react against behaviour patterns that continue the discrimination against women. They try to get rid of the steretoype of the woman as a mother, housewife and sex object.
The ideas of feminism are winning ground. Nowadays a lot of men take responsibility in the upbringing of the children and in the household.
Feminists have done a lot of good to the cause of women. But when I see how women are 'abused' in publicity for water, soap, aspirins, light products and cars for big fellows, I think there is still a long way to go.

Is there, in this century of growing technology, routine and steadfast deadlines, still some place left for imagination ? In other words, does our fast and industrialised society really influence the young generation's capacity of ""fabricating images"" in their minds, of creating a (totally) new and inexisting world for themselves ? I would rephrase it like that, because in my opinion, imagination finds its roots and possibilities of developement in the years of childhood.
I do think our technological society has a negative influence on children in that respect, but I don't consider the situation as completely hopeless. Luckily, there are still exceptions.
The regression of imagination shows in the kind of toys children (would like to) have. I would put it even stronger: modern toys to a great extend cause this impoverishment of creativity. Take for example the much desired Nintendo video games. You get a whole visual reality prefabricated for you ; you needn't invent anything yourself ! The same thing goes for (a. o.) those extensive plastic motorways, imitating the real car races, with remote control, pit stops and everything, while our fathers had to content themselves with tiny toy cars. Less toys, but more space for inventing ! And of course, you can consider the ""toy"" TV as a modem version of the ""toy"" book; no more need to wonder what the characters look like !
All this is contrasted to "" the good old times"", when toys were much simpler. By consequence, children could invent a whole special world around their toys, each time something different. You had to make it real by yourself ! And this is something I would plead for: let the children free, let them improvise and don't impose one narrow vision or reality on them !
These ""technological"" games are always promoted by hugh publicity campaigns, which make people believe everything the slogans say: such games would be the ultimate thing to have. Of course, the companies fabricating them make enormeous profits out of it, thanks to the short-sighted people who swallow such illusions. And when the majority of your son's classmates has got a kind of computer game, he'll be soon be begging for one too.
But there are still antibodies against this spreading virus : first, the youth movement . They have to work with limited means, so they try to stimulate children's creative side by making them inventing games, by having them knock together their own toys, and so on.
So called cultural activities can be quite helpfull too : children should be encouraged to read a lot (and not only comic strips !) - it doesn't have to be expensive, everybody can go to a library. If they want to, take them to concerts, exhibitions, theatre (on their level, of course), ... or give them the opportunity to participate in such activities themselves.
My conclusion : despite the negative influence of industialisation and technology, parents can have a very positive effect on their children's imagination, It's only a matter of creating a certain atmosphere where creativity is encouraged and where time can be made available for it. If the parents try to cultivate it, children are likely to follow their example.
I'm not at all forbidding children to have toys to play with, on the contrary ! Children should be enabled to be children, and not little adults. But they should be made aware that families without a TV also manage to survive, and that there are other interesting things beside their Nintendos.

DBAN3054,2.0,,,,,,The prison system is outdated. No civilized society should punish its criminals: it should rehabilitate them,"
I sometimes wonder if our society is really as civilised as we always presume. During the last two centuries, science, technology, medicine and psychology have made great progresses. But in all these branches of rational and irrational investigations, a great part still remains undiscovered. For example in psychology, we try to understand and to clarify man's behaviour and his motives. But we can never foretell with an absolute certainty how someone is going to react. The human being is very complex. In fact we know very little about the working of the brain and the emotions. Our society may look more civilised now than a thousand years ago when people killed each other with axes and not with guns or bombs. But do we, the people, have become more civilised? I mean: has the inside of man changed?
The idea to change evil persons into good persons is very attractive, but the question is how we are going to do this without violating man's mind. To rehabilitate a criminal, we have to influence his view of life and his opinions, not only his external behaviour. This means we have to penetrate into the deepest self of that person. If this is possible at all ... There has been written a lot about societies who try to control the minds or the behaviour of the people. In ""Brave new world"" people are conditioned from before their birth to like their social situation so that no one has a reason to feel misjudged or to protest. The government succeeds in its goal (social stability) but has to pay the price: the people are like robots who are not free to think for themselves or to have strong individual emotions. ""A clockwork orange"" deals with the fight against violence. The criminal undergoes a therapy which links violent scenes to feelings of sickness. The doctors and promotors of this new method want to change the criminal's behaviour not by changing his opinions but by creating an artificial physical abhorrence of violence. Methods like brainwashing people or conditioning them may proove effective, but can we also justify them? The emprisonment of a criminal isn't only a punishment for that particular person but also a protection for society. It must be clear that in this case I am speaking of hard criminals like maffia bosses, drug dealers or murderers. Too many criminals who are put in jail shouldn't be there: street criminals, hooligans and vandalists, drug addicts ... Prison is a concentration of evil and people go out as more wicked persons than they were before. It is difficult for them to reintegrate in society with their criminal record and their bad reputation. They cannot find a job, have lost their friends ... Then the move to their earlier criminal world isn't great. In such cases, alternative punichments would be better both for the criminal and for society. Hooligans should rebuild what they have destroyed to realise the impact of their act. Criminals from lower social classes often have the feeling to be good for nothing. They could work on a project to do something good for their companions and get responsibility and confidence. This may sound idealistic but I think it is worth trying it. The real problem of criminality goes farther than the problem of the rehabilitation or the emprisonment of criminals. A civilised society in the true sense of the word should look to the cause of the problem and not to the consequences. The structure of society is often the one that should be changed.

DBAN3055,2.5,,,,,,"Some people say that in our modern world, dominated by science and technology and industrialisation, there is no longer a place for dreaming and imagination. What is your opinion?","
Traditionally people differentiate alpha from beta sciences. Alpha sciences are also called positive sciences ( mathematics, physics, chemistry ... ), while beta sciences deal about the human brain and man's activities.
There used to be a time when science was a passionate occupation, based solely on the curiosity of the individual himself. The hunger for true knowledge inspired the ""spirit of the labs"". When it appeared that these ""fruits of amazement"" resulted in practical tools, it was twice a victory.
Nowadays research is submitted to the growing demands of society. Science must have a useful dimension. Modern man is spoilt. We try to create our own needs and science must bring revelation. Utility prevails upon originality. Therefore science has become an economic product. Its results must have a certain value at the market. Researchers are degrading themselves. They seem to have reached the infamous level of publicity agents, desperately trying to sell their ideas to large institutions like the State or multi-nationals. So, rich nations and organisations are the only ones to hold the key of true knowledge. By using it they control man's thoughts and man's future.
The moral decay of science is thus in fact a luxury problem. More and faster are the keywords of modern times. There are, however, limits to speed and capacity. That's why mankind invented machines. These machines stood in service of humanity. Nowadays, man often stands in service of the machine, slowly becoming a machine himself.
To ultimate aim of science is to reach infinity. That is what I call scientific arrogance, because every living process is born to decease one day. When we strive for everlasting life we are, in fact, feeding this process of dehumanilization. Man is born to die. The fear of death is one of the most important aspects in a human life. When science deprives us of our right to die, we cease to be human beings.
When does Huxley's science fiction novel "" Brave New World"" stops to be fiction ? If I hear about the frightening progress that is being made in genetics, I fear not too long.
In the very near future scientists will be able to compose a human being, solely with genetic material. The proud ""parents"" can choose the I.Q., length, colour of the eyes ... of their newborn ""lab-child"". Even the gothic novelist Mary Shelley could not foresee that a modern version of Frankenstein is now ready to rule the world.
Another bloodcurdling evolution is the development of Virtual Reality. Soon we will be able to do practically everything in a world designed by computers. Contact with real human beings will be limited as much as possible. This can't be healthy for the human spirit. V.R. will alter us all into hermits.
Can we do something to stop scientific arrogance ? I must admit that it is very hard to fight against the natural law of progression. I hope, however, that some people share my point of vieuw on this matter. We must try to provoke a social debate about esthetics, which is the paramount beta science, in order to break the supremacy of the devastating alpha sciences. This debate is very important: humanity is at stake !
I am not an enemy of alpha sciences. We need chemistry, for instance, to provide medication. I do object to the search for infinity. Let us all dream about paradise instead of looking for it. A perfect world with perfect people must be a very boring place. And besides, true knowledge is not to be found on your computer-screen; it is to be found in the heart.

DBAN3056,3.0,4.0,,,,,All armies should consist entirely of professional soldiers: there is no value in a system of military service,"
When the Minister of Defence Leo Delcroix did away with the military service in Belgium, a lot of youngsters greeted this news with cheerful minds. At least now they wouldn't be deprived of one precious year of their lives. From now on every young man who was not interested in a militaristic interlude in his life could just simply go on leading a life he himself had chosen to live. So looking through the eyes of those fierceful, vital young men this abolishment was - to use an understatement - not such a bad thing for them. But what about the idea in general: abolishing military service and using only professional soldiers?
Financially speaking the government gets rid of a heavy burden. The weight of the military costs will be strikingly decreased. Noone will have a problem with this but when we get to the moral aspect, it gets a bit more complicated. THE question is after all: what is the use of an army? Of course you can say that if everyone did away with their armies, there would be no more wars, no more surpression, no more oppression, no more whatever. And I must admit that this new-age talk sounds very nice in theory ... but unfortunately in practice ... it is not like that at all. There will always be wars and warpigs who want to have all the power. So then the question is how to stop such people and their armies. Or put in other words: what IS the value, the use of armies in the so-called 'free' countries.
Maybe one of the most important potential uses of an army is to provide soldiers for the United Nations Peace Corps. This corps is perhaps the only morally acceptable army in the world. But it can only be useful if this corps is given more power. There is no point in sending UN-soldiers to observe the civil war in Ruanda when they are not able to defend themselves and are being shot at. Being a target was about the only thing they were allowed to do.
The professional soldiers of an army should also be better trained, better skilled and better paid than they are now. Because of the fact that the conscripted soldiers are abolished and only a few professional soldiers are left, those few should be at least as efficient as the entire army (conscripted and professional soldiers) was before. Each country that is a UNmember should in fact train their soldiers to be experts in a field and then form elite troops per field.
By writing all this you may get a wrong impression of me. I am not an advocate of armies. If I could make them all disappear and give world peace I would make them all disappear and give world peace ... but I can't and noone else can. And that is the reason why I believe in an alternative army (The elaborated UN-peace corps) with the most experted and skilled men to intervene in, controll and restore those things a war can do wrong to civilization.

DBAN3057,2.5,2.5,,,,,"Some people say that in our modern world, dominated by science and technology and industrialisation, there is no longer a place for dreaming and imagination. What is your opinion?","
A period in history in which there certainly was a place for dreaming and imagination was the period of romanticism. The romantic movement was a reaction against classicism which was dominated by rationality. In the 18th and 19th century a huge turn takes place in the artistic world. The romantic poet and painter were both attracted by the irrational forces of life. In their creations they refer mainly to emotions and imagination instead of to the outer world as perceived by the senses.
The new ideas of romanticism accompanied some important changes in society. At that time a lot of countries evolved from agricultural to modern industrial nations. Because of the negative consequences of the Industrial Revolution a lot of artists rejected society. They expressed ther dissatisfaction, their desire to escape to exotic places and heroic pasts and their interest in religion, dreams, etc. The romantic artists were also inspired by the great revolutions of their time and developed strong patriotic feelings.
The question is whether such an imaginative climate is still possible in the 20th century. I think that our modern world shows quite some similarities with the romantic period. It has it's own problems like environmental pollution, widespread poverty, nationalism that cause great dissatisfaction among people. They also fear that some scientifical discoveries will do more harm than good to human society. They don't believe in unlimited progress anymore.
There are several possible actions to these problems. Some people commit themselves actively and try to do something about them while others couldn't care less. Then there are also those people who see the problems but feel too small to do something about them. Because they feel powerless they escape in their dreams and imagination.
This is positive if the imagination leads to creativity f.i. writing or painting. But I think it can also lead to a negative way of living. People can get so absorbed by their imaginative world that they become completely passive or worse, addicted to things that make it easier to escape from 'the real world' like television, drugs or alcohol.
So rather than saying that modern society leaves room for imagination, I'd say that it creates an imaginative climate and imaginative persons. The complexity of our world (makes a lot of peo) and the negative consequences of industrialisation and science technology make a lot of people so dissatisfied that they create their own dreamworld.
I have nothing against dreaming and using your imagination as long as it stays a healthy imagination that leads to a creative mind and that still allows you to keep a grip on reality.

DBAN3059,3.5,3.5,,,,,Crime does not pay,"
Knowledge. An item that everyone should put on top of his or her Christmas list. Don't we all want to know what everything is all about, have a better insight on complex matters? Some things we take for granted, we call them general knowledge, things like: 'Crime does not pay'. But isn't it also true that the best way to examen the veracity and value of such a statement, is to question it?
Let's have a closer look at Crime. We are very sharp in calling everything that is illegal a crime and therefore bad. But crime can also be an art-form, a medium to express an idea or a conviction. Why not look at a few examples?
Soft drugs are illegal, it is a criminal offence to use them. In the 1960's in Belgium, they would throw you in prison for carrying just a few grams. It was considered a disease of society. Using soft drugs in my country, and in many others, is still not allowed. Then why is it still used and certainly not only by so called 'lower class' people? People have been using drugs as long as there have been people. If we look at history, we see that great artist and writers took drugs to expand their capacities. Drugs are not necessarily evil. They shouldn't be called a crime without distinction.
Abortion, also very illegal in Belgium until a few years back. Finally, the government realized that there truly are cases in which abortion is the only solution, e.g. when the future of the child is non-existing. Aren't we supposed to ask ourselves if our definition of crime might just be incorrect? It was a crime to take away a potential human being from the mother's womb after, for instance, a rape, now it is no longer. Therefore tell me, is there a difference in time? Or: was it in the early days less terrible for a woman to get raped?
Those are only two taken from a long list of Crimes. When public opinion changes in a positive sense, it usually means that it becomes more open-minded. Thus, people have to be informed about the other sides of life. To form an opinion on subjects like drugs, abortion.... it is best to know something more about them, possibly to have experience in what ever way.
We must stop using crime as a word with extreme negative connotation. Sometimes it can be very educating to get to know other ideas from people who think and are different than the average man in the street. A little less prejudice can make this world much more comfortable to live in and it can make it easier for people to understand one and other.

Some people often say that in our modern world, with its science-culture, technology and industrialisation there is no longer a place for dreaming and imagination. Will, I think they're wrong. I think there IS room for creativity, and that room is to be found in every human being. Besides, also science needs imagination. Think of Albert Einstein's . Without new and fresh thoughts, science would be nowhere. Only it's up to ourselves to use our capacities and to have faith in ourselves. But now, this using our mental capacities and being self-assured seems to be the problem.
Indeed, in our (Western) modern world we all suffer an overwhelming pressure of technology, and television seems to have replaced our imagination. Science has evolved that far that only an elitest group of people can keep up. Now this works somehow frustrating, because people begin to think they're somewhat backward, as they can never really understand what's going on. This feeling of frustration results in a tendency of denying everything that cannot scientifically be proved or that seems to be irrational and absurd. People sometimes feel unsafe or uneasy when confronted with their imagination, or else they reject it because they don't see the sense of it in a scientific world as ours.
This uneasiness can even go further and lead to fear for the irrational, and science and technology then become 'safety bases' where no nightmare can gain access to.
The paradox is thus that people will take to science to create some solid base of what is possible and what's not, but at the same time science is also a source of frustration, uneasiness and fear.
This problematic attitude towards creativity and imagination could also (partly) be explained by the fact that very many people lack self-assurance, which is caused by this pressure of science and technology. People are afraid to come out with something, fear science's conviction and reactions. Those that have the guts are pigeonholed as 'idiotic idealists'.
In spite of all these difficulties, I think there must be a place for imagination in this world. Without our creativity and dreams oar world will fall apart. Not only science, but every bit of our life needs imagination. Life would certainly be unbearable otherwise. People have a need to dream (this is even scientifically proved!). At the same time, our imagination can be very useful for the whole of civilisation. We have the possibilities to make the world a better place! A lot of wars, social problems, our environment and what have you need our creativity in order to be solved. Who's stopping us to start dreaming?

DBAN3065,3.0,,,,,,Most university degrees are theoretical and do not prepare students for the real world. They are therefore of very little value,"
Some people believe that university education is theoretical and therefore does not prepare students for the real world. In their view, the only knowledge universities give you is bookish knowledge, which you can hardly use in your future post. Hardly any attention is paid to the practical side of the education.
To a certain extent I agree with this-conviction. How many times do you find a company offering a job in an ad that doesn't ask for someone 'with experience's Not very often, I'm afraid. The reason why companies strongly insist on experienced people is probably that they have had bad experiences with newly graduated employees. I can easily imagine that companies prefer people with a lot of practical knowledge in their pockets. But where ever are students supposed to get those practical skills? In my opinion, university education is remiss in this respect.
To make these statements more concrete and to the point, I'll confine myself to philological trainings, like Germanic languages. Graduate teachers are not prepared for the hard world of education. They don't know how to quiet down a shouting and unruly class or which teaching method to use in order to get the best results. In short, they are not able to cope with certain practical problems. For no one has ever familiarized them with the practical side of the teaching job.
Too many people think that a teacher's task is to walk into the classroom, give his lesson and leave the classroom again. But there is so much more to it than meets the eye! If there is no order in the classroom, it's really not easy to teach. In view of such a situation, I think that a course in pedagogics would be of use to any teacher-to-be, for teaching also involves 'upbringing'. A teacher helps a young person to grow into a balanced and independent adult.
But not only students of philology who want a future in education need practical skills. Those who go for journalism or economics could use these skills as well. Most graduates of philology have never studied any economics in their whole lives, whereas they really should have a notion of it if they want to work in a company.
Seeing that students of philology go different ways after their education, I suggest the following adjustments of the university educational system. During the last year of any philological training, optional courses should be provided in education, journalism, economics, ... . Each student should decide for himself what his future plans are and select a course in accordance with those plans. Pedagogics, business economics, social skills, statistics and technical jargon should be some of the optional courses. In my view, it's extremely important that those courses should focus on practice. They should enable students to put their bookish theory into practice and to specialize in those things they will really need in their future jobs.
That way, university degrees will stand for high theoretical nd practical knowledge.
Apparently universities are willing to do something about it. They want to introduce an extra teacher training year after philological trainings. But unfortunately the Minister of Education Luc Van den Bossche doesn't agree to this proposal. He is prepared to contribute his mite though, by offering the universities extra subsidy. It's a step in the right direction, but there is more to be done.
Comparing a university education with a secondary teacher training, lower level, you'll see a world of difference. Yet, students from university as well as from teachers' training college end up in the same boat when they choose for education! The difference: secondary teachers lower level are competent at writing on the blackboard, oral expression, preparing a lesson, ... . Moreover, they know everything about the educational system, which can't be said about university students.
In fine, universities could learn a lot from teachers' training colleges as far as the practical aspect is concerned. I think it would be a good thing to bring about a mixture of both types. As a consequence, some university studies might last a year longer, but that's the price we'll have to pay for a university degree with real value!

DBAN3068,3.0,3.0,,,,,The prison system is outdated. No civilized society should punish its criminals: it should rehabilitate them,"

These are just a few headlines figuring recently in a newspaper. No need to argue that criminality has come to a dangerous height nowedays. There are indeed big problems concerning the prison system. Prisons are complaining about the poor, inhuman living conditions, due to lack of space and money.
However, must we therefore say that the system is outdated ? Wouldn't it be better if we looked at the offenders themselves ? How on earth is it possible that there are so many people committing crimes ? Why do more and more kids become delinquents and have less scruples about it ?
In the 19th century people were sentenced too fast and for stupid, silly reasons like homosexuality, demonstrations for female rights and having another opinion than the rulers'. Now that this narrow-mindedness has gone, we have moved in the ""far-too-tolerant"" direction. Convicts are released earlier for their good conduct in prison, but do we grant them something in that way ? Shouldn't we feel guilty if afterwards these people do the same things again ? Is it in this way that society wants to rehabilitate its criminals ?
Bandits and muggers have placed themselves out of society by threatening it, by robbing innocent people. They made an infringement on human privacy and laid their hands on things that didn't belong to them. They've caused an atmosphere in which you can't be save anymore, even in your own house. Women can't go out in the streets anylonger, afraid of being attacked and raped.
If we want to change this, we should change the prison system and moreover the punishment system. Far too often convictions are not harsh enough, they don't scare the criminals. Some might even think : ""Five years in prison, that are five without worries"". Prisonors have to be made aware of the crime they committed. That's why I plead for the reintroduction of capital punishment (death penalty) for murderers and its consistent application. Criminals should not be treated as victims of society. A bad youth and unemployement are no excuses for a murder or any other immoral deed.
in my opinion a murder is unforgiveable in every way, there are no extenuating circumstances. It simply doesn't ask for remorse . Declaring the criminal not imputable is an easy way to deal with him.
However, we look too often at the criminals nowedays. We follow them with our cameras, we read their stories in the papers, we watch the proceeding of their trial on television. So we forget the victims sometimes. Their lives-if they still have one-are not the same anymore. They may be injured, both psychologically and physically, for ever. These people and their families won't be verry happy with the early release of the criminal.
Only by punishments that scare criminals, violence can be reduced. Now it's up to the politicians , who promised a lot last month. Let's see if they do something about it .

DBAN3070,3.5,,,,,,The prison system is outdated. No civilized society should punish its criminals: it should rehabilitate them,"
Nowadays, more and more people state that criminals shouldn't be punished by imprisonment: they should be re-educated and social workers should adjust them to society.
This growing concern with prisoners seems to be a side effect of our service society: everybody regularly sees his dentist, his GP, psychologist and fitness teacher. We write letters for human rights organisations and we are all against animal experiments. In this same context we find our prison system barbaric and outdated: crime is a disease that should be cured. If we may believe the sollicitors, most criminals are in a state of diminished responsibility because of a few traumatic experiences in their youths.
In an article that originates with the Flemish community, W. Demeester and M. Wathelet are pleading for a fast rehabilitation of detained criminals, but I believe that politicians' objections to imprisonment are rather economic than moral. Our prisons are overcrowded and the system costs heaps of money.
Whatever one's objections may be, our present prison system is indeed far from ideal. Many acts of violence are only punished with a suspended sentence or a fine. Businessmen get away with swindling the state because of procedural faults and sentences up to fifteen years are almost automatically reduced to five years or even less.
Our whole legal system has to be reworked, but certainly not softened: that would be a dangerous thing to do in a society where many dissatisfied people vote for extremist parties out of a feeling of insecurity. I think that last October's elections prove that people want more severe and more consequent punishments for criminals, so a mass rehabilitation of criminals would only add fuel to the flames. People should be given enough time to get used to a new system.
Maybe it would be a good start to try and keep as many convicts as possible out of prison. Too often prisons are used to stash away people we don't want to be confronted with in our society. Vagrants, drug addicts and illegal refugees don't belong in jail. They should be kept by qualified authorities. Young delinquents who behave violently because they are fed up with school or because they feel neglected at home, will probably benefit more from a re-education or readaptation program than from a night in jail, where they may even come in contact with major criminals.
I've also read about experiments with so-called alternative punishments: vandals who had cut open the coverings of seats in buses or had damaged tombstones simply because they got a kick out of it, had to join a cleaning team or had to make themselbes useful on a graveyard for a few weeks. I think that such a treatment is more likely to teach them respect for someone else's work than a fine or a reprimand would do. Of course, such alternatives are only possible with minor crimes.
Major criminals should be kept away from society as long as possible: they have shown a disrespect for humanity. For them I can't think of a good alternative for imprisonment, though I'm not so sure that a long story in prison will change them to moral citizens. Anyway, I can't say that our government isn't trying to make the best of it. Recently, the ministry of Justice and the Flemish community have come to an agreement concerning the social rehabilitation of prisoners: a permanent welfare team will be established in every prison, made up of one or more internal social workers and one or more social workers of a registrated welfare centre of the Flemish community. These social workers will take care of a continuous support of the prisoners and their families. They will try to solve existing problems and try to prepare them for a new life in society, with the help of hundreds of volunteers who regurlary visit prisoners, in order to keep them in touch with society.
A prison system that merely locks people up is certainly outdated, but in reality this is still often the case. But with more money available, prisons could become useful institutions. I think there's certainly hope for the future.

DBAN3071,2.0,2.0,,,,,Feminists have done more harm to the cause of women than good,"
Feminism, the ideological movement that strives for total equality between men and women on every domain of the public life, has been a topic for discussion ever since its existence. It's sheer fact that a certain type of male feels uneasy at the thought of women having the sane amount of power as they have. These men dislike the idea of equality between the two sexes and bore the rest of the world by saying that a woman's ""real place"" is at home. A little bit more surprising than the existence of this male sexism is the fact that there are also women who are not very keen on feminists. Especially nowadays, a lot of former feminists have turned against the feminist movement because they are disappointed by its achievements. In order to understand this disappointment we have to ]mow that feminism has always stimulated women to become more finencially independant. Financial independance implies earning a living and therefore more and more women abandoned their housewife existence and got a job. But this only made their life twice as hard : next to their day's work, they also had to fulfill all of the household tasks. Unfortunately, this situation hasn't changed for most working women. This is due to the fact that the role division between husband and wife has remained more or less the same throughout the years. Women are still expected to cook, wash, clean and look after husband and children. Men in their turn are supposed to maintain the garden and polish off technical jobs. From childhood onwards we are taught by television, books, movies and advertisements that this is the normal way for Men and women to lie together. But actually, these sex roles lead to very unhealthy relationships. Now, to say that feminists have done more harm to the cause of women than good, would be utterly wrong in my opinion. Feminism has changed the position of women in our society for the better. For one thing they have gained more social, cultural and economic power. They have also been made aware that they don't necessarily need to depend on men for physical safety, financial security, mechanical skills and abstract thinking. It's however the whole of society that keeps clinging to the typical sex roles. This makes sexual equality impossible.
It's now up to every individual couple to divide the household tasks in such a way that both partners have an equal amount of work to do. The government, the education system and especially the media can contribute to this by making people aware of the present disharmonious situation and by imposing a new sort of 'ideal family'-model in which men also occupy themselves with tasks that were traditionally reserved for women. So there's still a lot of work to be done, but if sufficient efforts are made, the future might belong to men and women.

DBAN3073,4.0,,,,,,"Some people say that in our modern world, dominated by science and technology and industrialisation, there is no longer a place for dreaming and imagination. What is your opinion?","
In our age we are used to it that everything is done for us, instead of by us. For everything we have some kind of machine, or we have someone else do it for us. It seems people have lost their imagination, their ingenuity. Is this really so ?
Art, for instance, is a skill for which imagination is a central necessity. There are still lots of people going to art schools or performing some art or another. A lot of resourcefulness is definately required, because after 2000 years of civilisation it is very hard to be original, to become a bright star in the over-crowded sky. It's not only harder now than in former days , but also different, because the medium of art has changed ; not yet a century ago, people used to sit down and consume lots of poetry and prose, and now books are more or less replaced by television and movies, and in the near future we'll have interactive television and visual reality. A change of medium also requires a change in thinking. To make television programs, or to direct a movie involves a complete new kind of ingenuity. Because of new technologies, people are forced to invent new forms of art, they have to adapt. industrialisation gives new forms of imagination.
Industrialisation and resourcefulness also go together the other way around : without the dreams of some strange inventors, very handy discoveries would probably not have been made... Nowadays we can travel easily from one continent to another, but this wouldn't have been true if two brothers hadn't dreamed about flying like a bird in the sky. We wouldn't even have known America if in the 15th century someone didn't have a crazy idea to sail in another direction than usually! It is true that nowadays it seems that for every question there is a computer to answer it, and for every default a machine to fix it, but there are still far more unsolvable problems than ways to solve them. People will always search and search, and sometimes great discoveries will be made by pure scientific means only, but, there will always be dreaming inventors that from time to time find something very useful also.
We hear people complain that today's children don't know what imagination is anymore, because everything is ready-made. "" In former days children only got a box of building blocks, and they were able to make whole cities out of it, but then came Lego, which made it easier, and now you can buy complete prebuilt toy houses and cars"", older people say. Is this true ? Yes, it is. Does it mean that children's imagination is not stimulated anymore ? No, it doesn't. Children simply use their ingenuity in other fields. Instead of thinking about how to build a house, they will invent stories of people living in the houses. Give a six-year-old a game to play on the computer, and he will find out how to play it faster than any adult. Children's creativity and skill are not gone, they have simply shifted to another field.
Today's world is ruled by technology, science and industry. Sometimes it seems these let no room for dreams and imagination, but if you look closer, these important parts of human life are still there, only in another form than before the age of television and computers.

FIAB1005,3.5,3.0,,,,,Feminists have done more harm to the cause of women than good,"
The feminist movement, the one we know today, began sometime in the 1960s, with women demanding their rights to jobs, political power, abortion and over all, the right to decide for themselves. They wanted to take women ""out of the kitchens and nurseries"", to the fields of life where they could make an impact. The feminists were regarded with suspicion by the general public, and disliked for their pushy way of doing things (demonstrations etc.) They were ""not feminine"", but still made themselves known as the feminists.
The feminists began a wave of sexual liberation and gave women a different status in society. What good there came out of it was that women lended their skills, talents, and intelligence to a world that much needed it, and the picture of women being stupid and uncapable of thinking was removed quite successfully. But on the way, lots of things were done wrongly. The view of the feminists as being slightly masculine, wearing trousers and heavy boots, changed radically in the eighties. Madonna and Cher came along as representatives for the ""new"" feminism - mini skirts and net stockings were the new power tools for these daring and outspoken women that no one stepped on who would not ruefully regret it later. The new prototype was that of an independent woman with her own career, with (or preferable without) children, with lots of affairs, (AIDS changed the trend in the mid-eighties) with lots of money and with lots of ""go"" in her. And of course she had to be stunningly beautiful and sexy, using all her wiles to get what she wanted, balancing successfully upon her black stiletto heels. This is largely the picture that has remained until this day.
I really believe feminism has done more wrong than good to the women in our society. Equality is a good thing, as far as one can take it without intruding on the identity of the men. Women have had, and still have, a tremendous workload that can seem really unfair at times, and the men clearly need to realise that their help is needed in household chores, in raising the children etc. What I feel has gone wrong is that the ""new territory"" we have gained has left some of us worse off than before. Lots of unhappy children have left in the wake of working parents, lots of men have left their homes when they felt no longer needed, and many women have suffered stress and burn-outs without understanding why. Another thing I think is wrong is that the feminists have wanted to make feminists out of every woman. Those who chose not to work, chose to be home with the children, were regarded with contempt. Housewives are ""suppressed"", ""slaves to the men"", ""have no will of their own"". Though one of the aims of feminism seems to be ""liberation of the true self"" everyone had to be liberated the same way, otherwise it was not acceptable.
Feminism has gone too far. The extremists use abortion as a contraceptive as acceptable as the Pill, and concepts of what is right and wrong is blurred by the vision of self-realisation at any cost. The new feminists are in many cases traitors of ""true"" feminism. The way to gain respect and equality is seldom to step on someone else, in this case the men and anyone else opposing the cause. That is, in my opinion, feminism today, and I am not exactly proud of it.

FIAB1007,3.5,,,,,,"In the words of the old song: ""Money is the root of all evil""","
. This is how a song by Abba starts. It was popular in the 70's and it is still somewhat played, but it could as well have been written in the 90's. For many rich people - and especially for them - money means everything.
It is really amazing how greedy rich people can become. Regarding how much money they already have, they have no qualified reason to want more. They have more money than they ever can spend. I quote Quintus Horatius Flaccus, because I think this quote fits perfectly in this connection: . At the same time homeless people try to find a shelter for the night and some leftover food from the garbage, so that they wouldn't starve to death. The contrast is so big that you can't even fully understand it. The life of the rich people is something that the poor and homeless only can dream of. However, the rich don't even know how many homeless there are and if they know, they don't care. They are only interested in themselves and their money and property. These are of course heavy generalisations, but unfortunately the truth about many wealthy people. Then there is this other group of rich people. In order to have a good image, they pretend that they really care. They donate great amounts of money to charity and suddenly they are great heroes. Of course their money is very welcome, but in fact they are nothing else but hypocrites. Frankly, I don't know which is worse. Not to care at all or to be a hypocrite.
Of course it's natural that we need money in order to survive. Everything costs, nothing is free. But despite that money doesn't have to be the most important factor in one's life. I think the happiest people are those who have enough money, so they can live a normal life. In my opinion that's the way it also should be. And even if we self think that we have a little money, we always have more than the starving people in Bosnia or Africa. A couple marks from our wallet don't matter, but a couple marks for a starving child can mean everything.
Finland has just gone through a heavy recession and we've slowly started to recover from it. You have to cut a little here and there and raise taxes and other payments. I don't think that the politicians really understand what it means to wonder how to pay the rent and get the money to the food and necessary clothes. Their salary is secured, so they don't have to worry about such things. For them money is self-evident. There are nearly half a million unemployed people in Finland at the moment. They have to manage somehow on the dole, which is nothing to cheer at. Last summer I worked at a bank. There you have to deal with big sums of money - other people's money, so your attitude towards the value of money changes. You kind of begin to respect the money in a different way than before.
Even though money can be a powerful weapon, there are things which can't be bought and which shouldn't be bought. You can't measure love, health, family or friends in money. They are all above the value of money.

FIAB1009,3.0,3.0,,,,,"In the words of the old song: ""Money is the root of all evil""","
Money is said to be the root of all evil. I agree, and I would like to add religion to that statement as well, but I will not. Money has become the centre of life to most people, perhaps it has always been that way. We have a tendency to make a distinction of rank, on the basis of how much money a person has. If a person is poor, he is considered to be a failure and lazy, but if he is rich, we admire that person because he has succeeded in life.
Happiness is measured in money. Not at all, says the rich man, but who would listen to him. He has never had to cope without it. Instead of trying to think about what would really give us satisfaction in life, most people have their aim set at making as much money as they can.
Let us have a look at what problems money has caused. First of all we have the developing countries that have been caught in a vicious cirkle. Many of the developing countries have been exploited by colonial powers. Instead of using the little arable land they have for growing food for their own people, they are growing coffeeplants, or the land is needed for cattle, those products are sold to industrial countries who are able to pay a very low price. For that little money the developing countries have to buy expensive food from the industrial countries, since they can not grow it themselves. Unless a developing country has a great natural resource, like oil or precious metals, it will be very difficult for it to get out of the cirkle.
If a developing country would, for instance find oil, it would not take long before it was dragged into war by its neighbour countries, and then of course the U.S.A would have to interfere, after all, we are talking about the black gold. People in developing countries are not able to get a good education, that would help them get away from the poverty.
The easiest and fastest way to make money is by becoming a criminal. Start dealing drugs, so what if it ruins peoples lives or kills them you will be rich. In order for the drugaddicts to get their money for drugs, they have to start committing crimes, and the cirkle is once again closing.
Does anybody know how much of our environment we have destroyed for a small profit? The development of car and heating fuels that are more harmless to the environment is slowed down by the big oilcompanies. Trees are made into paper, because we do not want to pay a bit more for recycled paper. How many people have been blackmailed, kidnapped or murdered this week, nobody knows. How many streetkids in Southamerica have been killed for their organs or had their eyes removed. These organs are sold on the blackmarket to the U.S.A. Makes one sick, does it not.
The russian mafia is crawling into Finland, are we able to stop it.
It is clear that money is the root of all evil, but there is nothing we can do about it. I have decided to become a teacher, because I enjoy working with people, and after the time as a poor student, ever a teacher's pay will be like a fortune.

FIAB1011,4.0,3.0,,,,,The prison system is outdated. No civilized society should punish its criminals: it should rehabilitate them,"
Punishments are neither constructive nor educating, but degrading and humiliating. A person who is punished for something he/she has done wrong often becomes bitter and aggressive. To avoid that the feelings result in aggressive actions, the reason why and what in the persons actions it was that was wrong should be made clear to the criminal and he/she should also be given a chance to change attitude and behaviour through rehabilitation.
However, the prison system, as it is today, is based on the concept that crime requires punishment and that dangerous persons like psychopaths and murderers should not be allowed to walk around uncontrolled among other people in the streets. The prisons do keep some of the worst criminals off the streets and isolate them from the outside world. The life in prison is much more monotonous and poor than the life outside and by forcing the criminals to follow the strict, dull everyday patterns and rules the prisons deprive them of their independence and thereby fulfill their role as controlling and punishing institutions.
At the same time, the prison might even be considered a sort of holiday resort for some prisoners. There are libraries, television rooms, gyms and other places where the prisoners have opportunities for convivial gatherings in the prisons. The degree of freedom inside the prison naturally is connected to the degree of gravity of the crime committed and what kind of prison it is. For a person who comes from a very difficult background and has to struggle all the time to be able to provide for him/herself or a family, the isolation and carelessness of the prison may perhaps feel like a vacation, for a shorter time at least.
Nothing else than a relatively good behaviour is required from a criminal in prison. There are possibilities to self-education and development, but it is not obligatory and a prisoner can easily just sit off the time without being obliged to do anything, except cleaning the cell, perhaps. When the imprisonment time is served, the person is released and returns to the situation he/she came from, which may not have changed very much. Inevitably, the person will be tempted to commit new crimes and unless he/she has decided not to, has a very strong self-discipline and strong support from family and friends, he/she will give in to the temptation and again become a criminal and also go back to prison.
The bad circle which many criminals get stuck in, could maybe be avoided or stopped, if the prisons would start to rehabilitate the prisoners. They ought to have rehabilitation programmes which would be very tough and require total commitment from the criminals. The programmes would include disciplinary physical and mental training, basic and advancing education in reading, writing, mathematics and social subjects. The programme would be offered to the criminals in the beginning of their imprisonment as an alternative to the normal prison. Naturally there would be such criminals who would not want to nor see any reason to change behaviour, and on those the programme would be wasted. But for those of the criminals who would try their best and go through the hard programme, it would be a great profit. After their release, they could come back on a regular basis for check-ups and at the same time get advice and support from people who know their situations, because they are in a similar situation themselves.
If the prisons would start to rehabilitate the criminals instead of punishing them, both the society and the criminals themselves would profit, and the role of the prisons as the institutions who realize justice in our society would be greatly improved.

FIAB1053,3.5,3.0,,,,,Crime does not pay,"
Contrary to what most people believe, crime pays. You may raise your eyebrows, but this is fact and no nonsense if we are to believe a report I saw on TV a couple of weeks ago. The programme presented portraits of two Swedish people, ordinary citizens just like you and me. However, some would consider them to be criminals. This is their story - read and judge.
Maria is 28 years old. Due to backache, for three years she is unable to work. She is entitled to an early retirement pension, which is big enough for her to get along every month. Yet, the sum provided to her by the state, the taxpayers that is, covers only the necessities of life. However, Maria, who enjoys life despite her handicap, has found a way to make her money last. Five days a week she takes care of five small children of her friends. In her former life, the life that she had before the backache began to terrorize her, she was a hairdresser. Every now and then she cuts and shapes the hairs of her neighbours and relatives, and gets paid accordingly. This 'black' work means a pretty sum of 25,000 Swedish crowns extra every month. No income tax is paid. By law, she is allowed to earn a certain sum of money beyond her pension, but not by far this large a sum. Is this then legal?
Maria lives together with her boy-friend Jan, who is 32 years old. As a teenager he was involved in a car accident and lost one of his legs. He is now totally dependent on his wheelchair, and since he does not have an education it is difficult for Jan to get employed. Every month he receives unemployment benefit and disablement pension. As it happens, he has always been interested in cars and finds great pleasure in fixing cars of friends and relatives. He is very skilful and has his hands full. He is a positive and friendly man, and his customers gladly pay him for his work. He usually earns 15,000-20,000 crowns each month. Of course it is so called 'black' money, but as long as no one finds out, what harm could it make? The extra money the couple makes, they spend on travels, good food and clothes. They think that the extravagances they allow themselves make up for the tragedies in their lives, and do not consider their behaviour to be wrong. Even if they are aware of the fact that they are breaking the law.
Clearly, this is malversation of state money, a crime which would normally imply some sort of punishment. However, since the authorities are not conscious of the situation, the couple lives a happy and rich life. And nobody is going to give the couple away. The reason for my thinking so, is that we do not consider this as bad a crime as we would consider a murder or a robbery. Besides, given the chance any of us would probably like to earn some extra tax-free money, wouldnt we? In the TV-programme, the Swedish Chancellor of the Exchequer was interviewed, and he had to admit that if a neighbour needed his help in any matter, and would be willing to pay for the services, he would accept the money without a doubt. It seems as if we are more likely to accept a crime if the crime is of such a character that we could easily do it ourselves.
This kind of malversation is perhaps rather a crime against the unwritten rules and norms that exist in society. But it is no less a crime. My normal standpoint is that crime does not pay, but in this case I am willing to change my mind. If the couple gets away with it, the assertion that crime pays is proved. Another side of the story is that Maria and Jan have to live with the bad conscience. As a conclusion we can agree on the fact that crime pays as long as you do not get caught. After all, crime is bound to pay - otherwise it would not exist!

FIAB3003,3.5,3.0,,,,,"Some people say that in our modern world, dominated by science and technology and industrialisation, there is no longer a place for dreaming and imagination. What is your opinion?","
There is no room for imagination anymore, they say. Wise machines, those wicked computers, are the leading force in the modern world. People do not have to think anymore, not to mention dreaming, as everything happens in the IRONY brains of the all knowing gadgets, the divine means of information and knowledge. The heck with such selfish and conceited apparatus, I want to fight for the inner faculties of the human mind, I want to praise the diversity of personal thoughts to the skies, I want to replace all the computers with human brains and living hands. Sadly admittedly, though, it is easier said than done.
For a university student like me, computers should be like close friends, irony boxes that you can deeply rely on. Universities are the paradise for computer age; word-perfects flourish in the atmosphere of the highly developed science. A normal student spends many hours a week with his or her new friend, typing essays and letting the computer correct the mistakes. And finally - the student notices that the printer will not work or a sensitive touch to a little bit wrong button destroys the whole essay, makes the whole text disappear both from the screen and the effective irony brains. Humanly brains will not lose the idea on a push of a button, the thoughts live as long as the person wants to. That is the main differency between the hereditary brains and the brains artificially created by man. And when the printer brakes up, human hands continue writing, putting thoughts into paper.
Imagination is a many levelled capacity which can never be replaced by machines. No computer can create something new AND UNIQUE not already created in someones brains. Sure all kinds of drawing programmes or word perfects can help a person that can not use the inner imagination effectively. But simultaneously they can make the person lose the last drops of imagination and creativity, as s/he trusts blindly on the opportunities of the plastic keyboard and the unbelievably effective brains behind the shiny screen, and does not dare to listen to his or her own brains that might have something lot more sensitive, creative and human to say. Machines are not able to dream by themselves, they do not have a soul. Machines can only kill the dreams of a weak, self-conscious human being. But if the person knows his or her own inner abilities to create, imagine and think, no computer can kill the imagination.
Like a thousand years ago, a human being can still walk around dreaming. Pigeons on a roof can create a thought of a pullover with a picture of pigeons in a row to one's mind. One can dream about handsome princes and treasures even asleep. One can write poems about flowers in the spring or octopuses in the Mediterranean. One can think individual thoughts all the time, day and night. Computers can not have deep, individual thoughts. They can only take the human thoughts into their files; first thought by a person, then typed there by human hands.
In short, computers have not killed the human imagination, and they will not, as long as we use them as helpers, not as counterparts for living brains. There is no human being that does not have thoughts all the time; more or less creative - imagination and inner thoughts live forever!

I sincerely belive that those who say dreaming and imagination have no place in todays world, dominated by science, technology and industrialisation, are wrong. It may be true that these factors dominate todays world. But people have creative minds and as long as they are free to think for themselves dreams and imagining will always be a part of our lives.
I don't think that imagination and dreaming are on the decline but rather the opposite. With the development of science and technology it is today possible to imagine things unheard of before. There is always a great amount of problems which need solutions. This need spurs people to use their imagination as well as their knowledge when trying to solve old problems and any new ones which may arise. I am quite sure that all scientists dream of making important breakthroughs within their fields. Industrialists around the world are developing new and improved machinery by the minute. Technology has moved forward rapidly during the entire twentieth century due to the dreams and imagination of humans and it still continues to do so. Years ago technologists dreamt of a solar powered automobile, today this is becoming reality. Since the beginning of time man has wanted to fly, the Wright Brothers made this possible in the 1910s and today one can travel around the world by air. Even the average person dreams of a better future for him/herself. It is a part of human nature to want something bigger and better and the dreams and imagination of people is what sets them on their way to finding what they seek.
Artists use their art as a mode in which to express themselves and their dreams. Painters, sculptors, musicians and writers all need and use their imaginations constantly. The rock music of today does not write itself, no matter how bizarre and awful the final result may be there is an imagination behind it. Poets express their dreams and desires in their work. Arthur Conan Doyle's Sherlock Holmes was born of an incredibly imaginative mind as do undoubtebly all fictionous characters in the novels and stories of today. Why do people create, why do they invent things and want to study and learn many languages? - Simply because the dream of bettering themselves and making themselves known in the world. Our dreams and ambitions are the very things which drive us forward, which kindle our imaginations and make us what we are. I cannot and will not believe dreaming and imagination will ever die.
Many people have speculated about what the future holds in store for us. Some authors of futuristic novels have imagined and written frightening tales of what human society will be like in the future. Both George Orwell's ""1984"" written in 1949 and Margaret Atwood's ""The Handmaid's Tale"" written a few years ago tell of people in the future when an ""ideal"" society has been established. People have certain duties and roles to play but are not free to do as they wish. Despite this the characters, however opressed, find a way to dream their own dreams and imagine a better place or time to live.
Where would we be without our dreams and imaginations? Behind every thing invented and created by man, from the sistine chapel to a cure for cancer, lie dreams and imagination. And it would take a serious amount of brainwashing to remove them from the human mind. Who can tell what the future holds but I belive that dreaming and imagination will always be a part of us and the world we live in.

If someone were to say to me that there is no place for dreaming or imagination in the modern world I would have to disagree. First of all, without dreams and imagination the world would not be what it is today. For instance, human beings would not have dreamt of flying; no aeroplanes would have been developed. Everything is about images, in fact, first there is a vision that comes through the imagination and then a dream of realizing this imaginative occurrence. This is the way in which the modern world has been born and developed. And I do not believe that the modern world with its television-sets or computers could somehow abolish dreams or imagination.
It is, of course, understandable that questions of this kind emerge since people might feel that the human race no longer needs to visualize things like travelling to the moon or replacing human hearts by maschines. We have everything we need. Still, it is my opinion that the human being is a curious nature with a need to imagine, dream, and create. And unless people change into maschines there is no chance that the human mind is going to stay content with the present. The modern world might only be at the beginning of a much longer journey.
Seeing images come to life and dreams come true feeds the need for more successes. - We made it to the moon, whereto next! This attitude is typical of the human race. However, there are those who feel that this type of goal-setting is taking it a little bit too far. Instead of having dreams of travelling to Mars they might dream themselves away from the modern world and all its technology. And people do have the right to dream it is not somehow taken away by the modern society. The modern world should not be blamed for depriving a person of dreams or imagination.
The way I see it the technology of the modern world gives people impulses or inspiration, through artificial channels as television, radio, videos, and computers, to dream and imagine a further development of the modern world. The human element is, in fact, always present in this process. Our dreams and imagination are continously needed in this modern world. Perhaps some people feel that their visions are being ignored and this is unfortunately true.
Everyone adapts the changes at their own pace. Some modernities require longer periods of adjustment for some people. This might result in a need to preserve images of the past. Dreams of the `good old days' when everything was simple and clearcut could exemplify this type of protest against the modern world. But, still, our dreams and imagination play an important role whether we have adapted to the modern world or not.
For as long as there are human beings there are dreams and imagination. If some people feel derived of these because of science technology or industrialisation they must be very insecure in using their human abilities. I believe that one will always continue to have dreams and imagine despite of any circumstances. And it is safe to say that life would be very empty indeed without the input of the dreaming and imagination.

Modern science and technology are the realization of the dreams of generations. There were people who dreamt of flying, wondered about space, sought to find answers and understood that there is more than meets the eye. Humans have always sought to make life as easy as possible. Science, technology, and industrialisation leave free time for dreaming. They free humans from using all their time looking for food and fighting for survival and enable people to spend their time making their dreams come true, This is the triumph of the mind over the body. Instead of bodily strength modern people need intellect.
Science has brought us great cures to diseases that have plagued human beings for centuries. Thanks to science we lead longer lives free of many painful diseases. The child death rate is down and life expectancy has risen. On the other hand, death has become something strange that is feared and people find it harder to accept it as a normal part of life, because it's not omnipresent in our daily life. The dream of living forever hasn't been reached yet, but at least we live longer. Now also the weaker ones can survive.
Technology is just another means of fulfilling dreams. It is a tool, which allows us to create new worlds and express ourselves. One of the most creative aspects of technology are computers and the information highways. Inside the computer one can create new worlds that a human can also become part of (virtual reality). One can communicate with people from all over the world almost as if they were in the same room, yet without the constraints of how you look. The information highways are now available to almost everyone. A world wide web, called the Internet, is almost a growing organism in itself. It grows every day as people from all over the world contribute to it and communicate with each other. It is the embodiment of the collective dreams of a generation. Almost anything you want to know can be found with the push of a button.
Computers give us the possibility to create new synthetic worlds, but technology also gives us the chance to explore Earth and the surrounding space. Since the beginning humans have wondered what lies in space. One dream that has been fulfilled is space travel, culminating in the trip to the moon. All the expensive technology needed for making this trip might seem quite useless for the common man, yet all these high tech developments are eventually applied to everyday products. Eventually people will even be able to live in space.
Industrialisation has changed our lifestyle completely. Instead of looking for food, we look for money. Money, some people say, is the root of all evil. Nevertheless, working is factories isn't a 24 hour-a-day commitment, so people have more free time to spend as they wish.
All this technology demands great imagination from people; it demands the ability to see beyond the visible. The people who want to improve this technology need the same broadness of vision that its creators had. Although in the beginning industrialisation generated boring production line work, nowadays most of the monotonous work is done by the machines. People are needed for innovation and design. In the future we will move more and more to having small companies with people working in teams. Flexibility, imagination and a knowledge of computers give a person a competitive advantage in the work force.
These developments have also caused problems. The population of Earth has multiplied during the last century and industrialisation has brought pollution and irreversible changes to our nature. Although we might want to, we can't change the past (yet!). Some people want to live in the past. We all know how nice it is to talk about ""the good old times"". Other dreamers look into the future, making it happen. We can't go back, so hopefully we can repair the damage we have already done.
There are no boundaries to nature, it continues beyond the borders of our planet as our imagination does. Fear of the unknown has always been a human feature, but there are also those who dream of discovering new worlds and a life beyond the constraints of our bodies and our planet. No one can stop progress and prevent change. All our creations are like us humans, forever changing.

To dream is human, and imagination is the one thing that has got us where we are today. To say that there is no longer a place for dreaming and imagination in this brave modern world of ours is to say that we have reached the end of the line, that we have no place left to go. Human beings will always continue to momentarily gaze, eyes unfocused, into foggy nothingness or distant horizon, and dream. Actually, the advanced technology gives us a better change to this than anything ever before. TV, videos, computer games, to name just a few, are all tickets to imaginary worlds. Dreams for sale. And the book, the novel, is not dead either, quite the opposite in fact.
Dreaming and science are in symbiosis with each other. Without the former there could surely not be the latter. If the ancient Greeks had not dreamed about Icarus, would we have airplanes? If Columbus had not dreamed that there is land beyond the sunset, land to west of West, would anyone have found any reason to sail there? There will always be great soulful men with grand visions and dreams, and there will always be great men of science, who burn to prove that those visions and dreams are true or false. Men had visited the moon in their dreams thousands of times before it was actually done, and it has been dreamed thousands of times after that. Science fiction authors imagine unlikely futures, and to everybody's surprise the technology catches up, and afterwards those same writers, or the next generation, dream unlikely futures based upon the new discoveries. Of course, most of those dream futures stay just that, dreams, but few drive scientists into brilliant frenzies of creation, and the cycle goes on and on, to infinity. When William Gibson wrote his novel ""Neuromancer"" less than ten years ago, it was just another science fiction book. But today Virtual Reality, people being able to enter computer generated worlds via special helmets, is no longer just science fiction. Imagination is fuel to science, and vice versa.
Though times change people continue to dream. Even the basic subject of dreams stays almost the same. Granted, we no longer entertain ourselves with imaginary stories about quarrelsome gods of Olympus, but even though faces and settings change the essence of the tales does not. Not that all those old heroes and divine beings are gone. They might have been through more than a few changes during the years but Thor and Morpheus, to name just two, still go on in their continuous monthly adventures in comic books, if no where else. And are monsterous terminator cyborgs and godlike artificial intelligences of today's science fiction, or Batman and the other caped crusaders of comic books, or the Bold and the Beautiful really all that different from wrathful gods, devious dragons, knights of the round table, or the creatures of Fairyland? Heaven and Hell might have changed into virtual reality but in the Theatre of Dreams of this modern era the tales of love, hate, lust, war, sacrifice, revenge and redemption are still going strong. In a way we are fortunate that we have such a rich mythological base, accumulated through ages, to draw upon. Dreams shift and change, merge and split, turn into something new, but they never really die or disappear without leaving at least faint echoes rippling through the waves of time. Vampires and werewolves might have changed their capes and canes into boots and leather jackets, and their hoods and jewellery into sunglasses and computer wiring, but they still haunt our imagination.
Imagination is what makes us human. We have lived without technology but never without dreams. It might even be that in distant, or not so distant, future science and technology reach the point where they have been taken beyond the understanding of the common man. We dreamed when we still thought that fire was magic, and we will dream when we think so again. Come what may, people will continue to dream. Imagination has taken as this far, and it will take us to wherever it is that we are going. As for that, my imagination tells me that to say that the sky is the limit is to be too modest.

FIHE1012,3.5,2.5,,,,,All armies should consist entirely of professional soldiers: there is no value in a system of military service,"
The question whether or not all armies should consist entirely of professional soldiers is by no means an easy one to answer. Each view has its supporters, and there are indeed many good as well as bad sides to both alternatives.
There are two points of view to be taken into account before we can find a reasonable solution. First, what kind of an army serves the purposes of defence most efficiently, and second, to what extent does the chosen system respect the rights of an individual.
The efficiency of a defence system based on compulsory military service can be questioned. An army which relies on the quantity rather than quality of soldiers is bound to be inflexible. A large body of people is always more difficult to move than a small one. In a crisis situation a large number of relatively inexperienced men would probably be of less use than a smaller amount of more thoroughly trained soldiers. Besides, the amount of bureaucracy tends to grow the bigger the organization becomes. From a layperson's point of view this does not seem like a very rational way of taking care of the defence.
In a country like Finland where compulsory military service is a long-standing tradition many people have prejudices against professional army. However, armies consisting of professional soldiers have proved succesful in many other countries. A smaller number of men/women allows more flexibility, and this together with a higher level of training makes the army more efficient. The development of technology requires more and more specialized knowledge, and it is obvious that the appropriate level of expertise is more easily gained in a professional army.
From an individual's point of view a compulsory military service is clearly a violation against personal freedom. It is also strange that only men are required to do military service in a country which otherwise prides itself for being ahead of most other countries in matters of equality.
Most people want to defend their country, but the system of military service does not really give them a chance to do that according to their best abilities. Defence is more than an army, and everybody should be allowed to participate in a manner most suitable for thei individual talents and capacities. In a truly democratic society it should also be left to the individual to decide whether he or she wants to do anything at all.
The supporters of the present system frequently argue that military service is crucial for the development of a young man's character. It is undoubtedly a good thing for a boy to learn to live without his mother, but army is hardly the best place for gaining such experience. For the development of a person's character a social service of some kind would be infinitely more beneficial than learning to obey blindly and kill other people. A few months of practical work in hospitals or day-care centres might teach young people to respect life and to give them a better understanding of what it is that they are supposed to defend.
It seems obvious that a change of some kind is needed in Finland. In my opinion the present system is no good and should be done away with. Instead we should establish an army consisting of professional soldiers, or at least alter the nature of military service radically. An army of professional soldiers woulds not only defend the country more efficiently but also allow young people to choose the way they want to participate in it.

FIHE1013,3.5,3.5,,,,,"Some people say that in our modern world, dominated by science and technology and industrialisation, there is no longer a place for dreaming and imagination. What is your opinion?","
Today's world is a world of hard values. It's a world of high technology and advanced industrialisation. It seems that there is no place or time for dreaming and imagination. That is not the case, however. The hard reality we face everyday has created a need to escape, to shut out the demands of the present world and drift into another one, if only for a short time.
Using their imagination is very natural for human beings. Fantastic stories and tales have always existed and will always exist: they complete our comprehension of the reality. They add colour to it, they explain things that are hard to understand or threatening, and they entertain. Creations of our imagination relieve us from the burden of the reality too hard to be faced all the time.
People need dreams to keep up hope. If we were convinced that nothing better can ever be expected, we would not see a reason to go on. Living in dreams can be dangerous, but it can also be very important to the meaningfulness of our daily lives. Having a dream of something better helps to encounter all the difficulties of what we call the real world.
As the world becomes a harder place to live in, people escape to imagination all the more often. Fantastic films, science fiction books, all sorts of games which allow one to change identity and enter another world are tremendously popular. New religions which offer escape from reality in the form of mystical experiences are born every day. The human mind is an infinite source of imagination, and human beings feel a need to use it. Our imagination makes our lives more exciting, more interesting, more fulfilling.
One of the great powers ruling our lives is money. It is also one of the things that encourage us to dream. Entertainment is a vast business - why, then, should money object to the use of imagination? There is always a demand for fantastic films, shows and books. People want to see and read things that they know to be fantasy, it helps them to proportion the events of their reality.
Science, technology and industrialisation do not always oppose dreaming and imagination; they can be a source for imaginative works of art. For example Jules Verne, Herbert George Wells, and Vladimir Majakovski, though representatives of three different literary genres, are still examples of what I here call ""technological romanticism"". They have all found inspiration in the achievements of science and technology. Science fiction novels and films, like The Blade Runner, provide further evidence of this.
As a friend of mine said: ""If you don't know how to deal with life, life will deal with you"". Dreams keep up hope and thus help us to deal with the modern world. They keep us alive. That is why there is always place for dreaming and imagination.

FIHE1014,3.5,3.0,,,,,"Some people say that in our modern world, dominated by science and technology and industrialisation, there is no longer a place for dreaming and imagination. What is your opinion?","
It is true that the world today is very much dominated by different forms of science and technology. Machines do not exactly rule the world, but there are lots of them, especially among computers, that are needed to make it possible for us to carry out our daily routines. Machines do most of the hard work for us, and today more and more people need computers at their work. People have bought certain programs that instantly make the computer do what they need, and this may make someone feel that not only does the computer do all the work for its owner, but that the computer does all the thinking for him just as well. And the dominance of technology continues when the person gets home from work and wants to relax. He turns on the old TV-set and lets his brain be washed by the soap operas that even tell him when he sees something funny.
A sad picture, but are things really this bad? Is this really what a modern world means, or what inevitably comes with it? If that is the case, I think it is high time we redefine the concept modern. I think that a modern world is a world that does not stop developing, one that is constantly on the move. A world that shuts out human creativity and the possibilities of human mind does not develop, it stops and stays where it is. In my opinion the human imagination is the greatest resource there is, and that there will always be place for dreaming. However capable we think computers are, the fact is that they still can not replace people. Computers, as well as other machines are suitable for carrying out certain set patterns of work, but they are not capable of creating anything new, because they can not think for themselves. People are different from machines, but what is so exceptional is that people are also different from each other. Every single human being is very special, and has his own special talents. And what comes to developing these talents, the only limit is imagination... which, in my opinion does not have limits. People need dreams - not only those dreams we see when we sleep and that are essential for our health - but also daydreams. Dreams can take us away from the little sorrows of our everyday life, they can give us ideas - no matter how foolhardy - that are at least worth considering in relity. In our dreams we dare to do and things that we say we really would not dream of doing, but is that not quite all right? We might overestimate our abilities in our dreams, but who then would encourage us to try difficult things, if not we ourselves? We need to free our minds in order to make it develop and produce ideas to improving our lives and ourselves as people.
Television has often been blamed for extinguishing our imagination, almost for causing brain damage. I do not feel that all TV programs should be categorized as having an equally bad influence. Some of them actually do make us think and use our imagination, and there are ones that do not work at all if the audience just sits back and is being a vegetable. An example of these would be old horror movies and thrillers, where it is actually the viewer's own imagination that creates the most horrifying aspects, when the viewer tries to guess what will happen next or what if it had happened that way. And, occasionally I do not see nothing wrong in tuning in on the Bold and the Beautiful and letting our otherwise so very hard working brain have a rest.

FIHE1019,2.5,2.0,,,,,Most university degrees are theoretical and do not prepare students for the real world. They are therefore of very little value,"
Once in a while I have heard people argue that the university degrees are theoretical and take too much distance from the real world with its practicies. The degrees are of very little value as a whole.
At first sight the argument does make some sense: it is the easiest and most conventional view to have as far as universities, degrees, values or education on the academic branch are conserned. So, there is an opinion to point out even though people would know nothing about the realities of the subject matter. There is no one thing that would suggest another type of attitude towards the argument: people can simply answer ""yes"" or ""no"" - whether they agree or not. The title includes only few words that should be strong enough to show the real nature of things on this special branch of the educational life - a life, which is used to theorizing and evaluating more than holding on opinions.
On the basis of the title argument it might be right to expect academic studies lead to an end where graduates more clearly find themselves professionals to be, at least, instead of being fed up with theories and values that would never do anywhere. There is no easy way to point out in solving problemacy of the academic education. What would be relevant or what would count as important are matters to solve for those more acquainted with the academic conventions.
As for the title, one important point for me might be trying to realize the meaning of the two sentences in the title and take different views on them.
The title argues that most degrees are theoretical. ""Most"" suggests that ""not all"" degrees are theoretical. If the title is changed so that not all university degrees are theoretical to the extreme, there would be a different way to handle the subject as a whole. The same method can be used for the other arguments in the title: what is the real world to prepare for like and which are the values that would make the academic degrees less important.
As to the value argument, it would also be necessary to find out, what those unimportant university degrees with minor values would be.
A university would not be a university without theories of a higher education and values of science: scientific thought and experimental practicies belong there. There are other institutions of the higher education with more practical forms of studying that prepare students for their working careers - if there will be any work to find in Finland or somewhere else.
Many basic university degrees prepare students for educational work at the different levels of the Finnish school system. University degrees contain theoretical parts on subjects for the undergraduates to study and the graduates, then, to teach after qualification. Subjects to get acquainted with demand plenty of time and work in several years: there is no easy way out of the university for an academic student who will come back to the real world qualified with a degree.
Leaving the university without a degree has been a real problem on branches of the higher education such as the Social Sciences and the Humanities.
Something is happening in the Finnish school- and educational system. Reforms are discussed throughout the educational system - also at the level of the higher education. Possibilities to study further are opened up for new groups of students and new, more practical, non-scientific forms of education preparing for professions and deepening knowledge on more practical branches have been started in recent years. Maybe this would make one real answer to the argument of the educational values as to the university degrees and the real world the students should live in.

FIHE1022,3.5,3.5,,,,,Most university degrees are theoretical and do not prepare students for the real world. They are therefore of very little value,"
This is a claim that is often being made, especially by people who criticize the university system. I agree that university degrees are theoretical, but I think that it does not necessarily mean that they would be of little value in real life. Quite the contrary. I would like to argue that the concentration of theory is actually very useful and valuable, both for the individual and the society in general.
The way I see it, the less theoretical education, say, for example, vocational education, is no more successful in preparing students for ""the real life"" than the more theoretical university education is. The vocational training typically tells the student exactly what to do and how. It gives ready made solutions to problems, so the student who has completed vocational education has not usually learned how to deal with unexpected problems or situations. And as we know things seldom work out the way one expects, and we often find ourselves facing an unexpected problem. The university education, on the other hand, prepares students especially for these unexpected situations. University education encourages students to personal interpretation of situations and individual problem solving. It familiarizes students with different methods and theories, different perspectives and ways of solving problems. It demands the students to be more independent and requires more creativity from the students themselves, than the less theoretical education, and I see these abilities as very important in the real life.
The claim often goes that the vocational education is much better because it prepares students for their specific professions. Some things a university degree might not be able to give us. These might include such routine skills as correct telephone conduct, or how to repair a copy machine, that are needed in most jobs today. Instead of these mechanical skills the university education gives us something much more useful; it enhances our mental capacities and develops our creative problem solving abilities. And is thus, in my opinion, much more useful in the long run. When talking about employment we must also take into consideration the fact university degree is usually a requirement for the top posts, in which case university education is very useful indeed.
In addition to the benefits that university education has in securing high level employment, we must also look at its value to the individual in his private life. The university teaches us to understand various spectra of life more fully, whereas vocational education seldom has opportunities for this. The Finnish university degree in particular gives us both all-round education, and a deeper and more detailed understanding of one or two fields. When we study at university level we learn the know-how of collecting information, processing and analysing it. We learn how to theorize, and how to perceive larger structures behind the fractured information that is being poured to us. We are able to examine information critically, to question things and not accept them at face value. A person who has gone through the vocational education system does not have these tools at his use. Therefore he may sometimes feel that he the real life does not make any sense to him, and feelings of alienation might result from this.
A further example of how university education prepares us for the real life, and how it is beneficial, is the fact that educated people tend to be more active in the society, by belonging to different organisations and voting actively. Due to their educational background these individuals realise their potential of making their voice heard, and that they really can influence decision making in the society. So university education is actually very valuable from the society's point of view as well, and not merely from the individual's.

FIHE1024,4.0,,,,,,"In his novel ""Animal Farm"" George Orwell wrote ""All men are equal but some are more equal than others"". How true is this today?","
George Orwell's statement about equality still applies to any society in the world. In spite of different laws and declarations ""some are more equal than others"". Though some countries are ahead of others in this respect, no society is free from some kind of discrimination whether it concerns sex, race, political and religious views or social hierarchies.
One of the most discriminated group is women whose position - whether it is good or bad - is always worse than that of men. In India, a woman who has dared to give birth to a girl against her husbands will is usually despised and socially isolated, having no hope for a better future. In most developing countries, women's education is neglected or practically forbidden although it could solve many of the problems those countries are undergoing. In muslim countries, a woman is nothing but a possession of her husband, father or other male relative whose control over her life knows no limits. Women have to be taroets for their owners' fears, aggressivity and other dark sides. Though much better, the situation in western countries is far from perfect. For all women for example equal pay and equal chance to make a career are not reality. Instead, sexism has survived most of the laws and restrictions meant to promote equality.
Another widespread -ism, racism, also proves the idea of equality between men false. Race, like sex, is something innate and visible, which easily stamps a person with prevailing stereotypies. Therefore, it is also easy to pick out a group to be looked down on no matter what its members are like as individuals. When this happens to some group, it is sure to alienate and be isolated, which has of course only negative consequences, usually bringing about a vicious circle. For example gypsies, at least in Finland, are always accused of stealing but usually their chances to get proper work are very limited because of their race.
Nowadays, the hope for racial equality is especially threatened by the rise of neo-nazism in many European countries. Scapegoals for economic depression and other social problems must be get rid of - one excuse for attacking racial minorities. It seems as if people always had to find a group they could consider inferior or guilty of all problems. Ironically, proof of the justification of discrimination has been tried to draw from reasoning, religion and history though they all are absolutely against it.
Both sexual and racial unequality partly contributes to a third disproportion. The world is still - perhaps more than ever - divided and dividing into the rich and the poor. In countries with inadequate social security system, poverty is almost inevitably inherited, which leads to remarkable social unequality. Having no or little money tends to mean lack of education as well as lack of justice. Parents cannot afford to let their children go to school, even if it were free, because they need the money the children can earn. The poorest people are also taken advantage of since they have no money to hire a lawyer or bribe the judge. Too often, the life of the poorest is nothing but slavery.
Though only scratching the surface, the examples above show how far we are from equality - even today. And I believe that tomorrow will not change much; the priviledged are not likely to grow less reluctant to have things changed. However, the black would never have got civil rights or women right to vote if unjustice and unequality were immune to the persistant work of masses and individuals.

FIHE1025,3.0,2.5,,,,,All armies should consist entirely of professional soldiers: there is no value in a system of military service,"
The question if an army is needed and in particular an army which consists of nonprofessionals is needed is debatable. In my points of view I shall be focusing on the Finnish army.
As I understand the war is not anymore what it was 50 years ago. Noone will be skiing over the other country's border and shooting the enemy with a gun. Today the question is about an atomic war and weapons which have to do with it. These weapons are not for boys who are not used to them.
The idea of the army earlier and probably still is to change young boys into men and to teach them how to shoot, be cooperative etc. In todays world these are of course important issues, but not in the wars of today. Finland invests a lot of money into these boys. And for what? This does not help the recession at all. It is expensive to feed the boys and pay for their equipment. Most of the army boys are on leeds half of their army time, because the army does not have enough money to keep them during weekends. Instead of working and earning a living or being in school these boys are in the army. From my point of view it would be more important to have these boys working and educating themselves.
There are two possibilities: service of eight months or service of eleven months. The latter one is the one which is appretiated, it is how society looks at it. Before entering the army boys are divided into A and B boys, already if you have weak eyesight you are a B-boy and inferior to A-boys.
Anyway, these boys are trained to be soldiers. This training is mentally stressful and for some boys absolutely too stressful, they are not able to cope with it. The army looks after the strong ones. The strong shall survive who cares about the weak ones, of course at this point the boys learn to look after each other, you do not leave a friend behind. In an emergency situation how many of these soldiers would really be prepared to act? How many would get scared in such a situation? Can you rely on these soldiers? As mentioned earlier these groups of soldiers consist of all kinds of boys. Professional soldiers would surely be more reliable in emergency situations.
Professional soldiers consist of group who are doing what they see as improtant, what they want to do. Mentally these soldiers would be prepared for different kinds of situations. The slogan ""only the strongest and fittest survive"" would be in its place. Competition is good for professional soldiers. These soldiers would be paid for their job just as firemen and policemen are.
Some women are interested in an army career. Now it would be possible for them, women could be just as tough fighters as men are, if just trained. In Israel also women join the army. An experiment of women in the army was recently done in Finland and the results were good.
The obligatory Finnish military service is a tradition which has been going on for years. It is not something the patriotic men want to give up. But thinking of how little purpose this military service has in today's world, why keep it alive.

FIHE1026,3.5,3.5,2.5,,,,The prison system is outdated. No civilized society should punish its criminals: it should rehabilitate them,"


After having been released from prison, the average criminal commits another crime. Prison sentence has not reformed him; on the contrary, he leaves the prison even more embittered and hostile towards society. It's virtually impossible for him to start a new life as a good citizen. Who or what are prisons for, then? I believe that instead of punishing its criminals, society should rehabilitate them. Our prison system doesn't serve anyone, and therefore it should be abolished.
Some people claim that we do need the prison system - to prevent crimes, they say. They believe that if there were no prison sentences to be expected, the crime rate would increase and the situation would get out of hand. But isn't it pathetic! What morals are those according to which only what is followed by punishment is a crime? Morals should never be based on incomprehensible norms, but on absolute values, values true and timeless. Only then would people know what it means to commit a crime. Crime is not what is forbidden; crime is what violates the values people believe in. We must not accept that people behave themselves merely for fear of punishment.
Besides, punishment is not what criminals need. Those who commit crimes are not strong and courageous; they are weak and miserable. Isn't it self-evident that they should not be locked up in prison like animals, but guided back to society. Most often they simply need love, caring and encouragement, and moral instruction. And it goes without saying that if everyone could get the love, the caring, the encouragement and the instruction even as a child, no one would become a criminal. I'm not saying that criminals who are dangerous to those around them could be set free, but we should never imprison anyone just as a punishment.
The point I am making is that punishing criminals isn't acceptable at all. We all know revenge leads to no good. Why, then, have we got this prison system - the model example of revenge? It's high time we abolished that immoral institution; otherwise we cannot regard our society as civilised!
Oh yes, I am an utopian. I believe in humanity because I think it's indispensable. If we didn't believe in ourselves, how could anything ever be changed? Everyone - even the realists who are reading this with growing scepticism - should stop to think what the world would be like if we all were humanists. Nobody would write essays on prison systems...

FIHE1028,3.0,,,,,,"In the words of the old song: ""Money is the root of all evil""","
""How can gambling be wrong when you win this much?"" This was the embarrassed comment of a British clergyman to the press after he had won 214.000 on pools. In his charmingly honest confusion, this priest actually gave a down-to-earth expression to a problem which troubles many people throughout the civilized world: Is money the cause of all evil? Should one, at any cost, try to avoid possessing more money than is needed for one's daily bread and monthly rent?
Indeed, it is often said that money is the root of all evil. In actual fact, however, this well-known phrase is a misquotation of the biblical verse in 1. Timothy 6:10 which calls the love of money the root of all evil. Regardless of what we think of the Christian Holy Scripture and its authority, most of us probably agree with the idea that money in itself is nothing but paper and metal; in other words, money as such is not a mysterious essence with a magic power of its own, but an instrument used and accepted in human beings' transactions for goods and services in most parts of the world. Money is merely a medium of exchange with the help of which we can purchase things in order to satisfy our needs and desires.
Hence, the crucial point is not money as such but our attitude towards it. This attitude, in turn, manifests itself, first, in the means which we are willing to use to get more money, and, secondly, in the ways in which we spend the money that we already have.
To simplify, one can say that there two kinds of ways to deal with money, namely, self-interested ways and disinterested ways. To make the matter a little more complicated, one might add that there are also different opinions as to which of these two courses is wiser to take. From the point of view of peace and balance in society, however, it seems readily apparent that it is reasonable, to say the least, to guarantee some kind of basic income for everyone. As the English writer Samuel Butler puts it:  The question of self-interested and disinterested use of money is a tough one. In modern society, most us probably agree that everyone has the fundamental right to use their money to satisfy their basic needs. But even in the case of a statement as simple as this we run into difficulties. What are these ""basic needs""? Food, clothes, accommodation and health care, certainly. But what kind of food? What kind of clothing? A flat or a house? A GP at a public health care centre or a specialized physician in a private hospital? And once we go beyond the word ""basic"", the difficulties become even greater. What can we buy for ourselves without going against our conscience, or against what should be our conscience? How much of our income are we supposed to give to charities - one percent, as the modern charity movement claims, or ten percent, as is commanded by the old Judaeo-Christian tradition?
There are no simple answers. We all must search for own solutions - and to be ready to modify them, when needed. In so doing, it is important to bear in mind that the responsibility for the decisions we make is ours alone. We cannot blame a faceless entity called ""money"" for the evil things which take place in our world. Money as such is neither good nor evil. It is us who use it for either good or evil ends.

FIHE2001,3.5,3.5,,,,,Crime does not pay,"
A murderer always returns to the scene of his crime. This is the claim that we have heard many times in connection with detective stories or TV series. The return of the criminal is the final clue that helps the police solve the case. In real life, this might not be referred to in such a dramatical way, and homicides are not committed every day, but the fact remains that all crimes get solved eventually, and the criminal will have to carry the consequences of his deed. A crime might be easy to commit, but it is much harder to take the responsibility for your actions. In other words, crime does not pay.
In our society, a person who has done something criminal is judged very harshly. It might seem harmless to stick one little chocolate bar in your pocket while shopping in the grocery store, but shoplifting looks no better on a person's criminal record than anything else done illegally.
Furthermore, many young people are encouraged to get involved in drugdealing or prostitution as a means of earning a good amount of money fast. It actually leads on to a vicious circle of trying to hide from authorities, landing in debt and trying to pay it off by selling more drugs or working longer hours selling your own body. The result is that even more precautions have to be taken so the police will not discover what is happening; and so on.
The police also has to deal with heavier crimes, but it is essential to start at the very root of the case to possibly prevent things growing out of hand. Even a murderer or a bank robber might have started off on a small scale, earning his living as a pickpocket, then going on to weaponed assault, and finally, killing people or robbing banks. The same circle pattern is repeated, only in different proportions.
Getting out of the vicious circle is another thing. In some cases, it might not stop even if a person is convicted for his crime, and it continues after he has paid his fine or is released from jail. But the sentence will be no milder the second time, and there is seldom any possibility of getting away with it, as the authorities keep a closer eye on somebody who has already done it once. Also, the number of cases that are never solved is very small, so there is virtually no way of escaping the law and our system.
However, it might be argued that our system does not work very efficiently when it comes to fighting against crime, because crime still exists. The problem is that the proportions of objectionable behavior have grown so big in modern society that it is impossible to prevent all crime. There has always been bad morals and there always will be. But does that make an excuse for committing a crime? Does not a person, in fact, ruin his own life aswell as that of his victim by breaking the law and good ethics?
The problem cannot, however, be discussed on only one level. There are several different things that one has to take into account. For instance, the criminal might have been ""temporarily insane"", or very confused, when committing the crime. But those are arguments for the defence in the courts of law, and there is no denying that the person still has broken against the rules under which our society is working.
In conclusion, we can see that our society is dealing with a complex issue when it comes to crime. Rome was not built in a day, and similarly the conflict of good social conduct versus bad behavior cannot be solved anytime soon. But there is one thing we can be sure of: the law will never start approving of crime, so crime does not pay.

Technology can put man on the Moon, and has in fact done so. We can travel around the world a lot faster today than we could in Phileas Fogg's time. The AIDS vaccine may be just around the corner, thanks to advanced medical technology, which has already made heart-transplants and the curing of many once-lethal illnesses possible.
Listen to that: going to the Moon, travelling around the world, illnesses cured - science and technology seem indeed to have the answers. But stop and think. An answer presupposes a question. So who puts the questions to technology, to the scientists and inventors? We do. People. And in order to pose a question we must have curiosity, and not only that but the thought, the dream of possible answers. And the researchers themselves must have imagination in order to look for answers where no-one else has looked before. Without imagination, there would be no science, no technology.
But even that is just one aspect of the important role imagination has to play in the drama of the modern world. Regardless of who is behind technology and industry, those two have caused a lot of pain and suffering; the atomic bomb and other highly efficient weapons have been developed and used; technological know-how has given Europe and North America the power to make the South poor, and then the financial strength to impose their values on their poor cousin. And this is where the real improtance of imagination comes in.
It is not only a question of ""what technology can do for you"", but also a question of what you must do to keep technology and the concentration of power in check. Without people who have dreams and imagination, who see further than the next scientific breakthrough, no laws will be made to make sure technology does not stop being servant and becomes master of the modern world.
Technology is a tool, not a value of and in itself. But that is only the big picture. For a researcher, say a nuclear physicist, trying to find out the absolute truth about what happens inside an atom is a value in itself - it is his job, which he presumably cares deeply about. That's the detail, the little cog in the machinery that makes up technology and science. And the big picture is where the visionaries, the dreamers and the prophets are needed: to tell the scientists and technocrats how far they can be allowed to go.
The scientist will concentrate on the detail, on the job at hand, and needs only to have the imagination to look for the answers to specific questions. The visionary must see the ramifications of scientific breakthroughs yet unmade, must stretch his imagination beyond technology, not into a utopia, but into the modern world.

FIJO1034,3.0,,,,,,"In the words of the old song: ""Money is the root of all evil""","
Money is quite an old invention. According to archaelogical discoveries, the oldest metal coins that are ever found date back to 6000 BC. Earlier, there have been other means of payment, for example, animals, skins of animals, furs and, occasionally, even human-beings have served as a payment in rituals of ancient tribes. Regardless of lack of pieces of evidence, there is reason to assume that money, or its' various substitutes, have existed as long as there has been life on earth. From this historical point of view, money seems to be one of the necessities of life, almost like eating, and there hardly is a thing which, in the course of centuries, has not been measured in terms of money.
The material value of money is unimportant and its' usage is based on a generally accepted agreement which makes it a medium of exchange. For this purpose, money is very practical, one may think, sometimes even too practical. Anyway, we have learned that living in a modern society is practically impossible without some money. Nevertheless, the latest news flashes of our countrymen standing in queues to get free bread suggest that, if there is no other choice, a new mode of living can be adopted in no time at all. This, at least, proves that people are quick learners, even in older age, unlike what is often claimed. Certainly, we all hope that this new, or better say old, trend is not going to spread like an epidemic and, that remedies will soon be found to ease the present situation. I wonder, what do these people think, in their case, having faced an economical collapse, is the root of all evil. Answers would certainly vary but I doubt if anyone would accuse money.
In reality, I think, this phrase ""money is the root of all evil"" is an evidence of our tendency to avoid calling things and fenomena with their right names. In the title, instead of money, it would be better if we talked about greed or other human weaknesses. Blaming money on something, as if it was a living thing with own will, is an impersonal and, therefore, safer way to make a point. In song lyries, this approach is maybe more pleasant and so, the piece may sell better. Unfortunately, this song is not familiar to me and, on the basis of one line, the full message of the lyricist remains unclear. Song writers are often ambitious and, if they succeed well, the joy of realizing the real message, which is often between the lines, is left to listeners. In this manner, the song writes may even manage to educate people and make them think, for example, the relationship of money and evil. Unfortunately, some men of action draw quite liberal conclusions, and they end up robbing banks and shops or whatever there is available. Some of them are unrepenting professionals who commit a crime while security systems monitor their graceful movements. The others a plain tinkers and, therefore, their chances to remain uncaught, unlike the professinals', are worse. The motives of these people vary a lot but, as many of these cases remain unsolved, the whole collection of these amazing stories will never be revealt. Instead of police files, these secrets find their way to graveyards.
Robberies represent one extremity and they get a lot of publicity which, by no means, is always proportional to the gains obtained by the robbers. In more sophisticated fraud operations, which usually take place in business world, millions slip into wrong pockets and nobody asks a question. The question of the role of money, in these illegal affairs, is a totally futile one and answering it would lead us nowhere. In every single case, individuals decide to take action, often after carefull consideration and planning, in hope to get more money than they would otherwise be able to get. We, in the western society, have become consumers and some of us simply want to consume more than the others. Those who are very much attracted to materialistic values, may get confused as new needs are created all the time. As a result of this, to sustain an expensive mode of living, some people resort to extreme measures rather than cut their expenses. As opposite to these problems, there are people who have not get properly started with their life. Due to the unemployment, some people may find that their future prospects are hopeless and, as they have nothing to lose, they become criminals.
As a matter of fact, where there is life, there are the roots of evil, too. Nowadays, a very serious problem is that there is an increasing number of people who can't find a place in society. What will be their contribution to the future and, in general, how can people keep pace with the rapid changes in the world. It is often said that, during the past years, people have lost part of their values of life which, gradually, have been replaced with artificial and more fashionable ones. Quite recently, we lived a period of constant economical growth, which as an idea was quite promising but, as we have seen lately, this proved out to be a fallacy. In the future, we will see what is left after all bubbles are gone.

It has been said that in our modern world there is no place for dreams and imagination. That people are far too busy to have time to dream. That modern science technology and industrialization have left people with no imagination in cold surroundings.
It might be true that people are busy today, that there is not as much time for fantasy as there may have been some decades ago. On the other hand, a long time ago when people cultivated their own soil and kept cattle to feed and cloth their family, they must have had even less free time to sit down and fancy. Therefore we are likely to have better opportunities to sit back and dream while the microwave oven cooks instant meals and the dishwasher takes care of our dirty dishes. It can well be said, that technology is helping us when it comes to dreaming. Surely television, unlike books, has a passivating influence on people; picture tells it all leaving very little to be imagined. The massmedia brings horrifying reality to our knowledge. Wars, terrorism, pollution and starvation, all kinds of disasters are closer to people causing tension and frustration as people feel themselves incapable of changing the course the human race has taken. But it is also a fact that imagination is the natural resource that flourishes the most, and when life itself feels hard, people escape to dreaming. In the depths of slum an in the middle of a war or surrounded by a totally polluted environment, imagination offers moments of relief. Or in the opposite case, imagination can give a good kick to otherwise too peaceful being.
The modern science technology has been blamed for making people too realistic, and to some extent, immune to imaginary stories. If this was true, the movie industry would not be profitable as it is. The old films, to a viewer of our time, seem ridiculous and childish, but the new films with similar imaginary stories located to modern world seem to interest almost everyone. The science technology, naturally, has had a great influence on films as well as on literature and any form of art. Therefore the science technology and the unlimited possibilities in research have expanded the limits of our imagination. Any new discovery brings new possibilities and therefore feeds our imagination by offering new dimension our imagination can wander around. The stimulating effect of scientific achievements can be seen in space adventure movies and read in science fiction books. Science technology adds to our imagination, and other way around, there would not be scientific discoveries if there were not ""crazy scientists"" with vivid imagination and big dreams.
As science technology, the industrialization has been claimed to kill imaginativeness of people. However, there is another way of viewing industrialization, too. As people are more tied to timetables and have become sort of pieces of a huge production- and profit-plan, they need imagination even more. Dreaming becomes more important when every day of one's life is similar to the day before.
I think that imagination and dreams will never cease to be the most comforting factors in human life. We dream for various reasons. Sometimes we imagine things just to escape from reality for a short moment. Dreams tend to stay quite similar throughout times. People have always dreamt of a ""better life"", whatever it means to different individuals. Some dream of having money and power, some imagine themselves in different situations with people they will probably never meet, for example filmstars. Some imagine what it would like to be someone else, somewhere else. Dreams come in all shapes and in all colors. It is natural for people to dream and imagine, these two functions are a part of thinking and thinking can not be stopped by any outside influence like science technology or industrialization. Dreams and fantasies are important to us, not only because of the pleasure they provide us with, but also because of their great influence to our mental well-being. We could not give up our dreams because we are human, our dreams and our imagination separates us from animals so how could anything we ourselves have invented work against us by ruining something that is crucial to us?

Some people say that in our modern world, dominated by science, technology and industrialisation there is no longer a place for dreaming and imagination. This is not the case; we can see results of people's imagination everywhere around us, and some of them, like the car or the telephone or the aphabet or the zipper are extremely important to us. The use of imagination is as necessary in scientific work as in creating art and it is also needed in everyday life.
Without imagination the world would stop since there would be no development or reforms. If people would not always have dreamt of a better world or an easier living there would not be all that highly developed science and technology today. Naturally dreams alone would not take us very far unless we are willing to take steps towards realizing them.
However, imagination is important for us not only because we can use it to create new revolutionary theories or something more concrete but also because we can pass time and forget our worries for a while by daydreaming. Without that possibility for escape life could sometimes be unbearable.
The appreciation for imagination in our modern world can be seen most clearly in art. Every year representatives of different art forms are given well known awards like Oscars or the Nobel prize for literature. And the gigantic movie industry is a dream land in itself: it creates dreams for us. We do not need to dream ourselves if we do not want to and if we do, we are told what we should be dreaming of.
Money, love, sex, adventure - in the films we see the same elements that are present in most of our dreams. The heroes and heroines live in a world of many possibilities and happy coincidences. We can put ourselves in their position and there it is: a perfectly good dream in flashy colours without much effort. Millions of people share the same dreams of prehistoric adventures in Jurassic Park or of love that conquers all in some faraway country where they do not know words like poverty and depression.
Movies and ads show us what to dream of today and tomorrow and what we could do (wear, eat, drink, listen to) to make those dreams come true. There are numbers of people who even make their living out of dreams; models, beauty queens, actors, writers and advertising artists, to mention some of them. And many people do not notice that they are living their lives in somebody else's dream.
In our dreams we reach for the stars and luckily there are people who are capable of making their, or other people's wildest dreams come true. Imagination is an inborn part of us and no matter how far science and technology will develop it will remain an important factor in our world until humans have been replaced by a more rational life form and there are different ways of making progress.

FIJO1038,3.5,2.0,,,,,The prison system is outdated. No civilized society should punish its criminals: it should rehabilitate them,"
When discussing the topic of prison system , it is clear that the subject is vast and diversified if all different systems and circumstances that exist are taken into consideration. So I intend to focus on the situation mainly from the Finnish point of view.
The prison system has developed over the past decades, let alone the past centuries. In modern prisons circumstances are more human: cells (or rooms) are normally fairly comfortable, often having conviniences such as television, coffee-machine, personal things etc. Prisoners have better possibilities for hobbies, studying and meeting visitors. No longer are prisoners kept on bread and water, though these kind of expressions stay in language. In general, people usually have a little knowledge of how prisons operate; it is only a small minority of people who ever come into contact with the prison system.
There are several disadvantages in the prison system. Firstly, the time spent in an oppressive and tough atmosphere of a prison often has a bad influence on prisoners, especially on young ones. Secondly, convicts find it hard to adjust to normal social life again - the longer the sentence, the harder the adjustment. For example, in a case where an imprisonment breaks up the family, the result can be a vicious circle: once in prison it is easier to become a recidivist. Furthermore, prisons are expensive institutions to sustain. The money spent on the cost of maintenance of prisons would be more useful if spent on rehabilitation.
The purpose of imprisonment is to punish a person who has committed a crime, the punishment being a loss of one's liberty. Although the imprisonment rarely is a pleasant experience, it must be taken into account that for some people, so called outsiders, - though they are minority - a prison offers better conditions and standard of living than they would have living in casual wards or in the streets lacking food, warmth etc. These people commit crimes in order to be put in prison; instead they should be provided with cheap accommondation and efficient social care.
Various alternatives must be established if the prison system is to be annulled. It can be taken for granted, that general opinion and moral require some kind of penalty. The system of imposing a fine should not be extended, because money can not and ought not to compensate everything. Fines also place people in unegual positions according to their wealth. Mediation is a solution as a form of penalty: there has been encouraging experiences especially among young criminals. In a mediation the criminal and the victim of a crime negotiate with the help of a third person whether damage and injuries could be compensated, for example by working. This system has the advantage that the criminal has to meet the victim and face what he/she has done. When put straight to prison, a young criminal may not always realize the connection between the crime and the penalty. The situation is the same with suspended sentences. It does not feel like a penalty: one can go on living like before nearly without any obligations.
One of the alternative penalties instead of imprisonment is community service which have features in common with the mediation. The community service means that a criminal has to do some generally useful work. Advantages are many: necessary work is done, the community saves in expencies, the criminal is given a chance to do something useful instead of passive stay in prison.
However, in some cases imprisonment can be considered as the only possible alternative, as in most cases in which a felony, for instance a murder, a rape or an assault, has been violently committed. It is the responsibility and duty of a society to protect its members some way; we would be living in a worse jungle without any laws and control. Another question is, could there be some better institutions where those who have committed crimes could be rehabilitated; the prison certainly does not do that.
The answer to the question in the topic is no, in the sense that people - general public - and the community are not yet ready for such a big change, which will acquire new legislation, education, new institutions etc. in order to replace the prisons etc. Bot most of all, attitudes must become much more liberal, which is hardly to be expected, because of the amount of crimes is increasing. Recent news in newspapers seem to confirm this: in the USA, politicians are claiming for more severe sentences and building up new prisons (the old ones being very overcrowded); while in Finland it is suggested that young prisoners should be kept in prison for a longer time, whereas prisoners with a life sentence could be put on probation. The prison system needs to be reformed further on: more rehabilitation and stimulation instead of punishment. A good example is the experiment where each guard is appointed a few prisoners to whom he/she is supposed to pay special attention - in a positive aspect.

FIJY1001,3.0,3.0,,,,,All armies should consist entirely of professional soldiers: there is no value in a system of military service,"
We in Finland are just getting a law that also women can do military service as volunteers. This has caused a lot of disagreements between different political parties and other intrest groups - even to a degree when one starts suspecting that the whole issue was brought up now primarely to make people forget certain more important issues. Anyway, I think it is a good starting point towards a more sensible military system, one that would be based on voluntariness of both sexes.
Then what makes me think this kind of system would work in a small coutry? Would there be enough volunteers to quarantee our security? I think yes, as long as we are ready to provide these people with the same benefits as all the other state employees; a reasonable salary, promotion possibilitys etc. The only obvious disadvantage is the fact that we can't let these people quit quite as freely as in so-called normal jobs, after all, we have no use for an army that will quit as soon as a conflict arrises. A reasonable way to deal with this would be making the contract for 4 years at the time - during which you are not allowed to quit. Also quitting would be forbidden if the country is in a war. How we could afford this system whitout increasing taxes (God knows we pay enough as it is) is by reducing the size of the army. We'll manage to keep up the same level of defence with considerably smaller amount of people because, unlike young guys who are forced into service against their will, these people would be highly motivated professionals. I for one would feel much safer.
We do not choose where we are born so being punished for it is totally unreasonable. And that's what it is these days, a punishment for young guys to be forced into the army against their will, and unfortunately also sometimes agaist everything they believe in, their religion or pasifism. Yes, sure there is another option, civil service, but if you believe that is wrong also, if ou want to have absolutely nothing to do with the whole unhuman system, what then? With growing shame I have read about several idealistic young guys who have been sent to prison for just that, for holding on to what they believe is right. How is this possible, I ask myself, in a country sucs as Finland? A counry that teatches us already in nursery school to believe in peace? If that isn't having double standars, nothing is.
Working as a professional soldier is a dangerous occupation. But then again there are a lot of dangerous occupations in this world and still there are people who do it; and actually it is propaply much more dangerous to work as a policeman in New York city than as a soldier in Finland. All we need now is political will to do a good thing for a change.

FIJY1002,3.5,2.5,,,,,All armies should consist entirely of professional soldiers: there is no value in a system of military service,"
I hate war. I fear it more than anything else. But I believe in self-defence. I am ready to defend my country by force of arms. I think I owe it those almost 100.000 Finns who died in 1939-45 defending this country. I also think that it is every citizen's duty to defend his/her country. In one way or another.
A common topic in the Finnish media has been, and still is, whether women should have the right to a military service. The right, not a duty. In my opinion, if a woman really so desires, she should have the possibility of the armed service. But still, and I don't mean to underestimate women in any ways, the idea of a woman dashing and crawling against the enemy with an assault rifle in her hands seems very strange to me. After all, there are other ways of defending one's country. The women's auxiliary defence services had a great role during the war fifty years ago. A fact which is often forgotten. But women's armed service could work just fine. It does work in Israel, so why not elsewhere?
The proposal for a Finnish army of professional soldiers has got a little less attention. As a substitute of the whole system of national service it can't even be taken seriously. In superpowers like the USA that kind of hired troops are sufficient, but not in small countries like Finland. It has been suggested though, that we could have hired troops together with the national service system. That small army of professional soldiers could be used as part of the UN's forces on combat areas around the world, in a way, fighting for peace. That would be quite another thing. But the replacing of the national service with professional soldiers only would be an unconsidered act. In a country of a few million people it would be impossible to gather up an adequate army out of volunteers. It would also be pretty absurd to leave the defending of a country to a few passionate patriots.
I see the system of national service, in any country, as a uniting factor. A shared will to defend the country keeps the people together and therefore this system is worth preserving. Besides that, for small countries it is the only way to maintain the credibility of their defensive forces. It would be foolish and probably fatal for any nation to say: ""We don't have any enemies. Why should we need an army?"" President Thomas Jefferson had many ideas about the army. In a sense, he was right saying: .

FIJY1008,2.5,2.0,,,,,Crime does not pay,"
A friend of mine once got drunk on a friday night, as the custom was and got the idea to steal his neighbours brand-new car and go for a ride in it. We had been drinking together that night with some friends and when he introduced his bright idea, all of us were very against it. But we lost him that night in the city and the next day I heard that he had stolen a car, not the neigh-bour's, and had been caught by the police after speeding and trying to escape from them. He was given a conditional sentence lasting one month.
That is probably my closest encounter with crime and it clearly shows that crime does not pay. In my friend's case crime did not pay, I guess you could say that he had to pay for his crime. But for some people crime does pay and for some it pays a lot.
Let's take drug related crime, for instance. The people who use drugs are criminals, but they don't gain anything by using drugs, they only lose. They lose their health, their job, their money. But the other participants of drug criminality, they are the ones who get the money. The pushers, the dealers and the people who import the drug. For them crime pays, at least financially. What about the people who grow the plants which the drugs are made of? They are mostly poor people growing the plants just like any other plants, like potatoes, and they get paid the same way.
Another group of criminals for whom crime does not pay financially are the perpetrators of violen acts: the rapists, murderers etc. They are not looking for it to pay. They commit their crimes just for the fun of it, maybe it is enough pay for them to see their victims suffering.
Then again, a group of criminals which make money are the white-collar criminals. these are people who usually work in high places, in offices, banks etc., and are well-paid. Even if they are well-paid they use their position to get more money, usually by swindle. Nowadays they often get very much help from computers.
I think the treshold for me me to commit a crime is quite high. First of all I would have to be sure of the fact that would not get caught, of course. Secondly there would absolutely have to be very much money in it for me. And I would have to be able to plan my criminal act quite carefully. I don't think that I could commit a crime just out of a whim.
In the world we live in today, crime is an ever-growing problem. It is dangerous to take a walk in a park after dark, or even in the daytime. You can't leave your belongings unattended evn for a moment. Putting your money in the bank can be dangerous. One is forced to always be alert. Maybe it is the likeliness for a crime to pay that makes crime so common.
I guess I have come to the conclusion that crime does not pay and it does pay. But mostly the ones for whom crime pays don't have to dirty their hands. And of course there is the psychological side of it all, I think that there is no criminal who does not feel guilt. The feeling can haunt the criminal for the rest of his/her life, in that sense crime never pays.

Even in this cold, industrialized, technological world of ours there must always be a place for dreaming and imagination in a human mind, because dreaming and imagination belong to the rare group of things that make life worth living for. People just have to give themselves time to rise above their everyday problems and let the little child, living inside every and each one of us, to breath freely again and fly into beautiful unknown worlds of imagination.
I myself desperately yearn to see the world through the eyes of a child, which are so innocent, vulnerable and so utterly beautiful. For a child everything around him is new and pure magic. There is no clear distinction between what's real and what's unreal. You can never know what waits for you around the corner, because everything is possible. You believe in fairy tales and Santa Claus and they are an important part of your life, but what happens to you when you grow up.
You see death, violence, diseases, senseless killing and disasters all around the world and you feel totally helpless when there is nothing you can do to stop all the madness that goes on in the world. The industrialized, competitive society pushes you almost over the edge, when requiering you to do more and more. Eventually you find out you just can't take the pressure anymore. You start to believe there is nothing good in the world, no magic. Slowly but firmly your dreams start to break into pieces and the extraordinary capability to imagine things starts to fade away. However, the truth is that you musn't allow you to do this to yourself, because without dreams and imagination there is no hope for the future. You have to fight against the technological society so that it won't make you one of those burn out cases. You have the right to be yourself and to keep your dreams, because with their help you can also see the wonderful things of life.
You can escape from the reality once in a while and hide yourself in the beautiful world of imagination. There are no limits in that world and that's why in your dreams you can do whatever you want. In my opinion this kind of escaping can actully be very therapeutic, because at least for a second the life is worth living for, full of magic and miracles. Even for a short time the sun is shining just for you, like it has done for many people, letting you fly where the flow of your wildest dreams is taking you. You can feel the power of magical creativity springing from you like it was spring time. Then maybe you can fight again in this competitive society and still smile, because nobody can take away what you've got inside of you, your internal special world, which gives you power to go on.
I dream of a world, where there is peace and freedom everywhere, a better world for the unborn babies, who come into this world with their wondering eyes filled with amazement, seeing all the beautiful and magical things that life can offer them. Dreaming and imagining things are integral parts of me and that's why taking away my dreams would actually mean killing me. There is a child in all of us, so why wouldn't we all take a journey with our wildest dreams and keep a good care of the child inside of us. You just have to remember that MIRACLES DO HAPPEN AND DREAMS SOMETIMES COME TRUE!

FIJY1013,2.5,3.0,,,,,"In his novel ""Animal Farm"" George Orwell wrote ""All men are equal but some are more equal than others"". How true is this today?","
Already in the early centuries some men were more equal than others. Ancient Romans had slaves, European countries have had colonies where native people were subjected to their power and in many countries women weren't able to participate in making decisions. These are only a few examples of how things were in the past - how about today?
I think in some ways there has been progress since those days. Or has there? It's scary, that it's been only 50 years since the persecution of Jews. Almost the same thing is happening now in the 1990's between the Muslims and Serbians in Europe. Not to mention the new Nazism that has spread in German and in some other countries. We so- called modern people keep on persecuting each other for one's conviction.
In many countries minority groups aren't equal with the majorities. For example when it comes to language the Lapps don't have the same rights as the Finns. Same goes to minority cultures; people can't always live by their traditions because the dominant culture is so powerful.
This concernes the Indian culture in America and many ""primitive"" cultures as well.
There aren't colonies any longer, but people in some countries are still treated almost like in the 19th century. Rich countries are taking advantage of the poor ones. Coffee, fruits and other products are imported from the poor countries with a low payment. People living and working there aren't paid as well as they should. This makes them unable to become economically equal with those better off.
You could say that wealthy people are more equal than those who aren't wealthy. Money makes the world go round!
With money you can get power and with power you can make almost anything happen. One instance out of many is the current situation in Russia: there are either very rich people or those who are very poor - and the Mafia lurks almost everywhere.
When you're good looking you often have good chances to do well in life. Peopl's attitudes may be more accepting towards you than towards a person, who's not so attractive. Also unabled people, for example those who are sick (handicapped, mentally retarded etc) are often treated inequally. People don't always take old people etc seriously, because they think these people don't have anything to give to us. Fortunately things aren't that way in every culture!
In some countries children are used as a cheap labour.
For instance in India and Nepal they start working when they are 5-7 years old. In some cultures 9-20-year-old girls are married to men they don't even know and they have to give birth even though their body is not ready for that yet.
Gender plays still a role when talking about equality.
In China parents wish for a son because he's a better staff and support to them in their old age than a daughter. There are cultures where women have no say whatsoever. Women get also usually less pay than men for the same job.
There is a lot of prejudice and discrimination in the world. Not all cultures can be the same kind, but men in all should be equal. Hopefully people wake up one day and inequality will be an unknown term in the society to become.

Almost every nation in the world has an army which is there to protect the people, and to keep up a warning sign, so to speak, to prevent any attemps of foreign or domestic invasion. Thus, it is nowadays practically impossible for a nation to exist independently without an army.
Whether a defence system should be professionnal or based on compulsory service is for each country to decide itself. There are nations with large population, good economy, beneficial geographic location and those that are politically well-positioned. And, there are those that are quite the opposite.
I doubt that there is anyone who seriously thinks that a national army has no value, what so ever. History shows many examples of national armies that have influenced positively on the matters of freedom, independence and on the way people perceive themselves and their country. A national service today is an excellent teacher of team work and such individual bahaviour that it can benefit the whole unit. However, there are some problems with motivation. The fact that every man - as is the case in Finland - has to go through a military training of some sort is quite incomprehensible, since most western countries are based on freedom of choice and individuality. Some are totally unfit for the army and may suffer mentally while doing their compulsory service. Fortunately, the military personel these days is very aware of the problems, and is equipped to offer help or even give exemptions.
A professional army is undoubtedly of good quality. The soldiers are selected among the best, which means that there is enough competent material to choose from. A soldier should commit to profession and improve his skills in it, as should one in any other line of work. But does a commitment last throughout one's whole career? Everybody has seen examples of corrupt policemen and doctors performing questionable operations. For these kinds of professions it is essential that one is ready to do more than just go to work and do what is told; he should be prepared to more of himself and be willing to finish the job, even if it means staying after hours. People's views and ideas change during life and similarely the motivation for work can change. It is natural to forget the great ideal that affected on the career choice in the first place. Putting on the uniform may become a must, the thing to do to get paid. But one has to keep in mind that soldiers are trained for wars and it is clear that if native land enters a war, there is no one who will think about money matters.
A military system is expensive for any country, and a pure professional army even more costly, although such armies have ways of financing the organization. A lot of money is involved in the business dealing with weapons and other military devices. In a case of national army the government is responsible for the expenses, which means taxes. These expenses include the ones mentioned above and the wages of the personel who could be classified as prossional soldiers, excuding other staff members like office clerks, cooks etc. Therefore, a national service system is a combination of professionals and amateurs. But as was said earlier the choice of army results from the country's needs and from what it can provide for its military.

FIJY1016,3.5,2.5,,,,,"Some people say that in our modern world, dominated by science and technology and industrialisation, there is no longer a place for dreaming and imagination. What is your opinion?","
During centuries and even millenniums the human beings have had dreams. They have always dreamt of all kinds of things. A man from the Stone Age dreamt of having new better tools and weapons in order to get some food. The explorers of the Renaissance dreamt of finding new continents, countries and civilisations. The scientists of this century have dreamt - and are still dreaming - of finding a cure for cancer and AIDS and many other fatal diseases. The first two of these three examples came true and hopefully the last finally will. The great desire of wanting something will make dreams come true.
Eras come and go and the dreams change. Many people have been very concerned about the domination of science technology and the growing industrialisation today and in the future. They think that in time we will become pathetic machinelike poor creatures. To be true, it is quite natural to think that way but if you reflect the matter carefully you will realise that all these concerns are unnecessary. Dreams will never disappear from our minds. We will never lose our imagination. That is impossible. Science technology and industrialisation can never take their place and they will not make us unemotional or unimaginative. On the contrary, they can be very useful because they can help us to fulfil our dreams: we do not have to just dream of our dreams come true but actually make them happen. With the help of the new technology you can actually put your dreams into effect the way that would not have been possible before.
One good example is the virtual reality. It gives you a great possibility to make even your wildest dreams come true: the virtual reality allows you to make a journey to Saturn if that is what you want. It would not be realistic to wait it happen in real life, not today, but possible through the simulators. Only the question is whether these experiences can replace the real thing or not, but as it is not possible to actually make a trip to Saturn this simulator has its content users. Technology and industrialisation give also other possibilities, for practical and social reasons for instance, to make these dreams come true: the scientists today are very likely able to find a cure for many fatal diseases. That would not be possible without new technology and knowledge.
Industrialism does not mean that dreams and imagination are in danger. For example the entertainment industry can give you experiences that would be impossible to carry out in real life. For example if you have always dreamt of being chased by a Tyrannosaurus Rex all you have to do is to go to the cinema. You can even see one more good point in growing industry: you can get much more time for yourself when the machines and robots do most of the work for you. The industrialism is not after all such a bad thing from this point of view.
Dreams and imagination are essential both for a human being and for the humankind. Dreams and imagination give a person a chance to feel personal satisfaction. As for the humankind, they serve as a mean to develop our civilisation and find some answers to our various problems. The desire to make dreams come true usually is so strong that we actually do everything to make it happen. Nothing can prevent us from dreaming; it is a vitally important characteristic of a human being. It sounds utopistic but it is true that without dreams and imagination we would be nothing. Maybe we would not even exist. We know, consciously or unconsciously, that our dreams and our imagination are actually the things that guide our lives.

The function of defensive forces of any kind is primarily to quarantee the safety of an independent state and to make its independence credible. From the grounds of this statement we should ponder on the question of how these military forces should be built up. From a realistic point of wiev the choice between a wage army and obligatory military service is often defined by the existing circumstances. When looking from idealistic wievpoint the criteria for making the choice may be different.
In question of my homeland, Finland, it has been said that the choice is clear. A nation of about five miljon people has no big difficulty in running an obligatory military service. Also, it has been stated that with any nation, especially a little one which is more coherent than a big one, an army based on obligatory military service has more motivation in battle situations than a wage army. When the wage army is doing its job for money, the others are deeply worried about their homes and families. I beg to differ. There are ways around that.
Many big nations are also running obligatory military services, although a wage army would present them with more simpler arrangeing and lower costs. Some countries have both forms of defence running simultaneously. A wage army is also very handy when entering a policy where out-of-country operations are required. The U.S.A have presented us with examples of that.
From my personal point of wiev a wage army is the best alternative. Since there are people who are interested in military why not give them money for acting according to their interests. Professionals would be better organised and far more competent than conscripts. A wage army would not have to be so big, especially in finland where the function of a defence system of any kind is quite nominal anyway. Even if the expenses would rise a little I would still go for the professionals on account of increasing competence. What comes to the better motivation of a conscript army, that does not apply anymore. Patriotism is on the decreace. Besides, a wage army consisting of Finnish people would have the same properties in that relation. This arrangement would also make the life of those not interested in military career much easier. It is no fun to lead your life with military service looming somewhere in the future. The older you get the harder it will became to spend a year in the army. It is a waist of time for most people.
So, if it is felt that our credibility as an independent state will suffer without an army of somekind, why not form a reasonably-sized wage army. Investing in military equiptments in a larger scale is not a wise thing to do for any country, because the others will always try to make even according to their possibilities. Forming relatively small wage armies would be the right direction. That way we might some day come to a situation where defensive- or any other kind of forces would not be considered inevitable.

FIJY1024,4.0,,,,,,"In his novel ""Animal Farm"" George Orwell wrote ""All men are equal but some are more equal than others"". How true is this today?","
Inequality still exists almost everywhere we go; mankind hasn't learned its lesson from slavery or from the Second World War. You onlu have to read an article dealing with racism in South Africa and you realise that yourself.
Even though there has lately been many improvement, racial discrimination is still one of the great issues of inequality. You could say that, on the whole, white people are more equal than black people. We all know that there's no natural justification for that, but even so, the world is full of example that show how black people and other minorities are treated as inferiors. One of the cruelest examples was the percecution of Jews during the Second World War. And today Nazism is raising its head again especially in Germany.
Discrimination on the basis of one's gender is another example of how full equality hasn't yet been accomplished. In China girlbabies are abandoned because parent and the whole society prefers boys to girls. Men have ruled society for thousands of years leaving women home with children. Of course, there are exeptions, communities where a woman is the head of a family, but those are only exeptions to the rule. Women's inequality compared to men is clearly visible when work and, in particular, wages are in question. Regrettably equal work doesn't mean equal pay to women.
Now that the depression has lowered the number of jobs available it is even harder than before to get a summer job - or any kind of jobs - unless you have relatives or in some other ways good relations to the people in power. Formerly it the children of the lower classes that had to work during the vacances. The children of the upper classes could go on a holiday without any worries about work or money. Nowadays it is the young people with good relations (usually that means a relative in the board of directors) who get the jobs and those from the lower classes are left without.
Money means power and most of the money is concentrated in the industrialised countries. So the third world is left with almost no power at all. The unequal concentration of money and power is inevitable but most of the money in the world shouldn't be concentrated on such a limited area; America, Europe, Japan and Australia. At least when millions of people are suffering of malnutrition and diseases that are conquered in the western world. Some have tried to correct this injustice with socialism. And the outcome was predictable. The idea of a person being just as equal as anybody else is so absurd it won't work in reality even if it looked well on the paper. Humans are too egocentric and so different in their ambitions that the idea of working hard and still getting the same salary as everyone else is not going to work. We've seen that happen in former Sovjet Union that's now crumbled down. People who got tired of being equal are now operating the many mafia groupings which they didn't have when under socialism.
We're lucky to live in Finland because even we women are here more equal to men than in most other countries. But also here  as George Orwell has said, and those tend to be the white men with money.

FIJY1026,2.5,3.0,2.5,3.0,2.0,2.5,Crime does not pay,"
Every single day crime can be seen around us. We can see it on television and in the newspapers. There are robberies, burglaries, assaults, murders. Crime is everywhere. In the small towns as well as in big cities. And the fact that anybody could be a victim, makes one feel very vulnerable.
Who are the criminals? What makes them so indifferent to other people and also to themselves?
A large number of criminals come from unstable backgrounds. Many have grown up in broken homes, witnessing substance abuse and other kind of damaging behaviour. This is certainly not their fault, it's their disadvantage.
While we know that youngsters who come from unstable backgrounds are more likely to become criminals than youngsters brought up in a so called good home, everything possible should be done to prevent it. A child has to know what is right and what is wrong. They might get fallacies about crime and violence watching TV programs that present violence as an easy solution to problems. The parents' responsibility is to explain their children that it is wrong to hurt somebody, it is wrong to commit a crime.
The children also should be taught, both at home and in school, that they have to take responsibility of their actions. If they do something bad, they have to answer for it. There is no easy way out. The best thing parents can do for a child is to show him that they love him and care about him.
Criminals get caught in some point or another. So the saying: ""Crime does not pay"" is really true. Even if a robber could steel a large sum of money and enjoy it for a while (if his conscience lets him really enjoy it, that is) sooner or later he will get caught. And it is not worth it. His future will be ruined.
If a criminal is imprisoned, his future looks pretty hopeless. When he gets out, he has to learn again many social skills to succeed. It will be very hard to find someone who would be willing to trust him enough to employ him, and he'll find that many doors are closed on him because of his criminal history.
There have been positive results about reconciliation, Which means that the criminal has to meet the victim personally and they together try to find a way how the crime could be compensated. This method makes the criminal see very clearly what he has done, makes him (hopefully) feel responsible for his actions, and decide not to do it again.
Especially for juvenile delinquents reconciliation is a possibility to try to improve their habits. They still have a future ahead of them and hopefully they see that there are so many opportunities in life that it would be a shame to waste them all by committing crimes.
All parents and educators and everybody who deal with young people should use their influence on the youth by telling them over and over again that crime does not pay.

 ... and ABBA was right, they literally hit the nail on the head. Money is important, money is power. Of course there are some other things that are even more important, such as love or a true friendship, but I am sure everybody agrees that money definitely belongs to the most valuable things in peoples' lives. It is true, yes, money can cause also negative effects, for example greediness or jealousy but its' positive effects are much more powerful. Money talks, money is the key that fits in every door. When you have money you can do what ever you have dreamed about. You do not have to count every penny any longer, thinking whether you can or cannot afford your plans. Money gives you a possibility of a fuller and more secure life. In my opinion, money is not by any means the root of all evil - oh no, it is quite the opposite.
When I still lived at home with my parents I never had any bigger problems with money. Food and living did not cost me anything, there were no bills for me to pay and I even got a little pocket money. It never ocurred to me how expensive it was to take care of only those most essential parts of living. I never realized that someday I am alone and counting every penny in order to survive. For four years now I have been on my own. At the age of 19 I left home and moved in together with my boyfriend. We are both students and the financial situation is not very good. But we will survive; thanks to our parents who are kind people and concerned about us. They give us some extra money every now and then when we have it tough. They are a great help to us and I wish that someday we could pay them back for what they have done to us. Even though we, my boyfriend and I, are already of age, they still want to help us. That is something one cannot forget.
We have tried everything so that we would not need to ask money from our parents - it is really embarrassing to beg for alms all the time. We have played Lotto and bought even some lottery tickets (how desperate!) but we have not ever, not even once, won anything... Perhaps we just were not born under a lucky star. We do not work because there are no jobs available, the taxes are too high and there is no time because of the studies. Sometimes I have caught myself dreaming about someday being rich, wondering what I could do if I had so much money I could do whatever I wanted. Well, I would buy beautiful clothes, a nice house with pane windows and three collie-dogs, one of each colour... I would travel in various countries and enjoy life. Is that too much asked? I would love a life without constant worries about money and especially the lack of it. When I finally wake up from my dreams I suddenly realize that that ""someday"" of my dreams is not here yet. Today is today and I am still a poor student.
But I will go on living and trusting in the future. I will study hard and finally somehow deserve my well-being. To be a student is not easy for anybody in today's Finland. Financial aid given for the students is not much and it is horrible to take a loan in these days. The future is unsecure and frightening because the unemployment rates have been raising all the way through under the past few years. But we cannot give up - I am definitely not going to give up. Instead I am going to get myself a proper profession and to get along... maybe even be rich! These years of counting pennies have given me strenght and willpower to fight for certain goals and to prove myself that hard work and strong will, if nothing else, can make my life better and bring well-being and riches - and of course a possibility to have my three beautiful collie-dogs...

Crime is on the increase. The moral values have loosened and the importance of the family and relatives diminished. Drug-related problems are increasing which results in criminal acts being committed to acquire money to buy drugs. Crime and drug-abuse are also going up due to the Russians floating in the country. The depression in its part adds to this problem as people have no sense of security. There are a great number of people unemployed and short of money. This often results in loosing one's hope. Teenagers also feel they have no future ahead of them. They find it hard to believe that they ever will have jobs to go to.
Thought crime may seem as one solution to poverty and frustration, an easy way out so to speak, it is really one of the worst. Turning to crime is only a beginning of a huge set of problems tight together. A criminal destroys his own life and, unfortunately, often other peoples' lives as well. He has no future to wait for. Sooner or later he will get a criminal record after which employees do not willingly employ him. A person with a criminal record will not either be accepted to certain lines of education. For instance, police academy is straight out of the question. In addition, he is not allowed to work abroad. Person turning to crime gets a bad repution as well. People in general start to look at him differently. They feel ashamed of him and, probably, a little bit of afraid too. In the end they do not want to have anything to do with him.
A criminal can never know when the police is at the door. He may be arrested at any time or in any place, the property he has acquired by crime taken away and he himself thrown to jail. If he shares any details to do with his criminal activities with an other person, he also risks getting caught, because the person in question could any day expose him, go and tell it all to the police. On the other hand, if he chooses not to tell anybody, he will have to accept the fact that he will live a lonely life. In addition, he may never be openly proud of what he has accomplished because simultaneously he would admit to having committed a crime. Should he ever need police protection himself, he would have to think twice before asking for it, because his dirty secrets might be revealed at the same time.
If the police knew he had committed a crime and were looking for him, he would have to lead his life undercover for an indefinite period of time. A life where he is totally cut from the outside world. He could not meet his friends and family or lead a normal life in any way. Should there be a medical problem he could not go and see the doctor. Someone-else would have to do his shopping etc. As a result, he would be very depended on this person. He would have no choice but to trust this person completely.
Crime has also consequences affecting the society. Because of crime taxes are higher. After all, broken property has to be fixed which requires government money and when government runs short of money, it is forced to raise taxes, which we the citizens have to pay from our pockets. Jails are also institutes kept by the government, the same applies to the police-force. Once again these are, surprise, surprise, covered by the taxes. Increasing crime results to added security and more protection which of course calls for money. Furthermore, to quarantee safety and order in the society there will have to be new restrictions, new stricter rules and laws. Naturally, this restricts the freedom of an indivudual. The society is turning to a ""policestate""!
There are also ideological aspects to be considered. The Bible for one condemns crime. Moral ethnics condemns crime as well. If we believe to be on this earth to learn and to grow as individuals then crime is a violation against human rights and everything that humanity stands for. Crime fights human dignity. I personally believe that the purpose of human life is to develop as an individual and add to the good in life. I want to do my share to increase the well-being of mankind by choosing to do what is right for me as well as for the humankind. I want to live my life so that I later can look back proudly and with no regrets, no feelings of guilt.

Thousands of years ago there was an ancient man who needed something he could not get or gain alone. So he went searching, searching for another man who could possibly have that something. When he finally found him, it appeared that this particular man missed something, too, something that the first man had more than he needed. That was an evident bargain. They changed, they bartered, and both could now have all the things they needed to survive.
That is how bartering possibly may have begun. Somewhere, someone had got something; and somewhere else, a few miles away, someone else had got something else. ""You take a sackful of this if I can have a sackful of that."" And the both agreed. The first problem those ancient men probably faced was: ""What about if what I have and the other fellow needs is scantier and more valuable, far rarer than the stuff the other fellow has and I need? I should definitely have more, maybe double the amount than the other fellow. I take two sackfuls of your thing, you will only get one sackful of mine.""
Sometimes it was easy and fair. Both agreed and were happy. But sooner or later they faced difficulties. They must have disagreed on the bartering conditions at some point. And then they had to invent a tool, a means of trading. First the means might have been skins of animals, then valuable metals like gold, then special pieces of gold which later developed to round coins, then paper with different symbols indicating its value and, finally, data signals controlled by plastic cards and computer systems.
Definitely the development of trading means has made trading a great deal easier. But what else has the introduction of money brought with it? From the very beginning, when it was determined and commonly adopted that silver and gold would be of value and a measure of richness, there have been people who have gathered them and become devoted to gathering them. And then the ever-growing passion for wealth spread along with the growing civilization and began to touch every corner of the world. And no good can be expected when money becomes a drug, an obsession, where always more and more has to be gained. Life becomes easier, but only materially easier when one has got a lot of money. One does not have to care about his subsistence or survival. Who would not like to lead an easy life without serious material concern?
And man, in his greed, was very cunning, too. He created a ruling and controlling system; he created a pecking order where the richest men control those who are not as rich while they together master ""average folk"" who, joining the richer ones, control together poor people who still have the opportunity to trample on even poorer people - the poorest of all. Those who are rich have got the power to master and make decisions and, after all, they get more wealth. More wealth brings more power, more power brings even more wealth, and so on. The continuing vicious circle (vicious to the poor and the idealists only) is ready. The table is set, the money meal is served for the rich. The oppression may begin.
This principle of the connection between money and power has been applied successfully many times during the history of mankind. A good example is the colonialism of European countries in the last centuries. Already more civilized, industrialized and technically developed Europeans who had moderately high standard of living, had got the power and could easily conquer land in Africa and South America. There people used to lead a simple life and could not resist. Soon were the whole two continents divided between conquerers. The result was that the rich got more and the poor were left with even less that they used to have.
This story can be told again and again and it happens all the time in different disguises. Greed for money has been the source of many bad acts and the reason for many sad things that have happened. But so have power, might, war, organized religion and many other kinds of addictions as well. And none of them shows itself alone : all are connected in a way. And every coin has the other side, too.

We living in the western world seem to take equality for granted. To us it is self evident that all men (and women) are equal and should be treated that way. But it is not that simple, not in the world in its entirety and not even in our own society.
We may think that unequality is just a problem of some undeveloped countries, and that it doesn't concern us. Much has been done to make the differences between people smaller, and to guarantee the same basic rights to everybody. In western countries equality is now closer than ever, and we have come a long way compared to the society one or two hundred years ago. And women are nowhere as free as they are in Europe and in the United States - women are not property of men and basically they have the same rights and possibilities as men do. But the fact is, that in real life men and women are not treated as equal. For exemple, women's salaries are lower than men's, and most of the high leading positions are held by men. The main responsibility of the household and children is still on the mother, even when both of the parents are working. Of course the situation has changed, and men are now more willing to share the tasks and duties at home; a Swedish research shows that when a baby is born to a family, also the man's contribution to housework increases - 16 minutes a week. It is true, that women's position has improved significantly, and that complete equality between genders is never possible - nature has created us different - but something can still be done. Women and men are equal, when they have the same rights, the same obligations and the same possibilities - at home, when studying, at work.
A special problematic area for the question of equality and unequality is the third world. People living in undeveloped or developing countries don't have the same possibilities of life, and thus are in a very unequal position compared to us living in the ""wealthy west"". Many of the children born in Africa or Asia don't even have a chance to live and grow: infant mortality is very high in many of the developing countries. Also education is a priviledge for those, who can afford it, and usually only boys are sent to school. One reason for the poverty of the third world is extremely high birth rate. Statistics have shown that by educating women it is possible to lower the high birth rate, and this way not only help the progress of equalization between genders, but also help a whole country.
The gap between the industrialized countries and the third world is still great, although it has been narrowing in the last few decades. No more are the ""civilized"" countries of Europe practicing their imperialism, but aiding and building the countries they used to exploit. There are projects such as drilling and digging wells, arranging councelling and health care, and educating people. But still the major problem has been left alone. Developing countries produce in the main only raw materials or half-products, which are taken abroad to be refined. It is not in the western world's own best interest to develop industry and economic life of the third world, because importing cheap materials for further manufacturing is a benefit western industry doesn't want to give up. But to really help developing countries, we should forget our own interests and concentrate on their real problems. Taking that step would be a step forward a more equal mankind.

To the question whether there is a place for dreaming and imagination in the modern world or not, in my opinion, there is not just a simple answer yes or no. Some people say that there is no time for those things and some even think that they are quite unnecessary. However there are also people, like myself, who think that they are very important and that there will always be time for them.
Industrialisation and science technology have brought machines, schedules and a change in the nature of work with them. When machines directed by computers do much of the physical work, humans are left with the brain work which can be at least as hard as the physical work. At the times when our grandparents made their work with the hands their minds were free to wander where ever they chose to. Today the brain work requires all of our psychic attention: if we loose it at an important moment awful things can happen. We cannot afford any mistakes.
Science technology has also shaped a new world picture. People don't believe in God or eny miracles any more. Spiritualism is out of date. Science is the God today and it is based on reason. We have to test and prove everything rationally. Dreaming and imagination are something irrational. We have gone so far that we don't even trust our own senses any more but we do everything by the books.
Working and hurrying from place to place has become for many people the way of life. There seems to be no time for family, friends and hobbies. Some people are so stressed that they can't even dream in the night because they can't sleep, not to mention daydreaming. But does it have to be like that? I don't think so.
It may be true that for some people there is no time enough for dreaming but that's because they have wrong priorities. They put superficial values before spiritual values. However I do just the opposite. Of course I feel responsible of my studies but I also need to relax from time to time, and dreaming is one way to do so. In case I don't seem to have time for dreaming I just take it. Dreaming helps me to go on, otherwise I can't.
I can just sit and dream for hours and hours. I often do so. I'm not afraid of being alone because I always have my dreams to accompany me. That is why I seldom feel really lonely. Whenever I'm bored and I have nothing to do I dream. Sometimes when I'm stressed and I have too much to do I dream. I often feel guilty for ""doing nothing"" when I should be doing school work, dishes or something else unpleasant. Some people can be so unbelievably effective that they can do everything and even more, but I'm not like that. I need dreaming. It is something necessary to living. There is a totally different world inside my head, usually much happier and more beautiful than the real world.
I've noticed that I've become rather overpowered by my senses too but I definitely won't let them rule my whole life. Without dreaming and imagination life would be boring, monotonous and not worth living for. They make life richer and more colourful. Imagination might be a forgotten skill for many people today but they should try to find it again inside themselves. Even if it may not be easy it is finally only a question of putting things in the order of importance.

Constitutions and declarations say all men are equal. I agree. We are equal at the very moment of our birth, but from then on the absolute human value is cast aside and our rating proceeds on other grounds.
It has been said that since the demolition of the class division societies have become more egalitarian. Yet some features of that division are still around accompanied by a number of other forms or injustice, ones that in the days of ""good, old"" class division weren't even considered to be unrighteous. One of these old features, still persistently around, is money - perhaps the best trump one can have. It gives you almost unlimited access to where ever it is you want to go to. Ironically enough, money has succeeded in what the humanity is striving for: nowadays all money is equal regardless of its origin, whether inherited or earned, whereas the origin of a person remains to be either an asset or an obstacle.
During the last three decades the issues of equality and human rights have gained more publicity as more and more people have come to realize that the present situation is unbearable. for how long can a small majority of the worlds population use some 75% of all its resources? It has been predicted that in the long run this will lead to another Great Migration, compared to which the recent stream of emigrants and refugees is a drop in the ocean, when those whose share has never been given to them , start searching for it.
Inequality is not merely a problem in the relations between the the rich Western countries and the poor, less developed countries. In practice, there is no country that would provide all its citizens with equal rights and services. In fact, some countries are still mistreating their national minorities even to the extend of depriving them their right to use their own language. Even if the long-standing supremacy of the white minority in South-Africa has come to an end, we shouldn't just lie back and sigh with content.
Has there been any positive development, it has been in the fields of sexual equality, although this again is true only with the Western countries. Women have paid jobs (though too often less paid than those of men's), they enter careers and participate in politics. This is a natural result of the fact that in some countries there are more women in universities than men. As soon as men start to give birth to babies or stop asking women to choose between a family and a career, we're almost there.
Those who say there is enough equality in our world as it is are those who most profit from the lack of it. Pessimistically thought the whole idea of perfect equality is utopian, since attaining that would mean stripping people of their history and religion in order to achieve for example sexual equality in some parts of the world. If we settle for less than perfection a lot can be done by education and change of priorities. If not, there will always be those who are much more equal than others.

The gap between the rich and the poor has throughout the history of human race been the main cause for one man feeling himself superior to the other. We have invented several ways of measuring human dignity and without reasonable justification we have tortured, neglected and despised our fellow citizens. The less worthy people watch from a distance as the superiors consume until the Mother Earth chokes on the waste and litter.
The idea of equality is constantly being ruined on the grounds of numerous factors; religion, race, nationality, language, social class, sex, wealth etc. These factors will keep causing conflicts among homo sapiens-tribe, which has been the case since we climbed down the tree.
Thousands of years ago the needs of emperors in ancient Rome were fulfilled by slaves; the Arabic sheiks had and have their harems; the Egyptian pyramids were all built with human labour. The Americans brought the black slaves to their continent and even nowadays we can find separate public toilets for ""blacks"" and ""whites"" in some peripheral areas of the country.
Religion has started and also justified most of the wars fought by man. Most religions have articles of faith that encourage to convert the ""heretics"" into their true, genuine religion, whatever that might be. The Indian caste system still effects in the everyday life among ordinary people, even if it is officially abolished. The position of women in most religions, for example in Islam or Hinduism, seems sometimes unbelievable to liberated and modern woman living in the western world. In India widows used to end up burned to death with their already dead husbands' bodies.
The sexual revolution has started only during this century. In some countries of the western world of the 1700's-1800's women did not even have any legal rights; they had no right to possess property or estate and their life was very much controlled by their fathers or husbands. Women have gained the right to vote and there are many female executives or politicians. Nevertheless, some women still have lower wages than the men have for the same job. In the working society sexual harassment has became a public subject of conversation, because women no longer tolerate the losing of a job because of not wanting to show some ""special"" attention to their male bosses.
The racial, religious and cultural differences are about to have a major effect on many parts of Europe, because the amount of refugees is growing constantly. The nations mix with each other, at least to some extent, and people face many nationalities even in the streets of their hometown. If the current wars still go on for years, there will be more refugees from those areas and possibly new ones from some wars still ahead of us.
It is a long way to a peaceful co-existence among all the races and cultures and those other factors mentioned. The learning of man has been slow and it appears to remain that way, and in the convenient, comfortable standard of living, which some of the people on Earth have achieved, it is easy to give in to selfishness. It is hard to think of giving up some of ones lifes conveniences and starting to share these things with all of the world.

FIJY1042,3.5,3.0,,,,,Crime does not pay,"
When I was a little girl, I was told about good people and bad people. Polices were the good ones and robbers the bad ones. The first books I read were detective novels, where a brilliant man made clever conclusions and always caught the criminal. And the whole story ended happily.
Nowadays I'm not so sure about these ""happy ends"" anymore. All you have to do is to scan the newspaper and you find dozens of stories about murders, burglaries, missing persons. Many of these cases will never be solved. For example, a young woman was murdered here in Finland about 15-20 years ago. The state police doesn't have a clue about the killer. Another young girl was found in a river a couple of years ago. She had been hitchhiking on a Saturday evening and never got back home. The police is still investigating the crime. In Sweden, their prime minister was shot in the middle of Stocholm. This happened about ten years ago. And in USA, somebody assassinated the president in 1960's. No one has been able to solve these murders.
In the 1930's there was this huge recession in the world. There was also well-organized black market, especially in USA at that time. We've all heard about Al Capone, the famous gangster. He was the one who made a fortune selling alcohol during the prohibitory law. Capone was also known from his connections to mafia, but the only crimes the police could blame him were minor offences.
Since the 1970's drugs have become a huge industry in every part of the world. Altough the authorities have made enormous confiscations during the last few years, none of the major drugdealers have been caught. It makes me wonder, how it's possible for f.ex. mafia to continually cheat the police, who has been well-trained for also this kind of situations, without getting caught.
Recently also tax evasion have increased remarkably. It used to be done only in companies which were in trouble, but nowadays also ordinary people try to avoid taxes. The recession is in some extent guilty to this. Unemployment isn't unusual anymore, but it's difficult to change the way we spent money in the good old days, so it's no wonder that suddenly we find ourselves in deep trouble. Some people think that criminalities will help them to survive to the better tomorrow. Some will succeed, some won't.
I must admit that I've only handled this subject from the negative point of view. I'm not this pessimistic all the time, but still, it's so huge number of people who have done something illegal and succeeded. I hope that this world will turn better soon so that my own children can have a slightly more positive attitude towards their society.

FIJY1043,3.0,2.0,,,,,Feminists have done more harm to the cause of women than good,"
When people think about feminism, they usually consider it as an ideology based on the thought about the cause of women. But what exactly does the term cause of women mean? Is it the principle of ordinary women striving for the equality of the sexes or that of ardent feminists who would like to dominate the whole world and men? It is definitely not easy to answer this question, because there are various opinious about what the cause of women really is. It seems that also the word feminism has many meanings in our society. The original meaning probably is the one that defines feminism as an activity aiming at equal rights and chances for men and women. However, the complexity of those two concepts often leads to misunderstandings.
On second thoughts, it is true that when you hear or see the word feminism, you immediately know that it has something to do with the female sex. This is a simple fact known to everybody, but has anyone ever wondered why this movement striving for equality has a name that totally excludes the opposite sex? A man can't be a feminist. The movement is not called the equality movement but the feminist movement, for women only. Thus, the name divides people into male and female. That is why it is often thought that the whole ideology is against men, which means that it can't be for equality. Feminists are regarded as women having a dislike of men, which on no account is a good thing for their reputation.
It must be admitted that there is a natural division into men and women that we just have to accept. This physiological and, above all, psychological difference is purely positive - without it the relationships between men and women would be pretty boring... Our bodies are different, we think in slightly different ways, etc. Unfortunately, the fact that this difference exists has always made one of the sexes think that it is entitled to oppress and dominate the opposite one. In the history of the world men have usually been the dominators, for the simple reason that they are stronger. Though there are some primitive cultures led by women, they are only exceptions to the rule. Nowadays, the situation is changing. The change started in the 1960's and it has been a fast one. At that time, there was a sexual revolution going on in the western society. People no longer appreciated the old, conservative values that were full of references to religion. All that made it easier for the feminist movement to find support especially among young women. In a way, the emphasis was on sexuality, which affected the so-called feminist issues. Abortion became the hot issue. This changed the reputation of feminists. Earlier there had been demands for the right to vote, which had been attained. Women became militant and war broke out between the sexes. Feminists called each other sisters and some groups of women even lived together. Such intimacy made people consider them all as lesbians. Furthermore, those women started acting like men - burning their bras was a symbol of this change in their lifestyle. These were not the most brilliant feminist ideas, but they still influence the way people think. The characteristics of a feminist date back to 1960's: she is considered as an angry old maid who looks like a man.
Today, many women refuse to say they are feminists, because people have such negative attitudes towards them. Contrary to what might be thought, lots of women start to abandon this movement that should support women's rights. And yet they want equal pay, a right to education and work just like feminists. At the same time, the ""real"" feminists start to accuse those women of being stupid victims of men. There has to be something wrong with the whole movement. It has achieved lots of important goals that make women's situation better, but it also has had some harmful effects on the cause of women. The barrier between the sexes is still getting stronger even though people struggle for equality. Who is to blame? Men? Feminists? Non-feminists? Probably all of them. So why not try and solve our problems together without thinking so much about feminism, chauvinism or any other ideologies? It may be difficult, but it certainly is worth trying.

FIJY1044,2.5,2.0,,,,,Crime does not pay,"
It is claimed that crime does not pay.Of course, there are people who think this phrase is true and there are other people who don't agree with it. It is not easy to give a proper definition what crime really means. I think most people consider it to be an action to hurt somebody for example murder or rape or crime against someone's property. Various institutes like the church, political parties and government have their own ideas what is legal and what is criminal. But individual person is the first and the last to consider what is criminal to him or her with the help of their consciences.
Reading newspapers and watching TV has made me notice how awfully many murders and other crimes have been comitted. The statistics show that crime rate is getting higer all the time. This simply means that there have to be more people who do not care about rules. The interviews of mafia leaders and other criminals also show that they are doing very well with their dirty business. They are millionaires with all the luxury in their lives they can wish. There is only one ""little"" thing which casts its shadow over them - the police, that is why they have to live runaway's lives all the time. However money attracts people regardless of the police forces and the fear of being caught. It is obvious that these people think that crime does pay indeed.
Society has reacted very strongly to get rid of both the criminals and criminality. Life sentence and death penalty are the most severe examples. There are still a lot of people who value honesty, modesty and good manners when interacting with other member of the society. Criminals do not fit the pattern so they have to be ""removed"". On a practical level this means discrimination in every possible way.
Considering all this, criminal way of life seems to be very hard and extremely depressing. Even if the money which is gained through illegal ways brings power and wealth it will not necessarily give you all the most essential ""ingrediences"" of life like love, friedship social acceptance and respect from other people.
On my opinion there will never be a situation when I find crime to be a part of my life. Iam definetily against the idea that crime pays. But as Jesus said it is criminal to even have bad thoughts against your neighbour. In this aspect we all must admit we have beeen criminals in one sense.
Values and upbringing of a child as well as parents' and society's attitudes towards criminality will guide the in future to choose the bad or the good.
But in the end it is entirely up to you to listen to the voice of your conscious and make your decisions. Iam glad to say Ihave never had any doubts what I would do if I had to choose. It is a clear ""no"" to anything criminal.

""Money is the root of all evil"" is an old saying, as well as ""money does not make you happy"". To some extent both of these arguments are true. Most people have always wished to be rich or are longing to have more money. Nobody seems to be happy with what they have already got.
Every week millions of people all over the world spend enormous amounts of money on betting, gambling, lotteries, Lotto and other games of chanche wishing to win a lot of money. But in fact more people have lost money on gambling than anyone has ever won.
This is one way of getting some excitement to your life. Many people enjoy thinking of what they would do, if they won. There is always the possibility to win, someone will sooner or later. It is quite all right to spend some money on Lotto and other games as far as it is not away from other more important needs.
There are many sad stories about gamblers, who have lost all their properties, when they have not been able to stop gambling in time. They have been overwhelmed by the urge to win. Gambling can turn into a sickness, which is difficult to be cured of. There are old pensioners who spend all their money on pinball and slot machines. There machines are thougt to be quite harmless but people can also get hooked to these.
To some people money and property have become so important that they are the main purposes in their lives. To use money and to enjoy the possibilities money could give are of no importance to them. They are like Uncle Scrooge, they just worry about their fortune and spend their time trying to get richer and richer. Rich people can also be really stingy. It gives them satisfaction if they manage to buy something cheep. On the other hand it can make them almost sick if they have to give out money.
Greed and jealousy have caused a lot of unhappiness. It is difficult to share your money or property with other people. Family members have turned to be enemies or have broken all contacts with each other because of quarrels about the inheritance.
There are also stories about Lotto winners whose lives have been distroyed because they have not been able to live a normal life after having got rich.
It is sure that richness or money alone do not bring happiness, but living in poverty does not make people better either. The fact that you have money makes your life easier. There will be many more opportunities in life if you have money. You are more free to make your own decissions. You will be able to educate your children, you can choose where to live and you have better possibilities to plan how to use your time.
Money does not have to be the root of all evil, it can give you your freedom and make your life easier. You just have to decide what you want to do and not let the money rule over you.

FIJY1050,3.5,2.5,,,,,Most university degrees are theoretical and do not prepare students for the real world. They are therefore of very little value,"


Newspaper advertisements like these one can read almost in every newspaper or magazine. Why people with university degrees seek for job through newsadvertisements? There can be, of course many kinds of answers ranging from the point of view that university degrees are out of date to a conclusion that degrees are too theoretical not preparing students for the real life. One believes or has own experiences that degree does not answer the vocational demands.
When one thinks about the validity of the university degrees, one has to take into account many different needs: those of the society, science itself, post-graduate system, internationalization or to some extent student's own expectations. Today money plays the most important role in the field of (higher) education. It influences straight to the content of studies and the mode of courses. State funds had been greatly cut down in recent years and one sees no brighter future ahead. Cutting down the funds affect also on an ordinary student's daily studying life or style. The longitudity of studying has been limited to five years, the size of the groups is bigger, a lot of handouts to be read home(instead of workshops and interactive teaching - this does not mean that students are afraid of hard work). Savings jeopardize academic values and results.
It is clear that rapid changes in society, for example technological development, changes in working environment and greater need for international interaction demand a new way of thinking. One often hears many students to say: ""Where an earth do I need this in real life?"", ""I do not know what to do with this course - it is pure theory."" or ""Oh, I am not going to enroll in this course. I think I do not understand a single word of it."" Sometimes after a summer holiday one can hear students talking about their summer jobs. ""I worked in this trading company, there were no use for my studies."" or ""Why do I study, becuse my studies did not help me at all in work!"" It might seem that student's, university's and society's needs never meet each other. As one knows students are different kinds of people with different kinds of demands and everybody's demands can not be directly satisfied, although education is more and more based on individual choices despite of the savings.
One often forgets that everyday life's phenomena are mostly based on theories which come to life only with the touch of reality. According to my own experiences I do not agreee with the title that university degrees are too theoretical. All right, I have to admit that sometimes during my early university years I thought what an earth do I need this course for? But first stroke came when I was studying and working abroad. In everyday situations I noticed that I needed also theoretical knowledge. The more I learned, the more I needed theories to explain problems and give a solid foundation to things. And the most important thing which I realized was that the more I knew the more I was expected to know. Anyway theory/ies helped me to understand many language problems in practice and vise verca , in practical situations theory came to life and more understandable. Theories help to predict future and better to understand rapid changes. And therefore in my opinion university degrees are not too theoretical. I think that today's university degrees give a background and a fundament. And with the help of the degree everybody somehow manages in different working situations. Everybody has a possibility to deepen one's knowledge by oneself or apply, for example for post-graduate studies. Holly Carter has said somehow like this: ""The two things parents have to give for their children are roots and wings."" I think this holds true also for university studies.

FIJY1053,3.0,2.0,,,,,All armies should consist entirely of professional soldiers: there is no value in a system of military service,"
A huge responsibility is laid on the shoulders of almost teenaged boys, in some countries even younger ones. During their obligatory military service they hear dozens of times how they are going in weeks or months to became the ones who are ready to defend the country. You can't call them boys anymore but they are certainly not men yet either. In that point of view the army has one important function. To make men out of young boys. But that's only one aspect; otherwise I think there are several things that should be changed.
I can very easily imagine some young macho men - those who have enjoyed their time in military service, those who can't stand civil alternative service saying that all men choosing civil alternative service are namby-pambies - object to my opinions very strongly. What do I know about anything? I haven't been there myself. I haven't walked 40 miles with a full combat equipment, slept in large, freezing tents in an extreme cold. I have no excuse. I haven't had the change to try and propably when that change comes I'll be too old. I must admit though that I am not sure if I would ever make it. So my opinions are always without good proofs. But I strongly feel that joing to the army should be every males own personal decision. You should have the change to choose; isn't that one of your basic rights. But still there are countries and cultures that put you in the jail if you refuse to enter military service or even civil alternative service. Where is then your right to choose? There will always be boys who would at least want to think twice about joining to army. Boys with different kinds of reasons. As well as there will always be boys puffing out their chests with pride, who want to prove their manliness. And the society will call some ""real men"", while the others are ""conchies"". It takes long time before this kind of thinking is gone, it's so deep in the culture. The weak and the strong, the short and the tall, the slim and the fat. Maybe we all are equal in the front of God, but in the front of a captain or some other army commander we are not. The weak have problems with daily duties, they may perhaps have to deal with psychical problems, they can't run fast enough or shout loud enough. They are trying to do their best but at the same time they are told that it is not good enough. It really makes you think what is the meaning of all this. To separate people? How in this kind of atmosphere can a strong spirit of solidarity be born? Doesn't the whole system loose it's meaning when there are only some who take it really seriously. To create a united front the best thing to do is propably to change the system so that the ones who think that they have what it takes could make it their life career and dedicate to it. When everybody is working hard, giving everything to a common goal, the result is always good. Maybe this would be some kind of separating too, but at least it would be based on everybody's own decision. And that kind of national service that many countries have today is very expensive to maintain. Of cource it would cost great amounts of money to pay to professional soldiers, but I think it would still be cheaper to the society.
Always when talking about the army there is always a question of whether we need armies at all. Naturally every human being thinks that why there must be war when all it brings with is pain and sorrow. It's propably a too difficult question to be answered. Just now, even in this very moment, there are thousands, even millions people dying because of some stupid war. It is quite easy to think about it here when you are safe and there is no fear of a war. But if you start thinking it and imagine that there would break out war, it really doesn't need machine guns and bulletproof jackets. Tanks and bombproof shelters would all have been a waste of money. It doesn't need anything else than a couple nuclear weapon attacks and the whole earth is gone. And I can't understand why those heads of states don't think about that. Or why they refuse to think about it.

FIJY1055,3.5,4.0,,,,,"In the words of the old song: ""Money is the root of all evil""","
Money is definitely the root of all evil. I believe that at least 96 % of all the people in the world are not satisfied with the amount of money that they possess. And because earning more money by honest work is too slow and the amount of money you get that way is too small, more and more people resort to dishonest action. But this is only one half of the story, for not only does the yearning for more money cause much physical harm, it also brings along great emotional pain.
Perhaps the most harmful thing about money is the fact that you can never have it enough. No matter how rich you already are, you will always want more, always. You can never just relax and enjoy your money. How sad and torturing it is to live your whole life always trying to reach the state where you no more have to worry about money, but never reaching it.
If you happen to be rich, you probably have one worry more than the poor ones; in the matter of friendship. How can you tell, who is your real friend and who is just some greedy slimeball after your money. As those slimeballs are usually excellent ""actors"", the only way to reveal their true colours would be to loose all your money. But because that is out of the question, you are stuck with uncertainty. So there is no one around you, who you could, without any doubt, trust.
The lust for money may in some cases also lead to passion for gambling. Las Vegas is the well-known paradise for gamblers all over the world. Many people have lost fortunes there, by the roulette tables. Some people even become addicted to gambling. They simply cannot stop gambling, even though they are up to their ears in debt because of it.
What about the drug business then. The drug lords have realized that you can get huge, gigantic profit in the drug business. And when the stakes are this high, all actions, including brutal murders, are ""justified"". The most horrible thing is that even some small kids are involved in this business. They are the best possible drug dealers, because no one usually suspects them, and because they cannot be arrested and imprisoned in case they get caught.
Too much money is definitely a bad thing especially for the young. They will never learn to work hard for something they want, if they can always get everything they want with money. For you can even ""buy"" someone to do your homework and your tests with enough money. This in turn can lead the young one to assume that everything is for sale, even friendship and love.
In some countries, even some policemen and judges are corrupted. With a few, carefully selected bribes, you can buy yourself out of trouble. So, money can even get in the way of justice.
The power of money scares me. I do not want it to get a hold of me. That is why I have decided to aim for managing with as small amount of money as possible.

If I didn't dream of anything, I wouldn't be writing this essay.
Since I do dream of graduating from university one day, I have a strong motive for gaining all the study weeks required, and writing every essay included in the course-requirements. Why do I bother to study for several years? Simply because I want to receive a good education and a good job. Why do I dream of a good job? Because it will bring me money that will enable me to travel and do all the things I've dreamt of.
So it's mainly dreams that keep me going day after day.
I have lots of different kinds of dreams. Those which are likely to become true and those which are not very likely. Nevertheless, all the dreams are useful, since they are an evidence of my existence.
Dreams are also a way of escaping from the reality. Dreams and imagination are a cheap drug that is available to all of us - and quite harmless drug too. Normally there's no hangover after dreaming. That is, of course, if you dream fairly descent dreams.
Some of my dreams seem to aim for material well-being. There are, however, at least as many dreams that aim for mental well-being.
In my opinion, dreams in the modern society are the source of mental power, just as for an individual. Technology constantly needs imaginative and creative people who turn dreams into new products and thus into money. Development would stop and get stuck at the level it is now if people working for technology and science wouldn't dream. Just the same would happen to a person without dreams. He or she wouldn't want anything new, and wouldn't have the energy to try anything new that would complete and satisfy him or her as a person.
There are people who might think that development needn't go any further, since we have excellent technological equipment, and therefore suggest that dreams are useless in that sense. I think, however, that there are also other kinds of products of imagination that act as a counterbalance to technology and modern, busy way of life.
By ""other products"" I mean art. Books, films, music and novels, that help us to understand the present and the human nature. It might also act as a cheap drug and the easy way of getting out of the reality for a while. Art is also a source of the mental power, which might stimulate the readers, listeners etc. to produce their own ideas and dreams. Perhaps, one day to make their own book out of dreams, and support themselves by producing more and more art. So they will earn money, pay taxes, and therefore they will be a buttress of society. So only one dream might be a start of something big and productive.
So there is an excuse that should convince the most unimaginative people and anti-dreamers to believe that dreams are of a great deal of value. It was a dream after all that gave me the power to finish this essay.

FIJY1057,3.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,2.5,3.5,All armies should consist entirely of professional soldiers: there is no value in a system of military service,"
In Finland we have national military service system. It means that every man who has reached his majority must choose between military service and civil service. This military service takes nine to eleven months whereas civil service is a little longer, taking thirteen months. Most of the men prefer military service, because it has become a sort of tradition in out country and if you are going to choose civil service instead, the people often consider you to a somehow weird person. Army is traditionally seen as a ""school"" where the boys grow up to men. It is expected from everyone that they are patriotic and loyal to their country when it's time to defense it. In Israel this national service has been expanded to concern women as well, so they get a military training too.
Some countries, however, have chosen to have a ""voluntary"" army. The soldiers in these armies are very well trained and their education is much larger and longer than that in national service system. They are often well paid and very motivated. Usually these soldiers make a life-long career in army. The United States of America is one good example of this system; it works quite well there. This professional army system should not be mixed up with mercenary soldiers, who fight against any people or nation as long as they are paid for it. Usually they are working for no particular army but switching armies and countries quite often.
I think the professional army system is in many cases much more effective than national service system because of the motivation and expansive training of the soldiers. They are not likely to flee from a threatening enemy, because fighting is their job and they are paid for doing it. Also the results are usually better, because the soldiers have been taught all the possible tricks and techniques. But this system also has its weak points. It is very expensive because of the hired soldiers. It can also tempt ""worse"" stuff who can use their skills to criminal purposes. Of course this problem can exist in all army systems and thus is not typical of this system only.
There are some other cases, though, where the national service system is better. In the small countries there are nor enough men neither economic possibilities to follow this idea. Usually the inhabitants of these small countries are somewhat patriotic and proud of the independence of their country and that makes them defense their land enthustically from the enemy. In my opinion the national service system fits into today's Finland perfectly. All the boys know what they are expected to do and everybody thinks it is quite alright this way.
We are moving towards uniting Europe and there is going to be some great changes on account of it. I think the previous army systems should be changed as well. I think the European Union should have an army consisted entirely of professional soldiers. I don't see it reasonable that the soldiers from national armies should be sent to an another part of Europe to fight for the Union. There should be the European professional army instead which would have soldiers from all the European countries.

Money. It is a necessity in this modern world for all those who are interested in surviving. It used to be less important when goods were exchanged for other goods, and sometimes money was not used at all. This was usual especially in the countryside because of agriculture. But things changed, and now money is considered to be a symbol of power and status.
Today money is everywhere. Watch TV, listen to the radio, read papers, politicians counting and speculating whether there is enough money for the next year. And of course the calculations are made on the basis of economical balance instead of looking deeper into the reality and the ones that it bites.
Money is something that divides people into two groups: there are the poor and there are the rich. If we forget our selfishness for a while and just think of some principles of democracy, we should notice that there is something wrong with this world. Could it be possible that drug problems, violence and dishonesty had some kind of message?
Is money so important that people are willing to do anything in order to become wealthier? From a distance, it is very easy to be hypocritical and say that I would not do so. Yes, that could be possible if I happened to be a relatively ""good"" person, who is aware of things that have caused my situation so that I do not have to accuse myself of it. But what if I were brought up in an environment with very negative attitudes and boredom, where people were brought up to despise social groups that differ from yours? In the belief that there is no future?
Since money seems to be so necessary, it would be quite hard to change the system so that money was not there. But there has to be something that can be done! We could think. Think carefully. What are our values? What else is there in the world in addition to money? Again, it is easy for me to say if I have little economical difficulties in my life. But I have to generalize and hope for the best. So, expanding our world to a more democratical direction may be benefitial. If it cannot be seen tomorrow, well, maybe its time comes later. But if we just stand still without thinking, changes are unlikely.
There is still a question that needs to be answered. What is the role of money in the play of Evil? Is money the thing that causes all the problems on earth? Well, it is true that man is weak and selfish, but undoubtedly money is something that eagerly feeds the hungry ones. In its own way.

Dreams and imagination are powers that keep pushing us towards a new day. Dreams give us strenght and imagination makes our life more colourful and exciting. Some people say that in our technologized and industrialized world there is no room for dreams and imagination. imyself would like to think that these two things are such essential parts of human nature that they will stay as a prt of us whatever the world around us may be.
First of all, isn't it true that mostly all the technology and science we have today is a product of somebody's imagination. The dreams of moving faster and flying like a bird drove someone to invent the aeroplane. not only knowledge, but also imagination is needed in most of the new inventions. One could say that imagination is much more daring than scientifical knowledge. It can cross boundaries of knowledge and it constantly pushes the limits of reality further back. the technology needs both dreams and imagination.
In the middle of our world one can feel very lonely and sense hostility and agression in the society around us. I am sure that many people share the dream of a peaceful and quiet place surrounded by protecting nature somewhere that's green. many people would like to turn back time back to the times of a more natural way of living. All those things and many more are within everybody's reach via dreams.
Even though our world is much faster and somehow our life is more predictable than the one of our ancestors, we all stop to dream of something every now and then. Dreams are a thing no-one can take from us no matter how hard he tried. Of course some dreams get crushed along the way, but from the ashes of a dream rises another like the Phoenix. Dreams and imagination can be a way to escape from the wicked world or they can be used to make our life more exciting as it it here and now.
It is said that television and technological toys destroy a child's imagination, but when one watches children play one sees that the plot of the TV- serties is only the base stories and games are built on. The child only uses them as material. Quite often the ready made ideas and stories simply don't fit in the games at all. the mechanical toy has become a tool of the child's imagination.
It is true that some of our dreams strongly reflect our world as it is now. we dream of money, being slim and beautiful etc. the society we live in happens to be somewhat superficial and naturally so are many of our dreams. Money has a huge role in our life today. If one listens to people's dreams they are often of wealth. One wishes that one wouldn't have to worry about money all the time. During the financial depression many people have had to re-arrange their lives completely. With imagination and hope they have found new directions for their lives, lots of new things to do with their lives. The important values in life have been under a large change.
Dreams and imagination are an important oart of our lives. Without them we wouldn't have what we have now. With them we can head towards the future with great expectations of a better world.

FIJY1062,4.0,3.5,,,,,"In his novel ""Animal Farm"" George Orwell wrote ""All men are equal but some are more equal than others"". How true is this today?","
Recently there has been a great deal of controversy about equality. More and more people have noticed all injustice and inequality around them and even in their own lives. Media; TV, radio and newspapers allow nobody to ignore the problem we are facing.
It is more than difficult to define what equality is or who are equal. Some are satisfied and happy with less than others and still do not feel being mistreated. Equality can be described to concern for instance men and women, rich and poor or developed and developing countries. Being equal and impartial starts on an individual level expanding itself to be a matter between genders, nationalities, races, even to reflect the relationship between man and beast.
In the society some hundred years ago it was taken for granted that man was the head of the family supporting it and making the important decisions. Woman was to be at home taking care of children and doing housechores. We must remember that the situation described suited in the time's world and can not be compared to the way we are living now. Earlier big families and tight relationships between relatives were of great value. The importance of social class and status was emphasized.
Nowadays the border between man's and woman's role is far from clear. Women have started to demand their rights and equality between genders. This has led to a strong movement: feminism, whose advocates have sometimes gone even too far in their idealism. Eventhough they have accomplished a lot for women's favour but still we cannot talk about absolute equality. Some of the most arguable issues are salaries and military service.
Another character in the modern world compared to that of a hundred years ago, is that the rich are getting richer and the poor even poorer. The division between people according to their property is especially alarming in the Third World, for example in Egypt, South-Africa and in countries like Brazil and The Philippines.
Culture is the factor which dictates how equality is either described in theory or applied in practise. In India the caste system was suppressed decents ago but still castes influence people's lives. In the Western countries culture is very modern and liberal. Individuality is respected and people are judged by their thoughts, not by their looks or money. Of course the system does not always work in the way it should. The musical My fair lady parodies the meaning of dialects in Britain in a funny way. Brits recognize a person's hometown and background by the way he or she talks and this increaces prejudice and despise.
Since religion affects millions of people, its role should not be underestimated. Different religions teach different kinds of approaches to equality. In Saudi-Arabia or in the Middle East the influence of Islam can be recognized. Women have to hide themselves so as not to provoke other men than their husbands, while men rule the world. Girl babies are a shame to their fathers and the law, The Koran, says that women have to be punished twice the hard as men for the same crime. Hinduism teaches that people are just that fortunate as they can be, depending on what they have done in their previous lives. So no one can accuse nobody else of their bad situation than themselves and it is fair to treat people according to their social class.
It is obvious that we cannot reach absolute equality but we sure can level down social differences. The privileged countries and individuals must give up thier superior attitudes and support the inferior. Also the ones suffering have to demand their rights and point out the defects. Being fair and equal starts when each and every one of us decides to work for justice.

FIJY1063,3.5,4.0,,,,,"In the words of the old song: ""Money is the root of all evil""","
Money is an essential part of our everyday life. The desire to get more of it or the lack of it can be motives of a crime. But there are also other reasons that poison peoples minds. From another viewpoint, having money can make some people very happy and many good things can be accomplished with the help of money, when on the other hand the most reasons for happiness have nothing to do with money. Therefore money can be the motive for evil, but the root of all evil lies somewhere else.
To a great extent money does make the world go around. Even if the modern man was able to find food from nature and build a shack into a forest he would eventually have to face the question, would he be able to survive through winter. He would also have to make sure that he is not on somebody's property. And how would he keep himself clean and find himself some clothes? What would happen if he fell ill? In this sense money is the root of life, at least in modern societies. There are of course still peoples in the world that live in primitive conditions and get along fine without money but most of us would not be able to do that anymore. The modern man needs to buy medicine, food, clothes, sanitary ware and many other everyday items.
Due to the important role of money in our society it has become something that everyone desires to have. It is true that having money creates the feeling of security. Those who have it do not have to worry about for example next month's rent. However there are things that money cannot buy. Happiness, love, friendship and success in work are few examples of the most important prerequisites of a well-balanced life. Of course it would be wonderful to have so much money that one would never have to worry about it, and I am sure that everyone dreams of it every now and then. However, my point is that there are many other things in life that can make people much happier than money. Sometimes the economic situation like the recession today helps people to see that they can be perfectly happy without being able to buy those new, fancy and expensive achievements of modern technology that they constantly see advertised in television.
Sometimes money becomes too important for some people. They have to get more of it. In addition to the feeling of security, it is either the horrible pain of jealousy eating their hearts out or the ambitious urge to get more power in society that make people do amazing and often illegal things to get more money. It is like an obsession to some people. They also seem to think that rich people are highly respected in society but in reality in many cases this respect turns out to be fawning, the rich being surrounded by a bunch of bootlickers. Money brings power because the rich can use their money to get what they want. The more money one has the more people he can bribe. For those people who have such needs money can become very important.
The lust for power is closely related to the ""illness"" called jealousy. Most people would not be able to watch without envious thoughts their neighbour drive his new Mercedes up the driveway. This kind of attitude is very common in competitive societies, and United States is a very good example of a country where people are constantly competing against each other. There are two groups, winners and loosers and the urge to win is the force that helps people fight all through their lives. Here again money comes into the picture. Without it, it is impossible to get such status symbols as fancy, new cars and car phones which are essential items for winners. There is of course nothing wrong in being jealous or wanting to do well in terms of money, but often things get out of hand. The motives for theft, burglery and illegal activity in business are often related with money.
Evil is not caused by money. Money is merely a trigger which lauches the poisoned mind to do evil things. The same applies conversely: the lack of money does not create evil, it is society that has put so much weight to money that people start to think they must get it one way or another. Those people who steal or harm other people in any way are mentally ill, temporarily or cronically. Greed, hatred, revenge, jealousy, even love can sometimes get out of hand and poison one's mind. It is normal for people to express their feelings, although that is also something which depends on the culture, but they should also be able to control them. Even though it is common to say that money can be the motive for a crime, the decision to commit a crime is made inside the criminal's head.
Based on the arguments I have presented above my opinion is that money or the lack of it can become a problem for some people but there are other roots for evil. Money is merely a device for trade, the root of all evil lies in people's minds: attitudes and greed.

Echoes and desolate shadows in the empty streets. Blocks of concrete sighing and leaning against each other. Infinite emptiness filled with vanity. I curl myself up like an embryo looking into the dephts of my soul. There is something moving inside me but it is all grey...
Today's world keeps on turning faster and faster and the people feel more or less dizzy. We spin around helplessly until we drop. We are obsessed with gaining high positions and collecting capital to ensure ourselves that our life is efficient enough. Salesmen and advertises do their best to convince us that every single piece of modern tehnology is vital for our survival. But who survives in the end?
Humans are strange creatures. They have to know everything. They continuosly seek explanations trying to get to the bottom of things. In their great curiosity and enthusiasm they have crossed the line. By entering unknown territories and carrying out sense less experiments they cause a huge amount of harm and suffering. However, it has to be admitted that a great number of these experiments have resulted in remarkable discoveries and inventions. But the price has often been unreasonably high - and we are still paying for some of them.
In the early days people had to be content with what they could see and hear. Incomprehensible things were explained by myths and legends which were passed from a generation to another. People did not rely as much on their reasoning as on their basic instinct and on the things they could sense around them. As a result of this, stories were an inreplaceable part of everyday life.
In a way modern technology supresses imagination. Far too much of the information we obtain is chewed up and analysed already for us. There are so many things we take for granted and never stop to think about. Sometimes it feels as if we had lost our spontanious perspective and have become too serious and sceptical. Our attitude is completely different from that of our predecessors who saw aurora borealis as being sparks caused by a fox tapping its tail on the top of a mountain. We shake our heads and say that it is caused by atomic particles collidimg with air molecules in the upper layers of atmosphere. What is the difference?
On the other hand the advanced technology is an exiting source of new ideas. Sciense fiction stories have been told and written for decades and some of them may seem somewhat amusing and old-fashioned but new ones are conceived all the time to meet with the demands of the current society. When another mile post in the field of technology has been reached, authors have surely come up with something totally new.
""Imagination os more important than knowledge"" has Albert Einstein said. Concidering the man's achievments, this statement should seriously be taken into account. Not only is imagination important for our mental balance but it also reveals the infinite creativity within our minds. Every once in a while we should say good-bye to the golden principles of logic and let our intuition rule. We might be surprised. Technology is to a great extent a very good and helpful thing but it can let us down. The thing that will not is imagination. Let it loose!

FIJY1069,4.0,2.5,,,,,All armies should consist entirely of professional soldiers: there is no value in a system of military service,"
""War is an extension of foreign politics"", as certain diplomat once said. The impact of armies to our history has been tremendous throughout centuries. A nation cannot be considered a superpower unless it has strong armed forces. So, what makes up an effective army? There are many different opinions concerning the proportions of an ideal army. The size of an army must be related to the size of the nation. An army of massive size is of no use if the nation cannot support it. But the size of an army is not the only factor involved. Besides the proportions of different branches of the army, the backbone must be considered with greater care. The backbone is, of course, an individual soldier. These individual men and women form the core of any army, even in the hi tech world we live in today. Let's take a closer look.
Different countries have different kinds of armed forces. Some countries use the drafting (or conscription) system to take young men and women into the ranks of fighting troops. Some use full, trained reserves, i.e. all men have a short basic training period, after which they are issued weapons and equipment to keep in their homes. After the basic training they attend regular training camps to slowly build up their competence. In case of war, these reserves are mobilized quickly. Then there are full professional armies. These hire trained, professional soldiers to do the fighting. Special educational military institutions train these professional soldiers for their duties. Full mercenary system is not used anywhere except in the Vatican, which has Swiss mercenaries in their service.
One very important aspect is the motivation of each individual soldier and therefore, the whole army. All mentioned systems have their pros and cons. The national service (i.e. draft system) is relatively inexpensive to maintain, as there are no salaries to pay, except the regular personnel. The only large expenditures are the maintaining costs of the army and the purchase of new equipment. What are the negative sides, then? It is the morale of these fighting troops that contributes greatly to the effectiveness of an army. If men lack the patriotism and will to defend their home country, then all battles against a better motivated army will be lost, it is as simple as that.
Let us take the professional army system into consideration as what comes to the morale of fighting troops. At first, all wannabe-soldiers go through a sieve to even enlist in the military school. If they cannot keep up, they drop out. That means only the best will ever graduate. After graduation, the personnel joins their respective units. They all get paid for that. If you have chosen the military career and you gain good salary, will you not be better motivated than a man who was dragged into the army against his will and all he gets is a lousy daily allowance? Of course, this system has its negative effects. The salary for all soldiers is going to cost much money for the government if they intend to keep a relatively large army.
All other systems are not easily adaptable for many countries. The professional army is the best solution if the government is willing to pay for their independence, so to speak. Those days are gone when men fought valiantly for their country, no matter what the payment was. The new generation has lost the pride and respect for their home country, as unfortunate it is.

FIJY1070,3.5,3.0,,,,,"In the words of the old song: ""Money is the root of all evil""","
Ever since the use of money has been invented, people have had to experience such things as poverty, greed, unequalness etc. All in all it has brought many negative things with it, it's almost impossible to think of something positive it has given to humanity - I mean it's just easier to pay with money (or nowadays with credit card) than exchange squirrel's furs, isn't? So introducing money as means of buying and selling was just a matter of convenience.
It's hard even to imagine, what it was like when money didn't exist. I guess the cavemen living in the stoneage exchnaged for example furs for food, but it was just an exchange - there was no currency, rabbit furs weren't cavemens' way of paying for something. However, I'm certain that the cavemen did steal from eachother and also tried to cheat when exchanging things.
Crime is, in my opinion, the biggest problem that money has created for societies. Crime together with greed, that belongs to the human nature, have caused nothing but sorrow and disappointments for people. That's why we can't ever have a true paradise - humans are greedy and they use every possible chance to get more; more money, more land etc.
Come to think of it, there actually is one positive thing that money has brought together with all the bad qualities it possesses and that is the fact that one currency has united people into one nation. It has created a feeling of belonging and proudness in people to actually have their own currency. Nowadays it makes people (at least in Finland) a bit cautious, when the European Community talks about ecu. That would, for us, mean the loss of the Finnish Mark which was born together with the republic called Finland. Some people have even said that you can judge the nation on the basis of what its money looks like. I don't know, if this is true, but what is certain, is that money does unite people (at least in some sense).
If one takes an entirely different point of view to money - a biblical view - one can see that even then money was actually considered the root of all evil. The Lord told us to give all our earthly belongings away, because you had better chances in getting into heaven, if you were poor. Another good example is that Judas was paid to deny that he knew Jesus.
On the whole, one cannot think of today's modern and civilized world without having to admit taht without money - or should I say ""the invention of currency"" - all this surrounding us would never have been possible. Even the words in a popular song say : . It just seems evident, even to me, that humanity needs this socalled root of evil to develope and expand its limits. Maybe it was the devil's invention to reveal all the bad qualities in human beings, but money is necessay for everyday life, so we just have to cope with ourselves in the best way we can.

It has been said that wars will not be fought by foot soldiers in the future, that the next war is going to be a nuclear one and that there is no need for old fashioned armies any more, but if you just watch the evening news you will notice that today men with guns are fighting wars all over the world.
There are quite a few people in Finland who resist the national service system and would prefer a professional army. Most of them argue that the soldiers in our present system are not enough motivated and that the soldiers do not gain sufficient knowledge and skills on warfare in their training where as if there were a pay-army, only those motivated would join and would all be professionals. I quite agree, but there are a couple of points that weigh in the scale, too. Firstly, if the men of this country don't think our countries worth defending, then I don't think there is a need for any kind of army. Secondly, I believe that a lot of the training now could be done more efficiently and even in a more compact form which would also shorten the length of the service and thus cut down the costs.
An army is first and foremost a threat for other nations. It is there to show that a country is prepared to defend itself. The army then needs to be sufficient enough to form a threat that is believable. For a nation like Finland small in population with such a vast area to defend it is also necessary to think about the effectiveness of its army should there ever be a need to take military action. We need to be able to move large numbers of soldiers in a crisis situation. Both of these points suggest that an army very small in man number could not handle it all. Training the men and then having them in the Reserves is a very practical system to operate with. It gives the possibility to gather up in a fairly short time an army that outnumbers any possible pay-army in Finland. To form such a grate professional army would surely create jobs, but where could the country get the money to pay all their wages?
In my opinion all people are equal. So, women should take part in the national service as well. But it is up to the society to decide what values it carries: Should women be sent to the front line with men or not? Military service could be compulsory for women. There are other skills, such as first aid, organising temporary shelter, transmitting information, that are useful in war like situations or when some catastrophe arises. Many people object to this, but after all we should not consider what is convenient for a single member of the public but what serves best for the country.
It is not possible to speak in the favour of one system or an other the same way in every case. All countries have to decide which form is best for them. And no one knows what kind of military unions the EC will bring along should Finland join, but for now we should cover our own backs. For Finland national service is the only reasonable option.

There are not many countries in the world that do not have an army. At least some kind of military defence is generally thought to be necessary for a country to maintain independence. It is logical to think that a big country needs a big army and a small counry is happy with a smaller one. However, if a small country wishes to become a bigger one, a rather large army is mostly recommended. Luckily, expansionism is not very popular in the world right now, although dozens of wars are in progress constantly.
As said, if a country wishes to stay independent, it must in a crisis be able to defend itself. The use of force requires manpower. The more manpower, the more powerful country. Or is it ? Is the crucial question the amount of troops or the quality of the soldiers? Armies can roughly be divided into two categories; professional armies and armies based on national service, which basically consist of the whole male population, which in a critical situation is mobilized. Both forms possess some positive and negative features.
Perhaps the first thing that comes to mind when thinking of the positive aspects of national service is the wideness of material. Nowadays almost every young man gets some kind of military training. After one's service it is possible to enter cadet school and make a living out of training other people to fight. Civil service has also become an option in the recent years. It seems probable here in finland too, that women will be allowed to join the army in the near future as well, which has been the case in some countries for a long time. This expands the material even more. On the other hand, if almost everyone can be recruited, the material is certainly of very variable quality. To some people the discipline and the very punctual life may cause lots of personalproblems. Mental problems are in fact quite common, even suicides have been committed. The officers' and the trainers' personalities and attitudes towards their job have a strong effect on the general atmosphere in the unit. If the trainer is very harsh and frightening - let alone bullying - and the conscript has no one to talk to, he may face some serious problems. Moreover, in the army you have no privacy. You have to live very near to other people, people you don't necessarily like. This kind of situation requires a lot of compromises and capability to adjust oneself.
It must also be kept in mind that since anyone can join the army, a lot of criminal and mentally ill material is provided with an access to a place where weapons, ammunition and explosives etc. are easilly available. It really isn't very difficult for some lunatic to kill someone if he really wants to. To avoid this kind of incidents, there should be strict tests before one can join the army, and no person with a criminal record should be allowed to join.
This problem doesn't exist in professional army. No government would pay to incompetent soldiers. If there were a professional army, it would decrease the mental sufferings of young men, because there would be no obligatory military service. It is true that a professional army would be far more skillful and better trained than an army based on national service, but it's size would in a country of Finland's size be too small to seem credible in the eyes of other countries.
It would, in my opinion, be suitable for a country like Finland to maintain it's present system and not to consider raising a professional army whatsoever.

FIJY1075,2.5,3.0,,,,,Feminists have done more harm to the cause of women than good,"
I am a feminist; I just don't want to brag about it. The word 'feminist' has many negative connotations, and anyone who claims to be one is immediately labelled as being hostile towards men in general. A stereotype of a feminist is a woman who is ready to take extreme action just to be noticed. She cuts her hair off, dresses in baggy clothes and never wears any make-up because she does not want to look feminine. She takes life very seriously, and spends most of her time feeling hurt or planning revenge because some selfsatisfied person has made a chauvinist remark again.
That is not how I see myself. And I believe that many women would say the same for themselves. At the next moment it is easy to deny the need for feminism, too. It is human: nobody wants to belong to a group of such unpleasant, maybe even frightening, people. However, very few would deny their need for equality.
The world is full of male chauvinism. It is easy to percieve that both in big and in small things even in Finland - a country famous for equality between men and women. Those jobs which are usually considered to be on women's domain are more poorly paid and less appreciated than those that men usually have. Someone has claimed that even universities are losing their value because of all the women studying and working there. A woman who wants to have a career is considered a bad mother if she has children. If she doesn't, she is less respected as a woman. The fellow workers of a man do not necessarily even know if he has children; his top priority is work, and that is taken for granted by everybody. In everyday life women are more often objects of sexual harrasment and belittlement than men. How many times does a man hear such a remark as 'You're cute when you get mad'?
So, it is obvious that feminism is absolutely necessary. However, some women refuse to have anything to do with it. They say that they don't need it. It is nonsense to claim that a single person could protect her social rights and fight for more appreciation of women. No one is strong enough to do that alone. It is as if a hungry person in some third world country said that he is the architect of his own fortune. The situation he is in is not his fault, neither can he solve the big problem ultimately by himself.
The extreme signs of feminism in the beginning of the movement, burning the bra for example, caused such a shock in the world that they have never been forgotten. They were signs of frustration, naive attempts to change the world, and, yet, the stereotype of a feminist is still based on them. But something had to be done then. Nowadays we must be grateful to those who were brave enough to start questioning the old truths. Maybe they didn't always know how to express themselves, and sometimes it became more important to scandalize the society than to work for equality between sexes. However, the consequense of all that was positive rather than negative.
Feminism does not have to be a feared phenomenon anymore. One does not have to be so privileged a person as before to be able to have and express opinions of social injustices. Even a shy person, like myself, or even a man can be a feminist. There is no contradiction in it if we all are fighting for a common cause: a more tolerant world.

I think there was a time when the defenition of the word ""crime"" was quite clear. That certainly is not the case any more. Circumstances have changed dramatically over the years and things have gotten much more complicated. Crime is not what it used to be -I think people actually miss ""the good old days"" when there still was some sense to this all. Even the crooks showed some respect back then.
Just to have to start thinking about the different forms and levels of crime, gives me a headache. It is not easy to slide back and forth between the thin lines of everything that either is or is not illegal. Let us take blackmailing for example. You can do it in so many different ways: You can be nice and suggest something, and yet make it clear that that is how it is going to be, or else. If you are being ""a nice guy"" it is hard to figure out when you are crossing the line, the line between being a lawbinding citizen or a criminal. That is just one case out of millions of similar ones.
So, what has all that got to do whith me? Well, I have to get along in this world - just like everybody else. As a student I have to cope with the high prices of food and other basic stuff I need to stay alive and well. My parents are not exactly rich and therefore I am forced to survive with practically no money at all (the lousy allowance from the state does not count). So, does it ever cross my mind to get the money ""somewhere else"", in a less honest way? Well, yes it does. I never do it, though. Maybe I would if I knew just how. I am just a regular little citizen from a regular little town, who does not know shit about the littlelest thing called cheating.
So, how could I even begin to plan doing something bigger than that. It is not like it would not be worth it. I mean, look at the big shots running their fancy firms and companies. If they get a little ""carried away"" with their business deals and a few million dollars disappear in the process, what do they get? Nothing, nothing at all. Nobody lifts a finger to get these asses to pay for what they have done. The crooks will carry on forever with whatever they were doing. They will educate the potential future generations to do the same. The fact is, that if you are big and powerful you can get away with it, someway or another.
There is that one ""but"" ,though, and it is not a small one. A matter of conscience. I believe most people prefer to keep it clear - a clear conscience - and some people seem to lack this ""state of mind"" totally. I, for one, know that I could not live with my guilty conscience if I did something illegal, or even something considered to be morally wrong. I would hate myself. I would be the worst judge of my doings. So, no matter what the ,for example, financial benefits were, I could not be a thief, a murderer, a drug dealer, or a member of some mafia, because my conscience will keep me clear and clean. So, the way I see it, crime does not pay, unless if you can live with a big burden called guilty conscience.

These days it may seem that the soft values of our community have been all forgotten. Commercial powers guide this world towards greater and greater economic growth. Welfare increases, but only in some parts of the world. People of these few welfare states consume the biggest part of the world's products and the rest of the mankind wavers at the limits of its endurance. Newspapers inform us of the catastrophes caused by nature forces, terrorists, wars or human factor - carelessness. Nostradamus predicted the third World War to happen in this century. The humankind is using up the nature. Greed and indifference rule the world.
In a world like this, a place where living is like a gamble, it seems quite impossible to think about finding a place where dreams could still be alive. But I think there is some evidence to be found that proves the existence of hope and good will even today. International organizations like United Nations and its suborganisations do their significant work and carry out their acts of humanity. There are organizations which are trying to preserve peace and stop the violence against human beings and animals as well as the rest of the living nature. Educational work is being done to mould people's attitudes and make them aware of the values that might be worth embracing. Churches do missionary work and bring the people not only the word of God but also material goods. There are many people who participate voluntarily in the acts of humanity for unselfish goals. People make their dreams come true, they start families and wish to be able to offer their children a good, safe childhood.
Dreamers and idealists are often frowned upon as being useless idlers, even though they are partly the world's insurance for keeping up the life that will be worth living. There are quite certainly several good things in the world that have only existed as a result of somebody's dream come true. But dreams don't even have to come true to enrich one's life. Sometimes it is enough just to stop for a while, shut one's eyes and let the imagination fly. It may seem difficult just to turn on the dreaming part of yourself when there is always the constant hurry and awareness of time that runs by in the background. But if you can find a quiet moment there are ways to compose your thoughts. As an instance: The right kind of music can get you into an imaginative state of mind. For example listening to some classic records or Suzanne Vega it is - at least for me - very easy to escape the world and think of being in a better place.
I think there will always be a place for dreaming in the world, as long as there are people who have imagination and the desire for dreaming in themselves. The place and time don't matter, the most important thing is what you have inside your head and in your heart. In spite of the hard values of our community neither idealism nor the spirit of dreaming has died.

What is this peculiar ability humans have? In our heads we create people, things, places and events that have never existed. Animals can not do this. If country horses dream of city lights, I owe them an apology.
I have dreamed in a loo and in a car. I have dreamed while staring at the reflection of my pale face in an underground window. Well, the window was quite dirty so I couldn't see very clearly. You can dream on your way to work. In this case public transportation is recommendable so that the number of traffic accidents does not increase considerably. If no other place is free, there is always the place for dreams and imagination - gas station. Sweet dreams are guaranteed. The smell of gas and grease will make your head spill with dreams. Spare time helps dreaming but it is not vital. When you follow a routine, the mind flies. The more monotonous a job is, the better it is for dreaming and most people have always had boring jobs. That is why we are so good in dreaming. Think about peasants who lived two hundred years ago. I bet working the field was so dull but hard that they had to dream in order just to stay alive. People dream because they want their dirty dishes to be clean. Dishes are never clean but for a while it might seem like that if I, I mean you...we imagine real hard. Some want a better life up above, down under, anywhere. You might want to lose yourself and then reappear as a fisherman. Perhaps not the best but the easiest way is to imagine.
Television is full of moviemakers' and advertisers' dreams. Whether they are bad or good dreams, I am not sure. I sometimes steal something from television; an image or just a couple of words. Soon these words and images mix with the ones already in my head and they become my property. Some people watch too much television. If you are constantly in someone else's dream, your own dreams fade away. Be careful, it is a slippery screen!
My dreams are made of scrap iron and weeds with red leaves falling down from heavens to the ground. We see things when we sleep. Why are they called dreams? I would not them to happen in real life. They are too painful, too shameful, too strange.
Long ago we started dreaming about great future. The next thing we know, we have highways, perfume sprays and no ozone layer. The whole thing happened very fast because we were able to imagine, instead of trial and error all the time. It was not only one person who dreamed everything. You could say our mutual imagination made it happen. Some people's dreams influenced more than others' but we all are responsible for letting the great future get out of our hands. ""Everyone is guilty of everything."" Mice did not do it, squirrels did not do it. They couldn't because they can't dream. Maybe they will learn. Humans dream too big and it destroys us (but not tomorrow, don't worry). Still our normal life is built on imagination. If we stop dreaming, we die.

The urgent need for imagination During the last decade of the twentieth century, it is easy to exemplify how science, industrialisation and technology have pervaded our everyday life.
Some will claim that the increasing number of factories has spoiled the landscape's attraction. Others assert that imagination and dreams have definitely vanished from our modern society.
In order to avoid any narrow-mindedness, it would be more appropriate to tackle the problem of technology versus imagination within a larger framework.
For obvious reasons, men have always struggled to improve theirknowledge of the universe as a whole. Since the most striking evidence of progress is to be found in science and technology, many people tend to blame these areas of knowledge for the loss of imagination and it socrrelated dreams.
However, it very often occurs that imagination operates as a kind of catalyst for major scientific or technological changes. Let us take an example from strip cartoons: when Herg sketches Tintin's first steps on the moon, who can predict that such a dream-like experience will actually take place some years later?
If we jump back to the fifteenth century, we notice that Leonardo da Vinci already mixes his artistic gifts with a more analytical approach to space, since he is also famous for having improved numerous textile machines as well as engines of war (so that many princes called on his competence as a military engineer).
These two examples illustrate that creative imagination can be closely linked with scientifice progress - in a direct or indirect way.
Writers, painters, architects and other artists have more than once contributed to break fresh grounds in the study of science and technology.
Nevertheless, it would be unfair not to mention the dangers of a society governed by an increasing number of new technology.
More and more people complain about the consequences of automation: if it does lighten the burden of fastidious tasks in daily life, it may also lead to a paralysis of our creativeness.
Once again, it is worth stating here that numerous artists - and especially fiction writers - have put pen to paper in order to describe the dangers of the new technology.
Indeed, in the twentieth century, fears for the future of mankind have predominated over the optimism about inevitable progress which was more typical of the nineteenth century, and this has led to a new kind of utopian writing, portraying our own society set in the future, showing our fears realized. For this kind of literary work, the term ""dystopia"" has been invented. The first striking example was Aldous Huxley's  (1932), enhancing the deadness of a civilization which has come to be dominated by scientific technology. George Orwell's 1984 is a nightmare about twentieth century political totalitarianism, enlightening about the dehumanization of a society entirely controlled by computers.
All these examples point out that artists (that is to say people who give shape to their dreams and imagination through works of art) either play the role of catalysts for technological progresses, or that of a railing against the uses and abuses of science and industrialisation.

FRUB1004,3.0,3.0,,,,,Feminists have done more harm to the cause of women than good,"
Feminists have done more harm to the cause of women than good It is not uncommon to overhear, or even participate in , a heated debate started by general statements such as ""the immigrants take our jobs"", ""homosexuality should be condemned"" or ""feminists do mor harm than good to the cause of women"". Quarrels about such subjects rarely lead to a satisfying conclusion : the debaters remain, more often than not, convinced that their position is the only right one. The reason for this unconclusiveness probably lies in the fact that affirmations like the ones just mentioned are too general, too abstract, to be good starting-points.
The first thing to do the, is defining the terms. Taking the statement about feminists, for instance, it may be useful to check what ""feminism"" is. In the O.A.L.D., we find ; , and a feminist is . Saying that women -and men, for that matter- trying to obtain equal rights for both sexes do more harm than good to thecause of women seems, at best, paradoxical.
It is, moreover, quite difficult to speak of ""feminism"" in general terms as it is a social and political, dynamic, movement. This means that it has changed over the years as it gained importance and popularity. Goals aimed at by feminists have changed as well, victories have been won, other battles remain to be fought.
The current rejection of feminism by both men and women may in fact be the consequence of its success : on the one hand, women of the younger generation have legal and political rights, equal to those of men -in our countries at least- without having had to fight for them, whereas our grand-mothers remember days when they were denied equal salaries, or the vote, or simply good education, on accounts of their sex. For the younger generation, then, there seems to be no need for further claims, hence feminism is now obsolete.
On the other hand, in the case of men defending the idea that feminism is harmful to the cause of women, another kind of ansiety is expressed. Indeed, they have had to retreat gradually fro mtheir patriarchal position, to learn to share power and knowledge, and they of course tend to feel that ""enough is enough"", that the situation might run out of hand, and that women might claim still more until men are deprived of everything.
Clearly, one cannot doubt that feminism has had positive results, and is still necessary. The question is not whether one should be a feminist or not, but rather what kind of feminist one wants to be. Indeed, some women tend to be ""hyper-feminists"": what they stand for is not equality between sexes, but a complete reversal of the roles, a kind of revenge. This type of feminism obviously does more harm than good to women, as it is essentially unrealistic and aggressive. Men are bound to rebel against it, and to use it to repress every women's movement, thus leading us back to the situation faced by the first feminists.
Gross abstractions such as the ones cited in the introduction are generally the expression of fear in the face of change or crisis. As such, they should not lead to quarrels. But such statements are used by political and religious leaders to manipulate the people, enticing them to reject foreigners, homosexuals, women, among others. That is why it is so important to recontextualise such affirmations, to show that they may be right in certain cases, but that they are wrong in most. As for feminism, it was said to be ""unfeminine"" because women used ""male tactics"" instead of their alleged ""feminine weapons"". The vocabulary itself expresses the invasion of male territory: we speak of ""victories"", ""battles"", ""weapons"", ""tactics"" etc. And yet, is there another way to force people to listen? It is quite natural that men are reluctant to give up their hegemony, but it is certainly no less natural, and essential, that women, among other ""minorities"", claim their share of ""human rights"". Especially in times of crisis. Especialy now.

Money is the root of all evil This assertion may be false on the one hand because human beings need money to live on for some of us at least to survive.
Let us think to all the poor people in the world who desperately seek money to live at subsistence level, let us think to the third-world who asks the so-called industrialized and rich countries to help them in keeping alive their people. We must remember all the concerts organized to raise money and this to save people or countries from starvation.
There had been ""USA for Africa"", ""Band Aid"". So they stood up for starvation but also for many illness, notably AIDS or leukaemia or simply to save the world, let us remeber the concert to save the Amazonian forest.
On the other hand money perverts those who exaggerate, it is a kind of escalation iin the scale of possession, because for this kind of people possession rhymes with power and domination.
Let us give good and convincing examples of people perverted by money. Two or three days ago, a bank director robbed his own bank, he then left the country with his private secretary. why some famous ministers falsify their accounts, if not for money. Why do they risk to loose their job, their notoriety, their self respect? The only possible reason is money attraction.
There are only two subjects on earth that have the power to pervert people and to make them do anything crazy, those two subjects are love and money.
Therefore we can consider that love and money are the roots of all evil.
So money really perverts people, because if we look at the politics side we will see politicians playing with their money either to buy voters or trying to raise funds. Some organizations are known to use their money to commit crimes, murders, to buy or sell drugs, in one word, actually drug traffic.
Some countries use their power to buy weapons and then to sell them to other countries in need, during wars for instance. Some countries use their power and their money to help researchers in the elaboration of nuclear weapons that are each time more sophisticated and this for the country to acquire each time more power, and may be to be the leader in one field.
But sometimes countries want and need researchers not only for bad discoveries but also for good ones.
Actually all the industrialized world pays for scientific discoveries, we must not forget all the progress made in the medical field for example. Discoveries are also made during space researches.All thisrequire money.
If we look at it, all in all, we need money to make science and to build up history, to give it to those who don't possess it, to survive and even to live comfortably.
But some of us use it in a bad way that is either they want to earn more even if they resort to illegal transactions or they spend the money they have, to acquire power.
So, to sum it up there are pros and cons in money, it al depends on what you do with it.

Feminists have done more harm to the cause of women than good On the contrary, according to me feminists have done more good than harm to the cause of women. Forty years ago the french philosopher Simone de Beauvoir declared that  . It has been a difficult birth but today a woman's place is not only in the home. Women are more independent, more self-reliant, more confident and more powerful than ever before. Just look around: women are found in almost every profession. There are women doctors, professors, fire fighters and carpenter; we must not forget that Britain had a woman prime minister. Therefore and undoubtedly the women's liberation movement has made a remarkable progress, but there is still a long way to go. Many men argue that women are just not suitable for certain jobs, they say that they are weaker, more emotional and less practical than men. These arguments, however, are not convincing. Research has shown time and time again that the differences within each sex are greater taht the differences between them. There are just as many weak, emotional, unpractical men as there are strong and practical women. The major problem is one of prejudice, which is rooted in our upbringing and education. We say that women are adept with a needle and thread so why shouldn't they make first-class surgeons? We assume that women are better at listening and solving emotional problems than men, so why so few women priests? To some extent, I think that things will improve in the near future.
In the fifties Simone de Beauvoir's free woman was just being born, now in the nineties she is learning to walk. It is high time men ceased to regard women as second-class citizen. This is supposed to be an enlightened age, but you wouldn't think so if you could hear what the average man thinks of the average woman. Women, as I have already said, won their independence years ago. After a long struggle they now enjoy the same educational opportunities as men in most parts of the world. They have proved repeatedly that they are equal and often superior to men (yes, this is a man who is writing!!!) in almost every field. The battle for recognition has been won, but it is by no means over. It is men, not women who still carry on the sex war because their attitude remains hostile. Women continue to be regarded as second-class citizens. When you hear some men talk, you think that women belong to a different species. The same jokes about women drivers are repeated day after day. However we all know that women cause far fewer accidents than men. Moreover, women have succeeded in any job you care to name. As politicians, soldiers, doctors, university professors, company directors, scientists, presidents, etc... Yet men go on claiming that there are many jobs women cannot do. Top-level political negociation between countries, business and banking are almost entirely controlled by men, who jealously guard their so-called ""rights"". Even in enlightened places like Switzerland women haven't been given the vote. The arguments that men (except me!) put forward to exclude women from these fields are too familiar. Women, they say, are unreliable and irrational. They depend too little on cool reasoning and too much on intuition and instinct in order to arrive at decisions. They are not even capable of thinking clearly. Yet when women prove their abilities, men refuse to recognize them and give them their due. The truth is that men cling to their supremacy because of their inferiority complex. They know in their hearts that women are superior and they are afraid of being beaten at their own game. I think that one of the most important tasks in the world is to achieve peace between the nations and I claim that you can be sure that if women were allowed to sit round the conference table, they would succeed where men have failed for centuries. Some things are too important to be left to men...

FRUB1009,3.5,2.5,,,,,Feminists have done more harm to the cause of women than good,"
Feminists have done more harm to the cause of women than good When we think about the advances achieved by the feminists, we systematically call to mind the women's movement of the 60/70ies. We must not forget however that many of the goals that women have been trying to attain these last 30 years had already been fought for during the 19th century. Some preliminary signs of this fight can already be found in the late 18th century, when in 1792 Mary Wollstonecraft published  in which she rejects the image of the woman as a toy and pleads for the women's right to a decent education. And the fight is still going on. Rightly? Has not feminism served its time? Has it not eventually done more harm to the cause of women than good? In other words has feminism come to be beside the point?
Feminism originates in the need for the equality of the sexes. Has this equality been arrived at? In theory, it has been achieved because this right for equality has been put into legal terms. There is a legal principle of public international order that states the equality of the sexes. This certainly would not have happened without the feminist revolution.
We really should not overlook the good done by feminists to the cause of women. These two last decades have not seen many changes concerning women but there have been some. For instance, the obligatory mention of both sexes in advertisements for situations vacant or more recently the legal provisions as far as sexual harassment is concerned (although these provisions are not restricted to women, I guess mal victims are fewer in number than female ones).
Although there have been few changes which we can remember these last years, we really should take our hats off to feminists: they have been challenging a mentality established since the beginnings of the world and for a great part improving it. Is not one of the oldest traces of the representation of woman subordinated to man to be found in the Genesis? Is not woman said to have been born out of a man's rib? Was she not doomed to keep man company? Worse, is she not the one that sinned first?
The problem is that even if such an international principle for equality has been established, some countries still keep on violating it (mostly in countries where religion prevails over international rights). It is in these countries that improvements are needed. The fight is now reduced to a matter of controlling whether this principle is applied or not and is no longer the exclusive task of feminists.
When feminism stops fighting for equality, it begins to assert the superiority of woman upon man and such discourse is always alarming. Feminists have done enough good for the cause of women, let us prevent them from doing too much.

FRUB1010,3.5,3.0,,,,,Feminists have done more harm to the cause of women than good,"
Feminists have done more harm to the cause of women than good In this essay I will deal with the intricate and tricky problem of the feminism. The question that arises here is: Is it so that feminists have done more harm to the cause of women than good? I will attempt to show that their actions have brought not only advantages to women but inconveniences too.
First of all, it is important to highlight the fact that the situation of women greatly improved this last century. They gained the right to vote, to give their opinion, and to involve themselves into the working life.
Moreover, women were freed from men's authority, they began to go to school, and therefore to work, to earn their own living. In other words they obtained independence and freedom. But they had to battle fiercely to reach that stage of affair and sometimes they even had to resort to violence in order to obtain satisfaction. Here, let me remind you of the fact that most men were totally opposed to this emancipation, they regarded women as stupid and inferior human beings whose duty was to stay at home, to keep house, to cook the meal, and above all to take care of the children.
What is more, although a lot of progress has been made on that ground, women have not reached equality yet and it is highly possible that they will never be considered to be the equals to men. There are nevertheless some obvious reasons for this. First, women are not entitled to do heavy labour as men are. Second, a lot of men still believe that women are inferior, they consider that the members of the weaker sex have to obey them and to submit to their wishes.
Finally, women are still put at a disadvantage when they apply for a job. Sexism has always been present in that case and some people seem to be of the opinion that it will never disappear. As a matter of fact, some employers take on members of the stronger sex more willingly than those of the weaker sex. Others still refuse to collaborate with female beings or to have them as manager. Others have a tendency to underpay women, that is to say that they offer them lower wages than those they would give to men in the same position..
Then, now that most women are working it has been noticed that the number of divorces is constantly increasing. Nowadays, women are free to leave the marital home if there are problems and that happens because they are now financially independent. Needless to say that such a thing would never have happened in the past when they were dependent on men. At the time they had no other alternative than to accept lfie as it was, to submit to their husband and to put up a good show.
An other problem women have to face is the overload of work: they have indeed to cope with their job, with their households, and with their children. No wonder that so much work wears them out and that they collapse either mentally or physically. Afterall, you cannot bite off more than you can chew.
As a conclusion, women have gained freedom and independence thanks to the feminist movement, their situation has greatly improved, they are no longer a slave two their husband, they are no longer mere objects the duty of which is to keep house. But, as the proverb says,  and women have to accept the other side of the coin, that is to say inconveniences, problems, sexism, heavy labour, rivalry, and competition.

FRUB1012,2.5,3.0,,,,,"In his novel ""Animal Farm"" George Orwell wrote ""All men are equal but some are more equal than others"". How true is this today?","
Some men are more equal than others We could have a long debate about the semantic and linguistic nature of the word ""equal"" but one thing is sure: ""equal"" does not always mean ""equal"".
All men are supposed to be created equal, to grow and to live equal but this is only theoritical. In practice we can wonder whether it is possible and anyway, it is not true.
A first reason to this, and this is something we cannot change, is that there are many differences between men, betweeen men and women, between adults and children, between babies and grown-ups, between the old and the young...
Every individual is unique, as well physically as morally. Everyone is different from the point of view of intelligence, of character, of feelings, of behaviour,... and therefore it is obvious that everyone will adapt differently to his/her world, will face problems in a different way and this might result in being treated differently by the others.
From this point of view it seems a utopia to think that men are equal. But I think that different and unequal is not the same. We can say that someone is superior to someone else in strength, in intelligence, that someone is older, taller, fatter than someone else but I do not agree with caling a person an inferior being. Moreover we must not forget that everything is relative and that a superiority for a person and under certain circumstances can be an inferiority for another person under other circumstances.
I think that the main problem is the relationship between the strong and the weak. The strong consider the weak as inferior and treat them as such. They dominate them and impose their rules on them and this is a total lack of respect. It seems that the law of nature has always prevailed since man exists and it will be difficult to change it all. The strong have always had prejudices towards the weak, the small, the poor, the diseased, the stupid... but they are unfortunately rarely justified.
Let us give a clear example of my opinion: if someone applies for a job which requires certain qualifications, it might be logical to pay him/her less than forseen if this person does not correspond to what is required but I do not see why a black man or a woman who could do this job properly would be paid less than a black man. I do not see why people should pay for their so-called objects, why people should be rejected for them (I mean suffer).
Of course it is easy to understand that a small, ugly, stupid, uneducated, poor and weak person will have more difficulties to have friends, to seduce a person of the opposite sex, to find a job,... but I cannot stand the rejection of these people or their being unemployed.
We must not forget that if people are different, they are not necessarily responsible for it. The place you are born in, the education you get, the money you can count on, the people you meet are all important factors which make people different, which give them unequal chances to reach the welfare every human being has the right to hope. The world cannot change completely but people should be treated more equally as much as possible.

FRUB1015,3.0,2.5,,,,,"Some people say that in our modern world, dominated by science and technology and industrialisation, there is no longer a place for dreaming and imagination. What is your opinion?","
Is there a place for dreaming and imagination?
When the word ""modern society"" is uttered, a whole lot of concepts come immediately to mind. The concepts of profit making, of money, of science technology, of industrialisation, of progress and of struggle for ""life"", i.e. a luxuous kind of life. And this is exactly what we find in everyday life. Can you imagine living without a car, a television, a microwave oven, a video recorder, a computer,...? Seriously not!
The advantages modern society brought us are so well rooted in our life that we no longer think about them as technology. But as these concepts filled in our life, we can wonder whether there is still a place for dreaming and imagination.
We could think that there is no place for it and quite a lot of people do think that way. But I personally am convinced that dreaming is still there, somewhere, but closer than you could imagine. Indeed imagination is important in technology, is not technology a product of imagination? Creating and inventing new techniques involves imagination. These two notions cannot be dissociated.
Another field in which dreaming is necessary is the relaxation field. If you do not relax, even during a short period of time, you cannot go on living the way you do. Without dreams man would die. Do not dreams invade our unconsciousness each and every night? We should not underestimate the power of dreaming and imagination. It is an emergency exit helping us to deal with modern life, i.e. with tension, stress, struggle and overwork. Of course the content of the dreams is another problem, it deals with modern society and therefore technology. But industrialisation does not invade all our being, we managed to keep a small part to dreaming, and this is important.
In other words, we could say that technology is a product of imagination and at the same time produces dreams and desires. We always want more than we already have, this phenomenon is what we call a consumer society.
Another point I would like to make is that years ago what was important was profit and work, there was no place for saunter. Wasting one's time dreaming about was considered as a serious mistake. On the contrary, nowadays imagination is encouraged, it is a necessary step to take towards technology and progress. Obviously people could not go on forgetting about their basic needs, i.e. dreams and came to the awareness that technology and science could not exist and develop without inventiveness. As I already wrote before, these two concepts are indissociable.
As a conclusion, I can say that contrary to what it seems to be like, dreaming and imagination play an important role in our modern society and this role will perhaps increase in importance in the near future. Without the presence of these emergency exits in our lives, we will inevitably slip towards depression and maybe death, at least the death of our spirit. That is why it is high time we realize that there is a place, and an important one, for imagination and that we cannot muzzle it.

For ages, men have always been affected by discrepancies in social, economic and cultural status. And in a way, we could assert that those inequalities are justified and encouraged by Nature: we are all born biologically equal, but we are endowed with different mental potentialities, each of us embodying a unique version of Man, undergoing an individual education, growing in various types of religious and political environments - with different backgrounds, habits, and concepts.
In our materialistic world, man's lust for power is undoubtful. While ""power"" essentially meant ""fire"" to our primitive ancestors, it is now often a synonym of money, and - to a larger extent - territory. And this fascination for possession has often led men to commit the most barbarian atrocities towards their fellow-creatures. Once men feel inferior - because they are poorer than their direct neighbours -, they may turn into real warriors; and all this violence, only for the sake of control, domination, ""power"".
Sexism also emerged from that idea: at the turn of the century, women became more and more independent, trying to acquire a social aura similar to that of men. In doing so, they claimed the equality of the sexes, but also the right to earn their living on their own. Once again, a question of (financial) power started a whole series of outrages against the ""fair sex"", and still today, even if men and women are supposed to be born equal, there is no need to examplify the fact that most men still tend to consider their female counterparts as being inferior - and consequently, many abnormalities privileging men have been covered up.
Not only sexism, but also racism is a direct implication of Orwell's statement. Too many racial crimes were perpetrated in the name of a so-called ""superiority of the white"" over all the other ethnic groups.
Religious intolerance is another form of discrimination, which is still ferociously menacing throughout the world: the division of the Irish people is a blatant example of this.
Many humanitarian associations try to fight those inequalities, but are they ever going to succeed in solving the problem? Is man ever going to become aware of all the evil and suffering he brings about in acting so selfishly and so power-huntingly? I guess Orwell already anticipated the answer...
Equality like objectivity is a utopia or a mere delusive belief, an ideal never to be reached. Every being is unique and is (I hope) never going to sacrifice his or her uniqueness for the mere sake of equality; because this would only mean nivelling, and as a consequence of it, the loss of one of the most precious human quality, that is to say identity. But that would definitely be intolerable!

FRUB1021,3.5,3.5,,,,,All armies should consist entirely of professional soldiers: there is no value in a system of military service,"
In our western countries the problem posed by volountary military enrolment as opposed to compulsory service has become the centre of controversial debates.
Through the ages, the role of the army has basically changed: the ""citizen-soldier"" of the ancient world has successively become the defensor of his faith in the Middle Ages, the territorial conqueror of the last centuries and the political dissuasor of the great super-powers. Only recently the military corps has been involved in humanitary intervention; the offensive nature of the military forces has then turned into a defensive conception.
Some countries like the USA or the United Kingdom have already opted for army forces exclusively composed by volounteers; but the great majority of the nations still maintains the obligatory military service.
Both systems have their advantages and invonvenients, but it seems clear that the major criticisms are levelled at the compulsory military service. The most general negative feeling is that the year spent in the army is a great waste of money and time. The costs that a nation has to endorse to subsidize its army will carry a serious weight in the national budget, and some people would prefer to see these gigantic amounts invested in other activities like social assistance or economical renewal. The obligatory service also creates problems from a professional point of view: to go into the army often means to loose one's treatment for one year if not even the job itself. Moreover, it delays the entry in professional life of those who just finished their studies, and takes away from them the opportunity of properly searching a job.
Besides these rather material preoccupations, people have more and more developed a tendency to pacifism: they do not want to train for an eventual war. This of course is also due to the diminishing importance of a certain sense of patriotism in our countries.
But in my opinion the main point which could argument the suppression of the obligatory system is the fact that nowadays, in case of conflict, the common soldier would be no longer needed: only highly specialized technicians are able to manipulate all the sophisticated guns and machines of the modern armies, as the Gulf War clearly showed us.
Although the great number of criticisms, the military service still has a rather positive connotation in the public opinion: it should create a certain sense of brotherhood between the members of the corps, and make turn boys into men, even though we all know the risks of accidents or violence during the enrolment period.
As opposed to this, the volountary service could seem the ideal solution: people who agree to join the army and are financially retributed. But here again several dangers have to be pointed out. First of all, the attraction for the money and for the promotion could be more important than the sense of patriotism: the army would then be a refuge for all the marginals and the outsiders of our wealthy societies. The second evident problem could be the eventual immaturity of the people who join the army too young or without really thinking about it. It would also be better to avoid people for whom war and violence are the only aim in life.
As a conclusion, it seems to me that utopically it would be better for humanity if there were no armies at all, but since we have to live with this reality, it would be a good solution to enrole only people who really want to join the army, and above all to give them not only a war-oriented formation, but to teach them how to keep in mind that they are not only destruction tools but also free human beings capable of alleviate human suffering, because they will be those who will intervene in case of major trouble, and they will be the most next to the suffering ones.

FRUB1022,3.0,3.5,,,,,Most university degrees are theoretical and do not prepare students for the real world. They are therefore of very little value,"
Most university degrees are theoretical and do not prepare students for the real world. They are therefore of little value. This claim witnesses not only a certain uneasiness on the part of the students but also a more general feeling of emptiness. Oddly enough, it is simultaneously a rather contemporary idea and a universal doubt. I have chosen to regard this reality from the student's point of view, for he is the most concerned.
In the first instance, it is of importance to analyse properly the signification of ""real world"". Does it refer to the working life, or to the practical knowledge of one's activity in life? Should we read in this assertion an implied contrast between two successive stages in one's life: the first, theoretical knowledge found in books, preparing the following step, the actual use of this cognizance? Clearly it states that academic knowledge has divorced from real world, that university is no school of life.
How could one agree with such a biased view. I propose in this essay to enlight the subject from a more nuanced angle. Before I set up my arguments, I would like to underline the fact that one has to distinguish between different sorts of intelligences, which should ideally complement each other. This consideration brings me to the core of the problem, the central flaw of the education system.
Admittely, one fails to bridge the gap between formal learning, that has been piled up since early times, the synthesis of which you get acquainted with at university; and the accurate understanding of it followed by an adequate actualisation.
At this point we may wonder if the task of professors goes as far as to lead us step by step, prudently spoonfeeding us; in order to help us pass successfully from the stage of understanding, integrating knowledge to the judicious release of it with regard to the existential situation. Opinions are divided on this question, but as far as I am concerned, I truly believe that this task can only be performed by each student individually. However, one is bound to take into account the fact that obviously students are still expecting an external guide to conduct them on the road of life.
Looking at the problem from a positive point of view, there is nevertheless no denying that university opens our intellectual horizons. But it does not account for an inward maturing process, built on discursive emotions, experiences pleasant, impressive, instructive, as well as disruptive, shocking or sterile; recondite sensations, feelings that teach us about human beings in their imperfections, and struggles to betterment.
The point I am making holds ground only if one considers the term ""real world"" in the sense, school of life, practical intelligence necessary to understand the complexity of human beings and adapt oneself in the world. Contrary to what might be thought, to my mind, this knowledge cannot be extracted from books. It is an experimental and personal learning. For example, others' mistakes rarely serve as warnings. In literature, as well hundreds of lives, problems, issues unfold before the reader's very eyes without having him take benefit of this precious experience.
I probably only touched upon the problem, and there remains a great deal more to say on this subject, but unfortunately the lenght restriction allowed me only to scrutinize the tip of the iceberg.
To return to the preliminary remark that a general feeling of emptiness prompted some students to doubt about the value of their university degrees; I am not alone in thinking that our modern society experiences a turning point. The advancing progress of technology and science in every field is not accompanied by a similar move in the field of ethics. The philosophical and ethical emptiness lies in this growing delay. In that case, doubts arise as to what extent universty still fulfills a role that society fails to provide.
As a conclusion, I am of the opinion that this respectable house of knowledge teaches us to learn rather than to comprehend the obscure mechanisms of human soul. I feel that the gist of knowledge manifests itself in our ability to expatiate it in the real world. This can be visualised as a delicious fruit that is not eatable unless one knows how to make it ripen. Therefore, in absolute terms, theoretical knowledge taught at university is not of no value. The responsability rests on the desire each of us invests in combining books' knowledge with his life's experience. And as Rabelais said each one is free to ""extract the substantial marrow"" or to ignore it.

FRUB1023,2.5,3.0,,,,,"Some people say that in our modern world, dominated by science and technology and industrialisation, there is no longer a place for dreaming and imagination. What is your opinion?","
...no longer a place for dreaming and imagining...
In the title, the author suggests that dreaming and imagination have no longer a place in our modern world. Progress would have contributed to the gradual extinction of two important faculties in a man's life.
Let us examine this proposition.
It would hardly be an exaggeration to say that a number of key issues arise from these statements. What should be established at the very outset is that the world as presented in the title of the dissertation is not modern for all of us. It is hard to open a newspaper nowadays without being confronted with countries of the Third World where industrialization and technology are almost absent and where science is of a poor help. A simple, but striking, example of this fact would be Somalia.
But what we are mainly conerned with here is dreaming and imagination. In an industrialized society as ours, in Belgium, it is universally acknowledged that we live in a world where capitalism seems triumphant. Even the most superficial look at this issue raises fundamental points about dreaming and imagination. Capitalism is the result of progress, the evolution of sciences and the increasing industrialization in our Western countries. From all this it follows that time is of the most importance. The consequences of this fact are that contemporary men have no time to waste in dreaming and imagination, that what they are actually concerned with are the ways of getting more and more money.
My own view of this is that money is not reconcilable with dreaming and imagination. I feel strongly that the dreams of modern men are vanishing into the air. It is important to realize that stress plays an important part in our life. Not only does stress prevents us from dreaming, but it also prevents us from imagining. A further complication is that men tend to increase progress, and as a consequence to diminish the vital faculties such as dreaming and imagining.
There is, however, a strong possibility that our society is still dreaming. But what sort of dreams are these? A better life, involving more money, more comfort, etc... My personal opinion of this is that dreams have changed with the evolution of progress. People do not dream of the same things as they used to do.
What conclusions can be drawn from all this? The best way of summming up the arguments I have put forward for the vanishing of dreams and imagination is that people find more interests in earning money than in a better, but less materialistic, life.

FRUB1024,3.5,3.5,,,,,The prison system is outdated. No civilized society should punish its criminals: it should rehabilitate them,"
The prison system is outdated....
The concept of prison was created a long time ago. As far as we can think men who committed all sorts of crimes were cut off for a while, or even for ever from society. Some criminals were executed, some were sent away for hard labour, and some had to stay in cells.
Throughout the centuries, this concept of prison, has of course undergone changes. Until the 19th century, the mental defective and those who suffered from epilepsy were also sent to prison. This of course, with the development of medecine, and with science in general changed in the 20th century.
Nowadays, the way prisoners are treated in prison is discussed in many countries. Also their way of life changed tremendously. These changes are the fruit of our modern civilisation. We do not forget that a criminal is a human being. But the changes undertaken are not considered to be enough. Some say that the prison system is outdated, and that we should not punish but rehabilitate criminals.
The first role for which prisons were invented was to punish someone who did something illegal. These punishments of course were of different kinds. Before the law became stable a lot of miscarriages of justice have been committed. Law is a very strict institution and we should all respect it. Since the childhood we are aware of the kind of punishment we could endure for such or such action. It is a sort of pact we have to accept so that we can live in a peaceful and organised society.
Prisons exist not only to punish criminals, but also to protect the population. Criminals are sent to prison so that the rest of the population could remain quiet. We have here another role given to prisons. It should keep criminals apart from the society so that the ""good"" and the ""bad"" remain separate, at least for a while. We could possibly not release criminals just after the crime has been committed without any punishment or penalization. It is also a kind of respect to the family's victim if a murder had been committed.
The justice hopes that after a short or long stay in prison, the criminal will become honest and law-abiding. That he will start a new and healthy life. Unfortunately it is seldom the case. There is no certitude that after several years in prison the criminal would behave correctly. But this certitude could be much greater if we help these prisoners and guide them while their stay in prison. Without forgetting to continue our task after the penalty. The main difficulty for someone who spent several years in prison is to reinsert into society. A criminal who has been released must not anymore be viewed as a criminal. This must be very difficult to realize. The punishment as painful and rigid as it can be does not always help insertion. This inability to reinsert life can lead the ex-criminal to commit another crime which will lead him to a new stay in prison. Nowadays our job is to rehabilitate criminals. This could lead them to a happier life and thus we will feel more secure. But it is not an easy task.
The system of rehabilitating criminals will not suite everybody. But it must not be an excuse for not trying to reeducate them. The prison will thus become a ""reeducation center"". During the penalty the prisoner will be taken charge of. It will not be a punishment anymore but a sort of guideline to a better life. Everything must be done so that the criminal will become someone trustful. When he will be released the society will be ready to welcome him.
We are now approaching the end of the 20th century. The next century should be based on better human relationship and understanding. As we know that our actual prison system is note appropriate, it could be a challenge to try to rehabilitate criminals instead of punishing them.

FRUB1026,3.0,2.0,,,,,The prison system is outdated. No civilized society should punish its criminals: it should rehabilitate them,"
The prison system is outdated...
A century ago, punishment was for many decades the only objective of the penitentiary system in our capitalistic societies.
Liberalism, whose essential pillars were nothing else but capital and propriety, could not tolerate to see the values affected, upon which a whole system was lying. Therefore penal law had to be clear - hence known to everyone - discursive and had to provide for severe penalty; it should also thrust aside, and this for a more or less long period of time, people, whose behaviour endangered the economical policy of the time.
Our penal system today is still much marked with such a state of mind and we had to wait until the creation of the ""socialisms"" to see our leaders especially in our kingdom provide the penitentiary system with a new approach: an individualization as to the execution of the penalty. Therefore, during his detention, the criminal will be looked after, helped in a very simple way of course, but in a way that enables him/her to ""re-socialize"" himself/herself. Release of prisoner on parole, which has been on the carpet these last times, is probably the most representative example. That it is an important step forward to rehabilitation (which implies a recovery of civil rights) is undeniable but the results we get are mostly approximate.
Too great a deal of recidivist criminals is still to be found and in spite of all these measures they can not escape the inevitable return in the world of violence. The problem of rehabilitation is of paramount importance for the means that the penitentiary authorities have at their disposal are quite laughable and yet these are the only ones: they endeavour in a few months' or years' time to provide the prisoners with all the things that our society has still not yet been able to offer them: work, culture, knowledge, ...
This represents an enormous task which is unfortunately often unrealizable and unrealized; moreover this lack leads them most of the time to their previous state.
Society is thus unable to give offenders what they require from it; what our society actually bring when these people find themselves in difficult situations (crisis, moral or social situations) is emprisonment!
The reasons explaining delinquency are of various kinds: this phenomenon usually appears after a sequence of diverse failures: families, scholastic, financial, ... so that juvenile delinquents or first offenders for most find themselves left alone and, socially speaking, in a ""deadlock"", that is to say in a material but also intellectual misery. This constitutes the very start of a deliquency, often rude and violent.
One of the prison's aims is thus to fight against this precarious social contex in order to allow the prisoners to get out of their awkward position but an enormous difficulty remains: they are supposed to manage a ""reconversion"" where all the rest has failed; or if not then the delinquent will constantly repeat his offences.
Prison has many aims: it ought to function as a school (a social and moral one), a hospital, a psychiatric hospital, a health centre and it should also be all ears to the misery of all its occupants... all this with with ridiculous means, which enable that institution to bring the redeeming work that should actually be its own to a satisfactory conclusion.

...no longer a place for dreaming and imagination...
It is a fact that our modern world is dominated by only one word, namely speed.
Nowadays, people get up early in the morning, rush to work, rush back home in the afternoon, then rush to bed. The same takes place in the next morning, and throughout the years, up to the moment they die. If we observe the majority of people, we can clearly claim that more than the half of them suffer from stress. They don't take the time to breathe, to listen to the others, to live. Before, the whole family was sitting together at the same table for the same meal that had been prepared with love by the mother of the family. Mothers were there to take care of the education of their children and their only concern was their family. Nowadays they take their children back from school or a day nursery in the end of the afternoon and leave them in front of the television. Family values were much more important in our grand parents' time. They spent their evening together, talking and telling stories. Together, they were dreaming of better days if the family was poor or were telling stories that they held from their own grand parents.
In the summer they went through fields for long walks and they lived at the speed of the seasons. The world at that time was slower and the majority of its inhabitants were healtier. The food also was much more natural than the chemical products we eat now and that are cooked in less than ten minutes.
Literature is the best proof that at that time people were draming and had imagination. The stories of the Bronte sisters or Jane Austin for example are full of these elements. They offer their reader the oportunity to transport himself into another world. It is no longer the case with the proliferation of those so-called novels that you can buy in a station and read in less than three hours. But there again there are a mere reflection of our modern world. Our society has no time to sit for two hours a day and read a book. They turn the television on and watch it. And there again, what they see on television doesn't allow them to dream. If you watch the news, the keywords are death and war all over the world. And even the planet is dying. If one is conscious of the fact that it also means the death of the individual it is no subject to dream about but rather a subject for a nightmare.
The true values were much more important before. Love, peace, nature, family could be found much more easily than today. In our modern society, the computer is more and more taking the place of the human being. Once again, it is the best way to take dream and imagination away as we all know that machines have no feeling contrary to the human being. That is the biggest difference between our grand parents' world and our world. We are replaced by machines and like the machines we act. No place for feelings and love or satisfactory family relationships. Our grand parents took the time to live, to love and knew what those words mean. We no longer do. Man, nowadays is alienated by the world he has created.

The most striking features of our modern world is the idea of progress which is particularly linked with the industrial revolution throughout the 19th century. This never-ending need for investigation of new fields, for discoveries, for improvement of our standard of living as well as the accumulation of knowledge are the sources of our blindness to our war-torn, decaying planet.
Man has enriched his life by creating physical mobility (through the motor-car, the aeroplane, the train and other means of mechanical transport), telecommunications (TV, radio, telephone), and mechanization, but all this at the cost of an imbalance between man and nature.
With the development of industrialisation we see the apparition of great cities where too large masses of human beings are crowded together deprived of the necessities of life, i.e. the possibility to be in harmony with nature, to breathe the fresh country air, to avoid the nuisance of noise.
As a result man is faced with a dilemma: he is torn by his desire to advance whatever happens and his awareness of jeopardizing nature and the following generations as well as of being powerless. As a matter of fact cities are racing off in every directions, the world population is going up, urban car density is increasing, people are obliged to go further and further away to reach open air and the ozone layer is peeling away. All this does account for some really antisocial tendencies in modern urban growth. In short man is part of a process in which he undergoes a change from a state of overbearing creature towards a state of victim: the result of a competition of man against man and of his erroneous belief in possessing the earth.
All around the world we don't seem to care enough about nature, but for different reasons: - The North endangers life on earth with its economic development and its desire to improve our standard of living.
- The South damages the planet because of its poverty. People are obliged to destroy their environment in order to survive. Nowadays we are aware that the safeguard of our planet depends on a balance between the North and the South. We will always need the economic growth and the technical advance of industrialized countries but they will have to set up an economy based on a poorest consumption of energy and natural resources. If we want to stop the rising population rate and the destruction of our environment, we'll have to improve everybody's standard of living. The industrialized countries have to ensure the Third World a better integration in the economic system.
As a result there is a close link between ecology and economy: the threat of pollution begins to influence our behaviour as consumers: we buy ecological products (without phosphate, mercury) such as washing powder, battery...
It is obvious that our environment that determines our evolution is no more essentially physical but chiefly conditioned by the ideals we believe in: here education plays an important role in the sense that children must be taught how to respect nature in everyday life. Teachers' task is to heighten pupils' awareness of the economic and ideological stakes as well as of their role in the evolution of the planet.
Our duty is to remain aware that within 50 years we have destroyed what nature has been creating through the ages.

FRUB2002,3.5,3.5,,,,,Most university degrees are theoretical and do not prepare students for the real world. They are therefore of very little value,"
I chose this subject because the title stroke me when I first read it. Moreover, I have a marked preference for this subject for two main reasons. The first one being that it directly concerns me. I am indeed a university student and when I discuss with people around me I often heard this thought that is in fact half true and this constitutes the second reason which I will develop in this essay.
As avery 'good' student, I looked up in the dictionnary the word 'theoretical' and I found the following definition : . It is a fact that a teacher of English has only five hours of practice during his/her four years of studies which is practically nothing. But on the other hand, the student is not only suppose to swallow theory. On the contrary, one of the main university's aim is to form a way of thinking, of argumenting about a precise theme. There is a very famous quotation that resumes this thought; it says that a head has to be well-made, not full of theories. It is this way of thinking, the student's ability to study, read, write and understand that will enable him/her to work eventhough he/she has very little professional experience.
As far as the second sentence of the title of this essay is concerned, I entirely disagree with it, otherwise I would not be a university student. I think that on the contrary a university degree has a great value. This degree is the symbol for a intellectual maturity the student has gained during the four or five years with the help of the professors, assistants and the other students. A university student not only has lessons of general interests and specialized courses but he/she has to realize a final work which will reflect his/her intellectual qualities, a thing which is not at all of 'littlle value'.
Another great advantage for university students is what they learn outside the courses. I want to speak about the cultural as well as the non-cultural hobbies. There is a flexibility in the schedule of a university student. He/she never has courses all day long from Monday till Friday. This allows him/her to do a lot of activities that will enrich the student's personality. On the one hand, ther are, what I call, the non-cultural activities which are the practice of sport, the relationships created in university with the folklore evenings, the various jobs and many other things. On the other hand, we have the cultural pastime such as the theatre and cinema evenings, the conferences and debates, the classical and non-classical concerts. All these things are not possible to be realized by students who have courses from morning till evening and who have regularly homeworks to do.
I think I expressed all the ideas by briefly resuming them one by one, hoping that the ones who thought that this sentence about university studies was true will read this essay and be convinced of the contrary.

""Once upon a time ..."". This little magic sentence sounds like belonging to an old past for ever buried for many of us. Not only because we are no children any longer, but because of the evolution of our society. Some people say that in our modern world, dominated by science, technology and industrialisation, there is no longer a place for dreaming and imagination. Are they right? I am not sure about that ...
I do really think that our ""modern world"" can be a source of inspiration and dreaming. There are a lot of people who share my opinion. There are, first of all, the readers of science fiction magazines and books. Science and technology fascinate many youths, who dream of robots and of conquerring other planets (after the moon) of our solar system. Though it has been many years that the first rocket has been launched into space, such an event still attracts crowds of people, better than a football match or a theatre performance would do. Even for a simple display of air strength, a hot air balloons show or fireworks, you will see hundreds of faces looking up to the sky accompanied by admiration cries.
All those montgolfiers, planes or zeppelins have moreover been sung of by the Italian futurists. These avant-garde artists were keen on modern machines, their dynamism, their speed or their strength. Trains too were painted a lot (by Delvaux, for instance). Yes, there is no doubt about that, techniques are a source of inspiration, indeed.
I agree that such machines and techniques may not be appreciated by many of us. I understand very well this point of view : grey factories are impressive and polluting, computers are repulsive with their black ""face"" and their strange sounds, robots are cold and so well programmed ... too inhuman. So, just therefore, we should not feel depressed. We, as humans, are different. We can dream and escape in imaginery worlds. Besides, it is self-evident that television, cinema, theatre, literature help us to forget our industrialized society, the humdrum routine of everyday life, reality. Yet, what has made possible our possessing magazines or television sets? It is clear that we owe them to progresses in technology. Even if your preferred activity is simply to go out for a walk in natural landscapes, do not forget that your sport shoes have been made by a factory!
Of course, science is everywhere. We have come to a point where we need it, even to dream or to relax. There is no reason to feel uneasy about that, this fact is due to the natural course of evolution.
However, we will always need to dream. That is why books are sold, and book fairs have success, that is also why so many people go and see movies or watch at television. There is also this other dream, that you actually realise each year : go on holidays, look for exotism, learn about another way of life, relax in front of the sea, lie under the sun, rediscover the pleasure of a life free of worries. All the year long we work thinking of those few weeks where we will get all the time wished to ... dream!

FRUB2005,3.0,2.5,,,,,"In the words of the old song: ""Money is the root of all evil""","
All over the world, money is used for measuring value, for storing wealth and for buying or selling goods. This explains why money is so important and so necessary in our modern society.
Unfortunately money also corrupts society and its members, for people view it as an aim rather than as a means. And the words of the old saying ""money is the root of all evil"" may turn out to be true.
Our modern society is regulated by a capitalist economy. In such a society people's duty is to increase their wealth. Everyone tries to protect his own interest, and at the same time neglects the interests of others. Moreover money is linked with the notion of power, rich people often occupy important positions in society. The poorest people moan about the successes and rewards of others. They make envious remarks and become jealous. So money provokes covetousness, bitterness and resentment. It may even cause hatred and violence. This makes it obvious that greed is one of the most important problem, which we have to deal with in our society. The strong desire for money can indeed destroy happy families, it is quite common to see children quarrelling over money after their parent's death. Money can provoke war between countries. Everyone should remember Sadam Hussein's attack on Kuweit. Sadam's invasion can hardly be justified, when it is explained that Kuweit is one of the richest countries in the world. He saw in this country the perfect means to increase his wealth and power. Sadam's plan shows that some people resort to illegal and dishonest means to gain money. They steal from others what they dream of, or swindle their contemporaries without any remorse. What is quite alarming is that most people forget that money is a means, not an aim. Consequently they reject real human values, which are : honesty, love of one's neighbour, respect, solidarity and charity toward others. Even the most honest people can be tempted to satisfy their craving for money. However money in itself is not bad. It simply depends on what people do with it. It can not be denied that money is one of the basis of our modern society, it enables people to live in a decent and comfortable way, by supplying all their needs. Without money it would be impossible to buy the most essential goods.
Of course the richer people are, the easier it becomes for them to acquire these goods.
Money gives other satisfactions as well. How would it be possible without any money to help people who are in trouble? How could society fight against poverty, starvation, sickness and all the other social ills? Money also contributes to the development in science, art and technology. And finally it appears as a means of collective utility by assuring people's well-being through the creation of a good administration, through the maintenance of an army and the development of cultural structures. So money is an important factor contributing to the progress and stability of our society.
To conclude money is useful, as long as it helps people to respect true human values and to put them into practice. But if it used for another purpose, it has to be condemned and rejected - like any evil force.

FRUB2006,3.0,,,,,,"Some people say that in our modern world, dominated by science and technology and industrialisation, there is no longer a place for dreaming and imagination. What is your opinion?","
Ever since the industrial revolution which have radically marked the transition from small family enterprises with a low rate of production to a more and more intensive mode of production, our modern world has undergone a whole range of various transformations. Despite the fixed terminology focussing essentially on the industrial aspect of this revolution, it has to be seen as a general upheaval which has influenced or even drastically modified numerous fields of human society. The result was not only a growing mechanization and rate of productivity but also a change in people's habits and way of life and other sides of their existences. As a matter of fact, all human occupations are so entangled that it makes all attempts at dissociating them almost impossible. I think that this industrial revolution would rather be considered as the starting point of many other changes or as the first element of a chain reaction. Fortunately human beings' well-known enormous faculty for adaptation has permitted them to cope with the situation as satisfactorily as it possibly was. On the other hand, a complete and perfect adaptation to every aspects of these changes was totally unconceivable and might even have destroyed all the basis of humanity themselves : it might have resulted in utter submersion and domination of science, technology and industrialisation. Although human beings and their traditional values have never been destroyed, they have been dangerously threatened by and subordinated to modern technique and its financial interests. Humanity has incessantly been put to the test but has never given up affirming its infinite superiority which is precisely characterized by that what is not material, such as screws, cogs or productions. Indeed, what else could be the reason for this resistance if not this feeling of integrity, this deep-rooted sense of superiority and independence, this irresitible need to evade oneself in a world of dreams, ideals and imagination?
In our modern societies more than anywhere else, I think it is absolutely imperative to maintain a sort of 'haven of peace' in our busy everyday life. This inner world is at everybody's disposal and everybody should make good use of this incomperable treasure in order to sustain routine, stress and all the big or small difficulties entcountered during the day and caused mainly by the intensive activity of our modern world. As a matter of fact, most of our fellow citizens do not even know anymore what life really is absorbed as they are in their everyday life. Some are indeed so worried about their daily activities that they get bored once they have free-time. Others, more pragmatic and realistic, take time to take realities into account and to relax, free their spirits. In this case the world of dreams and imagination is to be considered as a safety valve which allows people to decompress and release their frustrations. Some creative people make the most of their spare time to imagine or even build things, others create works of art, which are fruits of their inmost beings. Some prefer to get benefit from some talentuous artistic production, such as paintings in an art gallery, books in a library or music from a reccord. Nevertheless, the cheapest and easiest way of evading oneself is certainly day-dreaming, making plans for the future or living temporarily in an imaginery world of one's own, full of ideals and dreams. This type of evasion is, of course, at everybody's hand and is impossible to challenge because nobody or nothing can prevent people from thinking and dreaming : this is one of the most precious richnesses of all human beings and one of their most distinctive signs.
To conclude I shall once more insist on the fact that a world in which dreams and imagination would be absent would certainly not be worth living in. This perspective, however, really seems unthinkable, as this intimate place couldn't possibly be harmed by simple material conditions. How could we prevent human beings from dreaming?

FRUB2007,4.0,3.0,,,,,The prison system is outdated. No civilized society should punish its criminals: it should rehabilitate them,"
A society, in order to function, requires various constraints, among which : order. A society must have rules to which people must submit, otherwise, it would be complete chaos. It implies the necessity of the police force but also of prisons, for it is clear that, if rules are established, they are there to be violated as well. It is a principle of Grice about communication : norms exist in order to be violated. That can obviously be applied to the rules of any society. Moreover, as we live in a problematic society - there is no work for everybody, conflicts emerge from everywhere, materialism creates false values, etc - many people are led to be tempted to violate the rules. Therefore, prisons are sometimes necessary.
If, I think, the prison system is essential in a society, it is not easy to create a system that can correspond to the society in question. Ours is outdated. It is in total disagreement with our way of life. We live in a period of crisis, people are blas, some are led to violate the rules for different reasons, sometimes only to survive. And it is sure that they feel alienated from their society. They disagree with the system because they do not find their place in it. My conviction is that man is done to live in society, he is not a solitary animal. If he cannot participate in the social life, he is doomed for failure. Prisons, therefore, play an important even crucial role. Before going on, I should give a definition of my conception of prison : it is not the condition of being kept in a large building as a punishment after being found guilty of a crime, it could be a way to help people to reconcile themselves with their society, a place where they recieve the possibility to be rehabilitated. It should not be felt as a punishment, it should be a place where people can put a question mark over their thinking and their behaviour. Prisoners must be surrounded with care, they must be active, they must be opened the eyes in front of life's wonders. They must come to desire to go out in order to create something.
Belgian prisons are overcrowded. Prisoners are inactive. The only resort (for most of them) they have in order to fight against boredom is drug. More than ninety percent of prisoners recieve medecines from the doctors and psychologists of the prisons. Most of them become addicted to the tranquilizings they swallow everyday. Only a small percentage of prisoners work in prison. Some learn a profession which will never serve for anything once outside, for people in general have a bad opinion of prisoners and refuse to employ them. Moreover, in prison, they see only other criminals and it is well known that the biggest criminals have known each other in prison. In short, prisons, instead of helping people to manage to get out of their plight, plunge them into despair.
Change should be envisaged. There are concrete measures to take in order to ameliorate prison's conditions. I do not think that prisons must be supressed, they are necessary : dangerous criminals must be emprisoned. But I really believe that most of the prisoners are not at the right place. Most of them just need a work and a bit of consideration. Others would rather need to be in hospitals than in prisons, I think of all the drug addicts. Prisons should be transformed in rehabilitation's centers.

FRUB2009,3.5,2.5,,,,,Feminists have done more harm to the cause of women than good,"
Most people believe that Feminism arose out of the cultural and social upheaval which took place in the 1960's. For them, Feminism is almost undistinguishable from the other ideas which are associated with that decade. Yet, the first recognisable group of women with feminist ideas appeared just before the First World War. They were called the suffergettes. Their demands were simple: the Right to vote.
For centuries, women had been belittled to the lowest level of society, and even treated almost as slaves. Following several decades of political change, (some) women decided to take advantage of it and pressure the government in recognizing the role that women played in the society in general. Unfortunately, for them, that was unacceptable, for society has been regarded for long as predominantly dominated by men. They caused severe repression against women so that the movement was eventually brought to its knees. It is only when one of the most influential countries in the world - notably, America - went through a cultural Revolution, then and only then the idea took hold among both men and women.
The core of feminist ideas lies primarily in the need for society to accept the equality (parity) of the sexes in all walks of life - to wit at work and at home. In contrast, the traditional view is that women as mothers and wives belong exclusively to the home, where their only task is foculized, or restricted to the begetting of children and their welfare. They are, however, men's flesh and blood. Such a state of mind is still present in present-day Jewish families. In public, only till recently, most women were supposed to be seen, not heard. Their rights consisted in only being a wallflower. Strange as it may seem, they were almost portrayed as belongings, or ""items"" to be traded.
Little by little, a status quo has been set up and got into a rut betwen both sexes. Women were seen conducting affairs, bringing negotiations to satisfactory conclusions in what men always claimed to be: ""a man's world"". Unfortunately, for them, females proved to be as capable, as versatile, and in some cases, even better, as men in factories and offices. Nevertheless, the result of their ability to overcome obstacles was rather mediocre inasmuch as they were only given, for instance, after the First World War, the right to vote. This newfound participation proved to be, nevertheless, one of the first of many steps to a mere semblance of equality.
After the First and Second World Wars, women were allowed small ""liberties"" rarely accorded to them beforhand. The strict code of conduct to which they had to conform in public was altered somewhat to enable them to move, speak and behave like any sane human being. Time flied until finally a more rcognisable feminist movement made its appearance in America in the 60's and got the upper hand. This movement was backed up by female intellectuals. From then on, much was written, discussed, analysed about the role that women should play in a more fair, rational present-day society. Feminism, as we understand it, was eventually brought into the world. Men and women became more accurately aware of their social differences. Sexism and sexual harassment became more ""exploited"" subjects in public debates.
However, the primary purpose of Feminism - that of informing society of the injustice women had to face up to then, became blurred. The weak points will always be this sentiment of underprivileged being's : women will never feel satisfied and regarded as equal as long as people would stick to this old clich : women are by nature inferior beings. The expected reaction to this will be inevitably the propension to go always very far, beyond the limits, exhausting all the possibilities. Feminists eventually distorted the image they wanted to project onto the public : they acquired a status bordering on superiority over men, which alienated most people from Feminism, even if this movement managed to restore dignity and pride.

FRUB2011,3.5,3.5,,,,,"Some people say that in our modern world, dominated by science and technology and industrialisation, there is no longer a place for dreaming and imagination. What is your opinion?","
The poet said: . We live in the most fabulous century of man history: the massive industrialisation of our western societies and the tremendous progress of science managed to guarantee us material well-being and comfort. But this metallic century and the speeded up development of living conditions had strong side effects on the mentality of the man in the street.
Indeed, the former morals have been left out to be replaced by new values such as competitiveness and complete materialism. The up to date dynamic junior manager is the perfect image of this phenomena. Money pervades in every aspect of social life and has become everyone's priority, forcing its rules through the sordid twists and turns of politics. We study for money, we work for money, we sell ourselves, we live for and according to money. And the more you get, the more you want.
Meanwhile, people forget the real meaning of life and quench their thirst at the wrong springs of enrichment. What has become of the primitive, the child we were once? Because, if civilization is the capacity to live in harmony with one's environment, then, the primitive is far more civilized than we are. Similarly, the poet has understood the true value of nature, which we keep on destroying nowadays, as well as the importance of the daily seizing of the present time. We have forgotten the essential: we have forgotten to DREAM ou life, conditioned by the ""having"" rather than by the ""being"". And we unconsciously undergo the thought simplification and the moronic state into which television thrusts the masses. The new wave of American Cinema also clearly illustrates this state of affairs: in current commercial box-office sells out, everything is told and showed, leaving no more place to suggestion, imagination, individual interpretation, in a word, thinking. The audience only has to swallow it all. Those blockbusters kill imagination and confine themselves to a mere function of entertainment. We have not evolved much since ""panem et circenses"".
In this context, we easily understand the necessity of the part that people like poets and artists play in the society. The poet is the perfect expression of the dissident fringe and the evanescent transcendence of imagination and dreaming. Is this marginilization casual? Through his word, the poet shares with us his special visionary talents and the result of his deep and penetrating outlook, thanks to which he brings out the essence and real dimension of things and beings. This altogether clashes with our current society which proposes a superficial vision of the world and cultivates the worship of appearances. One inevitably thinks of advertisement as the perfect image of the superficial world of the ""having"".
Following the same idea, we can admit that the modern man has lost his spirit of discovery and his ability to get surprised and moved by the most simple things, like children (or primitives), going in search of the world, in the everlasting state of awakening, amazement and humility. The modern poet is doomed to feel ill-at-ease in such a world, where the homo-politico-economicus dominates and where no imagination is required. Histoy showed us that it may even be sentenced, by exile or death, because those beings, although full of dreams and mad imagination, are above all the most perceptive and clear-minded observers of the times they live in, and this is why they represent an effective threat to every system based on dogmatic blindness of the masses, which they naturally question.
Subsequently, our so-called ""democracies"" are far from developing a critical outlook in its fellow citizens. Or if it seems so, a strong questioning of essential matters is never welcome. Of course, one has to be much more precise but is this the point, after all?
As an exemple, the typically American two-valued oriented manner of presenting social and political facts also testifies a lack of subtility that, by means of the simplification of thinking, kills imagination and dreaming.
As a conclusion, I would say that our modern world, with all its tricks and artifices, does not stimulate authentic creativity, which is vital to the Artist, the perfect dreamer who is often condemned to live as an outcast, or to integrate in a system of which he can only disapprove.

FRUB2013,3.5,2.5,,,,,"In the words of the old song: ""Money is the root of all evil""","
Money, the root of ALL evil? Certainly not, many other factors contribute to the degeneration of our civilization. Nevertheless I think money can claim being number one in that matter! Let us think of the influence money has at the level of the individual, and then at the more general level of the country.
In our merely materialistic world, money has gained such a high status that nearly reaches the level of moral value such as trust, good morality. Indeed it has become one of the criterias on which people set up judgments about the moral qualities of others. Money can even be considered as a kind of synonym for honesty, courage, intelligence, ... Moreover it is also considered as a key to success, and, therefore, as people believe, a key to happiness, which is the quest of most of us. From the moment someone finds it, envy and jealousy arise. And as bad thinking is not far from bad action, we can easily explain a high rate of thefts, hold-ups, attacks,... That has also its effect on the atmosphere and relationship between people : discomfort, fear, distrust, ... From another point of view, money causes problems in the way it is not fairly shared out among people. In other words we have rich and poor people. That raises the question of equality among men, injustice and ostracism also find expression in frustration, and once again in violence. So in this section I have shown very quickly and superficially, some of the consequences and problems caused by money.
On a larger scale, money can also affect the lives of millions of people. Indeed all nations in the world aim at gaining power, and that is mainly achieved through money. This dream, or rather obsession of power of some leaders can give way to disasters. Indeed Saddam Hussein invaded Koweit for its strategic situation and gas resources. But that need also meant thousands of victims, and could have set off a new world war. And we all know that any war allows all atrocities we can imagine. Isn't this the ultimate expression, the mirror of evil?
In those two preceeding sections, I have dealt with some of the problems caused by ""money inequality"". But the biggest problem lies in the lack of money, in those people who don't have any money at all. In our society, we need money for anything: food, clothes, home, ... Without the basic necessities, people can get ill and even die. In the same way, a country without money cannot help feeding its population, which starves and dies as we witness in some African countries. Here again we find in misery and death the incarnation of evil.
So I think money is responsible for many of our problems, notably social ones. But we could hardly make it without money. Unfortunately it has lost much of its primary function as a trade exchange value and has gained too much social value.

FRUB2014,3.5,3.0,,,,,"In his novel ""Animal Farm"" George Orwell wrote ""All men are equal but some are more equal than others"". How true is this today?","
Actually he is there revealing a universal truth guiding man from the beginning of Time. Already in ante diluvian time the struggle for fire has broken the balance, giving superiority to the tribe which possessed it. This dichotomy between the strong one and the weak one is encouraged by nature: although we are biologically equal, our mental potential is quite different considering each of us a ""unique unity"" according to the events we experience.
Nowadays fire has been replaced by ""money"", ""power"", ""violence"" and ""possession"" and maybe the most striking item would be ""colour of skin"". Racism is probably the most obvious instance of inequality. It happens everywhere and at any time: Apartheid - the Japanese community in Canada which has been sent to Ghost towns during World War II - the Indian minority ""packed"" in reservations like animals - Hitler's racial persecution and of course the recent Serb ethnic purification are maybe the best examples. The attractive power of money or territory involves men in the most atrocious barbarisms against their equal fellows.
In a different and sometimes minor way racism daily affects our acts or behaviours as ""civilized"" men. Sexism is deeply rooted in the concept of racism. Since 1948 women have acquired the right to vote, feminists movements have flourished all over the world, the sexual emancipation has made women as independent as men but still, for the same work, the same aptitudes, women do not obtain the same wages as men. Moreover women are still regarded as inferior to men though they are proved to be more resistant to ""heavy work"" than most of the representatives of the ""stronger sex"".
However, racism has not always been perpetrated in the way it is usually done i.e. when ""the omniscient white men"" impose their authority on ""the to be educated skin-coloured men"". Lately in France, just after the arrival of the new government two ""unfortunate mistakes"" - against a Zairian and a Moroccan - were perpetrated by members of the police force. Those inadmissible crimes were headlines in many newspapers in Europe. So why when an old French woman was hit a few years ago by a police car nobody heard about it? The case was carried before the court but soon given up and of course without any compensation for the poor woman who had been badly injured. This abnormality is obviously another sample of inequality!
Another example would be this affair of paedophilia - involving a priest - which was discovered a few years ago in Belgium. The outcome of the trial was quite amazing for the priest was sentenced to five years of retreat in a monastery (although his function should prevent him from behaving in such a way) while his accomplices were sentenced to prison. To my mind, this priest should have had the same punishment as his ""associates"".
All those obvious inequalities are fortunately offset by all the humanitarian associations which work to fight the discrepancies of our society. However I would not be sure that their present success will increase or be maintained in the years to come. Orwell's statement about inequality will certainly prove to be correct for ever because of man's insatiable desire for power. Equality is probably the utopia man has always thought about but as a utopia it can not be realized.

FRUB2017,3.5,3.0,,,,,The prison system is outdated. No civilized society should punish its criminals: it should rehabilitate them,"
On the 4th of May 1993, three prisoners achieved a spectacular escape from the prison of St Gilles. Today, they still run free and their feat has become an encouragement for other criminals to also try, as one might ironically say, to ""find their way to freedom"". Suddenly, the prison system emerges as a burning issue; The papers, the radio, the T.V., all the medias and of course the public opinion ask the same questions: how efficient are these institutions? are the methods used the appropriate ones? should these events be considered as mere ""incidents"" or do they reveal a more important and disturbing problem concerning our society, that is to say, its incompetence towards a number of its members?
It would be unwise to think of this issue as a national one; It has a general scope since it affects almost all countries. Such cases have indead occured world-wide. The most incredible example is the escape of 81 prisoners last year in Athens (Greece). But the most striking part of it was that after two days, more than the half of them returned to their cells on their own initiative. This fact reveals the ill-being of these persons, their desire to be set free from this system and at the same time their dependance on it.
There is therefore no doubt, criminals are special cases which need a special treatment. Our society has chosen to keep them apart from other citizens, to isolate them, to cut them away from everyday-life. This constitutes both a punishment and a protection for its other members. But then, when these convicts are released, they have enormous difficulty readapting and most of them end up in prison once more.
In these institutions, the system focuses on making them ""pay for their debts"" while it should help them to change, it should show them that another way, another orientation is possible in life. Prisons have become a place of corruption when they should be one of ""catharsis"". The medias have revealed the exchange of drugs, the murders, the violence that exist within such walls. What should be done then? which would be the best solution?
In my opinion, the methods should concentrate on their rehabilitation and therefore should be both humane and scientific. Keeping criminals together and isolated like cattle does not solve anything. Initiating them to a new life should be the main thought. The starting point would then be to use qualified personnel, especially psychologists who would evaluate them and decide what line of action should be followed in each case. The guards should also be selected according to the same criterias, since it has been proved that they play an important part in the corruption within such institutions. The next step would be to encourage the convicts to develop their interests and hobbies, that means, to help them improve their minds and personnality. A school-like prison, with courses of all kinds, would be, according to me, the most intelligent and efficient method. Education for the uneducated, further learning for the cultivated ones, psychological assistance and last, but not least, constant contacts with the outside world, would lead them to a positive evolution.
Of course such a system would demand huge sums of money which would never be awarded by the state. Moreover, all prisoners are not receptive to rehabilitation. It then appears clearly that, as for all other major sociological problems, no ideal solution can really be reached. In practice, all humanistic methods are impossible to apply. In our materialistic world, humanity is simply an idealistic and utopic notion.

FRUB2018,2.5,2.5,,,,,The prison system is outdated. No civilized society should punish its criminals: it should rehabilitate them,"
The question to know whether the prison system as we know it is appropriate comes regularly to the surface of our ""philosophical"" preoccupations. Indeed, many people with a philanthropic turn of mind suggest that this very system of imprisoning people for a crime they have been proved guilty of, is outdated. But if they are not imprisoned (or even worse: ""eliminated"", to use a softening expression), what should society do with them? That is the usually not answered question.
Not answered because not answerable? Not necessarily. Let us try to find some acceptable alternatives, or at least to imagine what would be the ideal solution (which is not likely to exist, like any ideal solution to any thing).
Should society forgive without any form of punishment? Definitely not. It would be too easy to escape. What seems to be a sensible proposition is to make the criminals conscious of what they have done, so that they will not do it again. But this may sound a bit idealistic.
Some people claim that a society which declares itself civilized should rehabilitate its criminals. Very nice, but easier to say than to put into practice. We should not forget that there are many sorts of criminals, ranging from the accidental criminals and small fry to the hardened ones, the ones ""beyond redemption"". Some of the little ones could perhaps be ""redeemed"", but one can ask oneself the question whether it is worth trying with the tough ones. We can therefore not speak of rehabilitation for all the criminals (even though, for certain persons, there are no desperate cases).
What I would particularly like to stress is the major role played by society as a whole in the process of rehabilitation; and it is not always a positive role. The main idea of this process is to reintegrate the individuals who have misconducted themselves into the society from which they originate. This means giving them responsabilities and rights again, a new job, ...; and this is not always seen favourably by the other members of this society. The latter are reluctant to employ them, to give them jobs with financial or moral responsabilities. They do not trust these people whom they treat as dirt, and whose right place, they think, is in jail.
This way of thinking is, together with the potential unwillingness of the criminals, the major reason why, I think, rehabilitation is idealistic.
Even when the ex-criminals are positively disposed, when they think they can be forgiven for what they have done, even when they want it, the black ""moral"" eye of society falls upon them. The result is that they do not see why they should behave well in a society which reproves and rejects them. And thus they fall again on the wrong side of the hill, to use a simplistic metaphore.
Those who were still more or less honest may become real rebels. But one might say that they can become rebels in prison too.
As for the tough criminals, they would take even less time to turn their back again.
As it must have become clear to you, I am not really convinced of the efficiency of the rehabilitation system, although I must recognize that it can work in some cases, and that it is a praiseworthy alternative. I agree that our prison system is outdated, or not appropriate, but rehabilitation is far from being the solution to all the problems.

Everyday we are informed about children starving to death, about countries torn by civil war, about hopeless human beings escaping from reality through death, about old people abandoned by the whole society and about lots more of such catastrophes.
First of all, how can we say that everybody is equal? I think that this is only written in a small paragraph which is lost among piles of sheets. Indeed we have only to look around us to see that we are not equal. Just take a look at the news: in Somalia, children are starving to death while soldiers of different ethnic groups plunder the food sent by the international aid; in ex-Yugoslavia, people who used to live in harmony just kill each others because they do not belong to the same race or religion; everywhere in the world, people are emprisoned and tortured because they do not share their government's opinions, ... In the meantime, we are sitting in comfortable chairs, sipping a coca-cola or a gin-tonic and watching those people suffer. Is it really fair?
And there is more to come! When you go for a walk, just look at people's faces. Just look at them! What do you see? You see a young man's face with a bright smile. Then, it is a girl of perhaps fifteen years old who attracts your attention: she is daydreaming. An old man, sitting on a bench, is talking to himself, or rather, he seems to be talking to his hands but when you come along, you hear him whispering:  and nobody stops, not even you. You also see a beggar, just holding out his hands but who does not dare to look at you. You see couples, young and old, loving each other or not, dressed with suits or with faded jeans. All the people that you will see are different, they have different social backgrounds, different family's histories, different friends and even different ways of living. Some are rich, others are poor. Some work fourteen hours a day, others are unemployed. Some are white, others are black. Some dwell in beautiful houses surrounded by marvellous gardens where children can play hide-and-seek, others live in teeny flats in dark areas where children can only play in the streets. Do you still think that we are equal?
Well, once you have understood and accepted that everybody is not equal, you just have to live with this certitude. The problem is that you cannot do much to change the situation. At a personal level, you can try to reorganize your perception of the world. Within a family, you can make an attempt in being right with every members although it is not always easy. If you have difficulties to realize this at a personal level, how can you expect it to be different on a world scale?
Inequality has been existing since the beginning of humanity. It is never too late to begin to transform society, but, to achieve results, you first have to metamorphose most of men into good-hearted human beings.

FRUB2022,3.0,4.0,,,,,Most university degrees are theoretical and do not prepare students for the real world. They are therefore of very little value,"
To begin I would like to concentrate on the first part of the affirmation: ""Most university degrees are theoretical and do not prepare students for the real world. It is in fact true that most of the courses are reduced to theories and only a few hours (or none at all) are left for practice. So for example in the studies of modern languages such as English, Dutch, German, ... there is no point to study the life of a writer in detail and to learn by heart all the titles of his works if, first of all, you are not able to communicate clearly your ideas. Of course when you choose to study language at the university you are supposed to master a basic vocabulary and be able to express yourself correctly. That is how it should be! It cannot be denied that students, studying language, are in general interested in literature, which is a theoretical subject. Where does the problem lie? Actually when you arrive at university you are a bit lost in front of all the books and course notes you will have not only to read, to analyse but also to comment on at the oral exam. All the year long you had to listen, to write and at the end of the year you have to speak. At this moment you realize that university is theoretical but that it was not very different in secondary school. Teachers obliged the students to learn long lists of words with their translations but they never or rarely asked students to use these words in a conversation.
The different courses students attend to become teacher are another example which illustrates the theoretical aspect of university. As a matter of fact it is very different to learn various pedagogical methods and to be in front of twenty pupils who are most of the time making fun of you. University will not tell you how to react; maybe you will be given some advice but in class you will be alone.
Now I would like to concentrate on the second part of the affirmation:  The word value has to be defined. Indeed we can explain the word from different points of view. For a student a degree is the proof that he has acquired a certain amount of knowledge about a precise subject although, as I have suggested before, it does not prove the student's ability to react ""correctly"" in society and everyday life.
From the point of view of society the meaning of ""value"" changes. Do they consider the degrees of little value? According to me the answer is parodoxical. On the one hand it is difficult to find a good job when you have no degree, so you are tempted to say that a degree has value but on the other hand you constantly hear the same repproach namely:  This only confirms the idea that university, but also studies in general, do not prepare young people to enter the ""real"" world, where they will have to face a lot of problems they were never confronted with before.
As a conclusion I would say that we cannot deny the fact that university degrees are more theoretical than practical but I think that it is too easy to deduce that degrees are of little value. In my opinion a degree remains the indispensable key to find a good job. Ik think also that it is our job to fill the gaps and to practise what we have learned. The only way to acquire practice is to practise!

FRUB2024,3.0,3.0,,,,,Most university degrees are theoretical and do not prepare students for the real world. They are therefore of very little value,"
It is very often said that most university degrees are theoretical and do not prepare students actively for the real world. They are therefore considered of being of very little value for the student. And yet, university studies are neither becoming less popular nor does its success decline on any account. On the contrary, we live in a society in which university titles are more and more considered as necessary if not required in order to enter the real and fascinating professional world. We therefore find ourselves in front of a somewhat ambiguous and even paradoxical situation, involving a very complex and nonetheless crucial choice, which could be restated following: Do university degrees really prepare us for the real professional world or is it preferable to opt for a more practical type of formation? This basic question is worth closer examination.
On the one hand, university studies essentially consist of the teaching of theoretical material and are mainly based on theory rather than dealing with practical experience. But one has first to consider that the very definition of university studies -if there were one- would automatically imply the learning of a subject on a theoretical ground. The process of learning itself inevitably consists of the study of theoretical points, whether in a scientific or in a more literary field. Knowledge has to be acquired through the manipulation of theories, ideas and concepts, and the very basis of each type of studies is undeniably anchored within books and manuals. The university system is and has always been centred on the development and perpetuation of theories and postulates and its teaching methods, as a result, are also based on theories. Besides this, it is only towards the middle of the twentieth century that private institutions slowly begin to emerge, with the principal aim of proposing to the student a shorter and more specialized formation together with more active and practical programs and methods of teaching. This particular type of studies is today very much attended to by students preferring to follow a more practical program essentially based on active or passive stages, favorizing then perhaps more easily the student's future professional insertion. This clearly depends very much on the student's own aspirations and, of course, on the type of studies chosen: it is obvious that one cannot study mathematics without having to deal first theoretically with theorems and formulas.
On the other hand, it must be considered that both university and other practical or specialized types of studies do not make more than preparing the student to the real professional world. Both are offering him a particular background formation -whether theoretical or more active-, and this only prepares him ""intellectually"" to his future professional occupation. For my part, as I have already underlined it before, I think that the very act of studying implies the learning of theories and that university studies have as great a value as other shorter and more practical types of studies. Once he has assimilated a certain amount of theoretical knowledge, I think that it depends totally on the student himself to complete as effectively as possible this theoretical background formation that has been offered to him, or in other words, to bring this ""passive"" knowledge into practice by means of an active exercise of his art.
To conlude with, I think that, just as one really learns to drive only after having passed his driving licence, each one has to externalise in his own way the amount of theoretical information he has been piling up during all these long years of studies and to bring it to a successful conclusion, once having reached the stage of beginning a professional career. All this, simply because we cannot teach someone real life. Real life is experienced but not studied.

FRUB2026,2.5,2.0,,,,,"Some people say that in our modern world, dominated by science and technology and industrialisation, there is no longer a place for dreaming and imagination. What is your opinion?","
During the last two centuries, man has been the witness of a vertiginous development in the fields of technology, of science and industrialisation. Even without taking the distance usually necessary to the valuation of an historical epoch, it is easy to conclude that in two centuries man has done more than in the last millennium.
There are several factors that brought to this sudden acceleration in scientific and technological evolution, but I think that the main one to be taken into account is the fact that man has direct his effort toward communication, favouring what has been also called ""the pooling of knowledge"": human beings, ""instead of remainging helpless because of the limitations of their own experience and knowledge ... can go on from where others left off"". Certainly, this implies the fact that man finds himself suddenly attacked by stimuli and informations coming from any side, and to which he cannot remain indifferent, since we have to admit that ignorance, once considered an evil due to the impossibility of having access to the instruments of knowledge, is nowadays considered as capital sin, and is therefore unforgivable.
All this means that man, in order not to neglect those stimuli coming from the external world, often forgets his ""baby-ego"" (that, luckily, usually does not disappear, even if it is tained by time and limited in its expression). This means that man neglects that mental activity that makes him so different from the other living beings: the activity of dreaming, the faculty of imagination.
From an historical and literal point of view, the first who suffered from it and who reacted against it in an explicit way have been the Romantics, who set themselves against the spread of industrialisation (specially in Great Britain) and the consequent modernization of life.
They aspired to a return to natural life, since their opinion was that only being in contact with nature man can keep alive that faculty that allows the elaboration of the highest expression of imagination: poetry.
In fact, according to them (and more precisely, to the two great English Romantics Wordsworth and Coleridge), the poet is a man specially endowed with ""that synthetic and magical power [named] imagination"" and who is able to express it thanks to his special sensibility to the language spoken by nature.
Now, I think that the fact that some people are led to think that there is no longer place for dreaming and imagination is due to the fact that science and technology nowadays provide us with an answer to any question or doubt, and almost no room is left to personal imagination, to assumptions, to conjectures.
Science and technology have in fact taken the place that once belonged to the world of the irrational, and give nowadays, with great ease, answers to questions that for years (and even centuries) have been the source of doubts and fears, or simply of mythology and legends; in short, of all that belongs to the domain of imagination.
However, we do not have to forget that, if it is true that man has already got over that epoch compared by the Romantics to the childhood (a period in which rationality has no grip on imagination) it is also true that he has not needed so much time to realize it, and to reach that state in which, as in one's full maturity of years, one looks back with regret on such a thoughtless period.

At the dawn of the second millennium, technological progress and scientific discoveries are something most of people have become blas about. The rapid pace of industrial change has led to a society managed by stress, worries and speed. The modernization of the world prevents us from taking any initiative or even from being enthousiastic about our lives. People therefore claim that dreaming and imagination no longer have their place in our society. But I think that this assertion is to be disputed.
Dreams and images are the only means of escaping from the unpleasant and dull reality of life. Sociologists and psychologists assign them a considerable importance and a sustained attention because they are essential elements of the blooming and the equilibrium of the individual. Looking around us only for a while, we will realize and understand that, at any moment, we are confronted with pictures, sounds and smells which already stretch our imagination. Advertisements promise us fabulous products, travel agencies invite us to paradisiacal places, songs on the radio awake some tender memories and a sweet perfume evokes the warmth and the calm of exotic countries. There is absolutely no doubt about this: imagination is still an important feature of our life and an indispensable key to happiness.
As far as dreams are concerned, the same could be said. They can't be dissociated from life, from society nor even from the world. What would life be without dreams? What meaning, what sense would it have? What would be the essence of humanity if no dream was allowed? People, since the beginning of civilization and till the end of times, have always and will always have dreams. People have always tried to make them real, have fought in their names and hoped in them.
Dreams can also be regarded as the engine of society. They are indeed the propulsive forces that make technological or scientific progress and advance possible. What would have happened if somebody hadn't once dreamt of flying in the air? The airplane would probably still be unknown to us. What would have happened if somebody hadn't thought of a telephone? Communication would still encounter some difficulties. It would be almost impossible to write an exhaustive list of this phenomenon but it may nevertheless be accepted as a general characteristic: men's inventions and creations have always been preceded by the dream of them. In a few words we can say that dreams are necessary to the world evolution and consequently they are also desirable for men's psychological development. They, indeed, need to believe in something, need to have some ideals to pursue in order to become well-balanced individuals.
So as I tried to show in my essay, dreams and imagination still have a crucial place in our life. Even and maybe even more in a modern world, dominated by technology, science and industrialisation, people, at times, need to find an escape and a refuge from reality, in a secret and mysterious garden where they can give free rein to their imagination and to their dreams... the only way to forget the depressing and exhausting world we live in.

FRUB2028,1.0,2.0,,,,,Feminists have done more harm to the cause of women than good,"
By advocating women's rights on the ground of the equality of the sexes, feminists do not always realize that such a theory may have in certain cases negative consequences on women's way of life. Obviously feminism was first based on good intentions towards women. Some laws, applied exclusively to them, such as the interdiction for women to vote till the beginning of this century, was to be prohibited and that is the reason why the feminist movement appeared. Some positive changes in women's life may be regarded as consequences of feminism: they have acquired the freedom of speech, they have reached a social status, which in most cases is equivalent to that of the men. But according to me the movement grew with more and more demands that lies today beyond its competence. Nowadays what feminists are claiming does not make the task easier for women. The members of the movement want the total equality of men and women, but it does not seem possible in a society where some roles are attributed to men and other ones to women. It is however true that in today's world women need more and more remunerations, and whatever feminists will say it is because of financial difficulties rather than in order to assert themselves in front of men. The real problem is to be found in the fact that women who wish to have a job, also desire to have a family life. The multifariousness of duties does not give any rest to modern women who have to live on their nerves. Women who may conciliate professional and family duties are for most of them impeded in their social progression while this is not the case with men. These latter may devote their whole time and energy to the job they are involved in. So the equality may not be reached so long as family tasks are not adequately divided between wife and husband. From another point of view, I think that women must accept that some fundamental (social) differences exist between men and women. As far as jobs are concerned, it is quite clear that some of them are not intended to women, because for instance too much physical qualities are needed. Such a realistic idea will be repudiated by feminists who deny any role determined by natural laws. In opposition to this desire to equality between the sexes, a lot of women secretly or openly hope to maintain traditional values in their private life and aknowledge feminine attribution such as maternity and specific behaviour. Feminists have to accept to be treated as men if they defend their theory. In that case men-to-women relationship in everyday life may not be different from the relationship between men, otherwise the feminists' demanding are meaningless. Feminists always think of inferiority when somebody speaks of differences between men and women, but I think that these distinctions are due to natural laws and feminists should assert themselves by emphasizing their differences instead of trying to be equal to men.

That's true. Today's world has become impersonal and almost unhuman. Everywhere you go, you've got the same picture: people running to work, getting the bus, the tram, the metro, the train, the plane, ..., coming home, picking the kids at school, cooking dinner, arguing, yelling at each other, breaking a few plates, crying a bit, and finally falling asleep, frustrated, sad and lonely, lonely in their own house, lonely together.
People act like robots, people sometimes have no choice though. Money, the need of money pushes everyone to get up every morning and to work for half of their lives. A trip to Mexico? A few weeks on a desert island? Well. if it's desert in the first place, that's because nobody can afford to live there forever. Life is sad because people can't afford to live anymore, they can't afford to take some time off, can they afford to be happy?
Aren't we all bound to suffer from nervous breakdowns, from solitude, from overwork, from lack of time, lack of understanding, lack of love, lack of dreams? Or am I generalizing? Are you happy? Do you still have time to walk in a field in the summer, to look around and hear no cars, no trams, no alarms going off, no hunks, just the bird singing? Do you still have time to dream? Or are your dreams haunted with numbers -if you're an accountant-, with spoiled and bratty students -if you're a teacher-, with sick and dying people -if you're a doctor-, or with mean and unsensitive teachers -if you're a poor student like me-?
Do you have time to dream, to fly away just a few minutes while staring out from your office window? And what about expressing your dreams? Painting, writing, singing, dancing, acting; actualizing, realizing your dreams. To create, to use one's most personal power, one's ""private garden"", one's imagination. And recreate everything, reshape the world according to your own little inside world. I couldn't live without my dreams, without my diary, my poems, even though they're clumsy, so innocent probably, so naive, but at least they're part of me, they are my very soul. People tend to become so material, so superficial; they're afraid to share, to share their lives, their money, their feelings. They're afraid to get hurt. Yet they all have their ""private garden"", hidden somewhere; they all have a soul - and a heart.
So why not let them tell us more about it? Why not try to forget the boredom of our lives and look on the bright side? We should all explore our personal treasures of imagination, of dreams and learn to share them with others. Learn to listen to each other, to talk instead of yell, learn to create our own desert islands in our minds, and to make them accessible to the others, to our relatives, our friends.
That way, we won't be feeling so frustrated anymore, at least, our lives will have a meaning; to create and to share, to give and to receive, to love and to be loved in return ...

During the nineteenth century, countries such as France, Belgium, North America or England witnessed the rise of industrialization, an industrialization that went hand-in-hand with great technological progress and inventions. The new interest people had in science and in technology engendered a real change in the mentalities. As firms, factories and research laboratories spread and sprang up like mushrooms all over the world, society became a thread of trade exchanges and business relations. More and more people devoted their existence to science, trying to discover new means of communication or to improve their own comfort.
Industrialization, science and technology gave man the opportunity to change his life and even the lot of humanity.
Progress, however, meant also more pollution, rural depopulation and stikes that affected the world. Though one cannot deny the fact that scientific as well as technolotgical progress made life easier and more comfortable, one may sometimes wonder if this progress did not imply the loss of values such as love, generosity and faith. I think that people have neglected the essential, namely to dream. By devoting all his energy to technology, man has lost his capacity to create and to imagine.
Nowadays, we are deeply rooted in the technological era, which is the era of the computer. In this modern world where everything gravitates around science, where nothing is left to chance, there is little place for imagination. Man has become some sort of ""preconditionned worker"" who is constantly told to be perfect. The pragmatic character of this era has overthroned romanticism. We belong to some sort of computerized world in which usefulness and efficiency are considered to be the key-concepts necessary to succeed in life. Even worse, people are often told to despise the 'imperfect', the 'eccentric', in short, society teaches them to reject the difference. Technology and progress have overwhelmed that difference that makes life's richness. People are so absorbed by modern life that they remain pragmatic and so involved in the triviality and the monotony of their daily existence that they have lost all the fantasy necessary to dream. Imagination may be seen as the only means to 'survive' in the jungle of modern life.
There are fortunately still people whose aim is to make us dream and meditate. These men and women are called artists, and usually spend their lives entertaining other people.
Painters as well as poets or musicians devote their time to beauty, to fantasy, but not to science or technology. From this point of view, art seems to be the only way of preventing man to become completely obsessed by progress. Science has in a way made man lazy and even unimaginative, reducing him to some kind of machine destined to reach perfection. Personally, I hope that the world will never be like Huxley's Brave New World, a world in which imagination and fantasy have been eradicated for the sake of progress.

There is no longer a place for dreaming and imagination in our modern world, which is dominated by science, technology and industrialisation. But why does this relationship between the modern world and the impossibility of dreaming exist? Some people may argue that those who are involved in the world of technology and industrialisation, namely businessmen and manufacturers, do not need to escape their world of power through dream because they are thoroughly satisfied with it.
However, even if this presupposition is acceptable, why are then so many of them obliged to leave out their job because of nervous breakdown?
This question underlines the root of the problem. Most of the people do not even realize that our modern society encloses them in a world of stress and agitation, leaving them no time and no place for dreaming and imagination. These people behave out of sheer habit and are not aware of it.
But why do they not perceive this lack of dream and imagination? Its origin is to find back in their 'bad' education. At school, they were not taught the necessity and the important place dreaming and imagining should take. They were even not taught what poetry was? Their poetical sensibility has not been developed so that now they favour a world of power and economy. This can be a reason fro the disappearance of dreaming and imagination in our modern society.
However, education can not be considered as the only cause of such a relationship. A second, and more probable, reason is the effect of new technology and industrialisation on our society. Many workers, after working eight to ten hours in an enterprise, are too tired to dream and imagine fantastic adventures. They are too busy with their job, which agitates them during the day so that they are exhausted when coming at home in the evening.
But fortunately not everybody have such an behaviour. When coming back from a hard working day some people will still have the time to rest in their garden and listen to nature. It gives them the opportunity to have a nice dream, or to think of all that is pleasant and good in life. This is a way of relaxing, of enjoying life, of considering the good and the bad part of life. Our imagination is something that is personal and that noone nor nothing, even industrialisation, is able to take away from us. Through imagination we escape the everyday reality. This is also a way of taking energy to be in extremely good conditions to start a new day.
As conclusion, we could say that everyone is free to spend some time dreaming or not. Anyway we cannot affirm it is the absolute fault of industrialisation and technology if someone has no time to dream but it is true that it has strongly influenced our society and its people.

During the twentieth century our world has reached a degree of civilization which is often claimed to be the highest in the history of mankind. Very sophisticated devices are supposed to bring us happiness. This process was more or less established two centuries ago and it has not stop accelerating since the beginning of the nineteenth century when industrial revolution completely changed what was, until then, seen as the traditional way of life. This means that agriculture had to give precedence to industry and technology. It did not imply however a complete giving up of contacts with nature but a belief in the solving of all problems by purely technological means appeared. In this respect, people often saw industrialization as the definitive victory of culture over nature.
With all this in mind it is no wonder that less attention was paid to nature. The reason for this is obvious: man had for centuries had to struggle for his life and this had often turned to his disadvantage. Towards the end of the eighteenth century, industry, technology and science were seen as the long-awaited solution. In fact, the idea of endless progress is rooted in the ideals of this period. Then, as soon as technoscience became efficacious there was no more need to worry about nature which has so often deceived man.
In 1992 we may consider that our predecessors showed too great an optimism. Surely the living conditions have been improved but new problems such as overpopulation, underdevelopment ...
on the one hand, overconsumption and wasting on the other, did not fail to come up. People are now witnessing the worst difficulties modern science has in tackling those questions.
Furthermore, one may actually doubt whether greater wealth automatically leads to more happiness. All this would explain why after years of denigration and disparagement, people seem to rediscover the advantages nature offers. A little example will illustrate this: at present it is striking to see how more and more people carefully select what they eat or drink.
They really want to take ""pieces of nature"" rather than to swallow chemicals. One must however remain aware that seeing nature as the panacea will certainly not solve everything.
There is also no point in going back to the Stone Age or to some kind of bygone days. Anyway, a solid amount of realism will be required here. There are many cultural elements which are impossible to be done away with. Both nature and culture must be taken into account in order to find the suitable improvements that will make the planet Earth fitter to live in.

To what extent does science lull the imagination and what is the place of dream and imagination in our world?
One aim of science is to offer a world without danger, without accidents, as comfortable as possible. A world where the practical comes before beauty, survival before life. The result is that people are becoming lazy. They live for the day and accept what has been thought for them. This laziness is reinforced by television, which proposes to live ""by proxy"".
Added to that the requirements of modern life do not give much time to think and observe the world.
To achieve this aim, scientists must explain and understand everything. There is not much mystery left and mystery stirs phantasy. In fact, the three aspects of life which most arouse dream and imagination: nature, love (true love) and religion are gradually dying out because of a too scientific mentality.
The will to dominate nature, for example, corresponds to a will to dominate our instincts and the more secret part of our personality. It is regrettable because nature is full of life, love and beauty. It tells something about our origin, stirs all kinds of emotion and can even be for some people a proof of the existence of God.
Love and religion have been the subject for many passionate writings and works of art as well.
People are abandoning religion partly because it is irrational and it gives scruples.
As for love, it seems that most people seek more a successful career than true love. In short, we live in an atmosphere which is not favourable to art and sentiments. This mentality is spread by education. Children are taught to have a limitless admiration for the progress of science and later, to strive for the best jobs, which can bring them money and prestige. They are thaught that art is secondary and are rarely asked to show their imagination in poetry or to develop artistic gifts.
On the other hand, imagination and dreams are a matter of personality and inner life. Nothing can prevent a dreamer from dreaming. But these faculties must remain personal, they are not taken seriously because mathematical intelligence is considered superior to intuitive intelligence.
One may argue that there are still artists and writers, that many artistic events & exhibitions are still organized, but we don't know how many people are interested in them and whether the interest is deep or shallow.
To sum up, if there is still a little place for dreaming and imagination in our world, it is because some people refuse to be dominated by science, technology and industrialization.

The twentieth century may be called the ""age of technology, science and industrialization"", and that for a few reasons.
First of all, the progress made by science, and particularly in medicine are fantastic. Just consider the case of cancerology or genetics: nearly every woman now can be pregnant even if the husband is impotent. Secondly, the technologists have invented a lot of things to improve our everyday life, such as cars, washing machines, the central heating, credit cards, computers, etc. This new ""age"" is certainly a great one. However, we may ask ourselves whether in our modern world, there is still a place for dreaming and imagination.
A few years ago both George Orwell in his novel 1984 and Aldous Huxley in Brave New World already imagined how life would become in a world completely dominated by science: only those who remained ignorant or those who managed to forget what love was could survive! How terrific it would be if this was also our common destiny!
In spite of the real danger that there is in going on to invent new machineries such a television without thinking a bit further about it, I am quite sure that life would be impossible if the man stopped dreaming and imagining. Moreover we often heard that a man who had stopped dreaming was a dead one! Furthermore I precisely think that dream has stimulated or made a lot of technological progresses possible. If man once flew to the moon in a rocket, it is because he had first dreamt about space and imagined how life could be up there.
On the other hand, dream and imagination are also part of our everyday life. Have you never opened a newspaper without any advertisement about looking younger, or about a journey to a sunny country? Literature and cinema also entertain our dreaming by  telling us wonderful stories about a knight on a white horse who comes and delivers the beautiful princess or about life in the future like in Spielberg's movie Back to the future. To stop dreaming can also be understood in a figurative way as to give up hope. Dream has indeed always been a mean to escape reality and all the problems such as war, the end of  a love story, poverty, etc., we have to face.
In conclusion, I would simply like to say  those who pretend that there is no longer place for dreaming and imagination in our modern world that life only remains bearable because of that. Dream and imagination are simply there to counterbalance the bad sides of the scientific world.

Some people say that in our modern world, dominated by science, technology and industrialisation, there is no longer a place for dreaming and imagination.
First, let us examine this definition of our world, and add some further explanation to it. Our world is characterized by the development of science and technology; it is dominated by the industrialisation process. Workers at every level are involved in this system, which above all aims at productivity.
At first sight one might say that obviously people are not expected to be creative, but rather, efficient. The production line work is a very good example of this, even if it describes an extreme situation. However, considering that only example would mean ignoring the fact that there are creative professions, such as novelist, artist and research workers, that require imagination rather than productivity.
The progress that has been brought by the scientific development, has deeply changed the face of society: the standard of living has risen so that a certain welfare is now extending to the majority of people.
Altogether, our present situation does not apparently favour the life of the spirit.
However, a closer look at the various elements in society will show that there may be a place for dreaming and imagination in science and industrialisation.
Modern science has brought new questions, it is continuously pushing back the frontiers of knowledge, so it invites man to use his mind and try to imagine the life of tomorrow. Science fiction is a very good example of this: it shows that science and imagination are not irreconcilable.
Similarly, industrialisation does not apparently favour the imagination, so the modern man, who is involved in the production process, feels the need for dreaming. Industries are now faced with the need to give people more freedom: evidence of this can be seen in the creation of the socalled ""cercles de qualit"" where the employees are invited to express their own ideas and discuss them together.
Moreover, the development of technology has made a double progress simultaneously possible: it has reduced the working time and raise the productivity. The effect produced is double: first, the growing welfare of people, second, the expanse of the socalled ""leisure time"".
Though one could have thought that technology had made man more creative by giving him more leisure time, this does not quite happen that way. People, as they live in a society based on production and consumption, see their lives also in terms of consumption, they have become less free, less creative.
Their present welfare represents a potential risk for the loss of personality; this can be seen in the growing, often negative influence of television, which sometimes leads to passivity and carelessness. Conversely, leisure time can be most enriching to man, if only he uses it to express himself and state his difference.
Therefore, it is reasonable to say that, even in a highly advanced society as ours, imagination and dreaming are still - if not always - at work in professional life; as for the private life, it only depends on man's ability and desire to break with the general atmosphere.

If you ask a child what his plans are for the coming holidays, he will no doubt select activities such as watching the television or playing with the computer. This is very convenient for parents. On one hand, if they are not at home, these ""games"" can easily take place at Granny's home or at the baby-sitter's. On the other hand, if they are present, little time has to be devoted to organize these so-called leisure!
Moreover, the television programmes children choose are not always the best ones. The most striking examples are cartoons.
How can you expect a child to have or to develop imagination from a pseudo science-fictional background? T-V. programmes also become as uninteresting as repetitions.
As opposed to that, nature and literature are an unexhaustible source of dreams and imagination. Few children however are still interested in long walks through woods and fewer are in the reading of novels or poems. This lack of interest is certainly one of the fundamental reason of this ""imaginational breakdown"".
Another collapsing pillar of the imagination and dreaming is adventure. The increasing package tours clearly shows that people do not seek adventure anymore. Some parents consider their holidays as a big baby-sitting party. Subscribing to such trips, they know that activities will be organized for their children as well as for themselves. They are advised not to worry, enjoy themselves and spend as much money as they can. Can such organization, uniformity and idleness really lead to the imagination's development?
Furthermore, the golden motto is ""enjoy yourself EFFORTLESSLY"". Why then would one face a difficulty when it is so convenient to turn one's back to it? Children only think in terms of effort if there is a reward, and not any reward, a material one if possible. They are not taught to open their eyes, ears and nose. They do not not enjoy looking at nature because they do not see, hear or smell it. That problem has to be dealt with by educational means. The best method is to teach ourselves first.
Every adult is a teacher who has to set an example to children. Being models, grown-ups are constantly imitated by children. If the latter lack imagination, so do the former.
Some people think that reality is built up on science, technology, and industrialisation. On the contrary, if our society is not decadent yet, it is due to people gifted with dreaming and imagination powers: They are not only concerned by production, uniformity and organization; humour, fantasy, literature and adventure are certainly as important for them.
They can still be struck with amazement. Is that true for children? I doubt it. They think every technological achievement is obvious, and financial consequences seem to be the companies' main concerns.
This estonishment being rare, I wonder where people still find pleasure, certainly not in bringing up children! If the next generations do not tackle these problems seriously, some more steps will have been taken towards a real Brave New World.

FRUC3048,3.0,3.0,,,,,The prison system is outdated. No civilized society should punish its criminals: it should rehabilitate them,"
20th April 1992, Mr Dean is free. He has spent twenty years in prison for committing several armed robberies. Mr Dean is now roaming through his native town which he used to know very well twenty years ago. But everything has changed and he does not know where to go...
Such a story could be true since many prisoners are freed after spending quite a long time in prison are supposed to start a new life in a completely new society. But is it really possible for them to rehabilitate in society? I do not think it is. Twenty years are enough for the world to change so much that it is hardly recognizable. And it is not easy for those who have spent a long time in prison to readapt to a new world. On the contrary, they often used to live on the fringe of society when they were sent in prison. Indeed, many crimes (in the broad sense of the term) are a kind of protest against society. Many robbers or criminals do not act in such a way because they are basically bad people but rather because they are at odds with themselves. Nobody likes killing other people unless he is raving mad. Then he ought to be locked up in a psychiatric hospital. So, why do we continue to send so many people to prison as it does them more harm than good?
Well, man has always wanted to get rid of riffraff, which is understandable. The ""an eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth"" law prevailing many years ago, has been replaced by a new law: whoever commits a crime has to be punished and, if necessary, sent to prison. No society has ever accepted lost people, while precisely more attention should be paid to them.
We send robbers and criminals to prison where they become more violent and still more disorientated. But what else could we do?
One solution might be to help them to readapt to society.
Most of the criminals, rapists or hooligans are definitely people who need affection. They have seldom a very enviable domestic situation, if they have one at last! Therefore, instead of plunging them further into loneliness, it would be far better to help them. They need to feel useful and important in society. We could (or should?) therefore give them a chance to work, to earn money (a part of which they should possibly give back to repair the harm they have done).
We could give them the jobs which nobody wants to do. But be careful: these men are not slaves! On the contrary, they have to be given responsabilities and opportunities to be promoted, so that they can have quite a normal life. Of course, it would cost money but it would also empty the overcrowded prisons and be a far better solution for the prisoners themselves.
Moreover, new jobs could be created to allow several persons to help these men. The number of crimes would certainly diminish rapidly. In other words, we would live in a far better society. Maybe it is only an utopia, but maybe it is worth trying. So, what are we waiting for?

Some people say that in our modern world dominated by science technology and industrialisation, there is no longer a place for dreaming and imagination.

To those who have shed tears in silence while the world was growing up with violence.
To those who have kept dreaming and hoping while indifference and intolerance were singing.

In a world where money is almost the root of all evil, where even the simplest dream of a better world is laughed at, one has to find reasons to keep one fighting those ill-founded fears about life.
Most of us are lost in a world where failure is not any more considered as a positive experience, allowing one to find one's way in life. We have forgotten that the best things in life are free, that dreams can enable people to achieve great things, that fantasy can help us to create a world full of joyful moments, enabling us therefore to take life easy and find serenity.
But in a world of stone people live their lives like candles in the wind, never knowing who to turn to when problems arise; because all their life they worked harder and harder in order to get richer, deserting by the same time family and friends.
Finally left on their own with no stars shining in their eyes any more for ""Time and tide wait for no man"", they realise that life loses its meaning once one is deprived of one's ideals and dreams.
Paradoxical though it may seem, technology was conceived to allow people to devote their time to leisure and culture.
But, although it should have been to man's advantage, it was of benefit to technology itself. Indeed whereas man doesn't work less harder than he used to, the industry produces more.
All this goes to show that somehow wealth corrupts.
Science technology and industrialisation must not dominate our world, it should only help us to build a better world, in which life would be worth living. In other words technology should be at man's service, rather than man at technology's service.
We live in a world in which the idea of getting rich (if possible) without too much effort has universal appeal.
Reality however is very different. Nowadays, people want to lead a comfortable existence. The other side of the coin is however that people have to work increasingly harder.
Consequently the time left is too short to allow people to fantasize about their life.
Nevertheless it should not be forgotten that man is the master of his own destiny.
Even though events may shape our destiny, we should never let neither technology nor science hold our future in its power.

When people heard last year that military service would be abolished in 1994 in Belgium, a great debate started between supporters and opponents of the military service. But what kind of arguments do people use to defend their point of view?
To begin with, it should be said that most people are in favour of its abolition: young men, but also their parents, girlfriends or wifes, and freethinkers of different leanings.
There have never been so many people declared unfit for service in Belgian history as the last couple of years. And what is more, the state does not seem to bother too much about it. It is true that if military service is abolished, it will be mainly so because of its expensiveness. One would believe it! If the most interesting thing soldiers have to do is shooting bullets at a target as long as there is ammuniton, driving tanks or lorries for miles and miles without any objective... when millions of people are starving every day, then we might think that something has to be done about it.
Servicemen are badly paid, waste their time and forget during one year what they had learned at school, if they do not lose their jobs. It is not what one might call a very positive protrayal of the matter!
What do the supporters of the service reply? That the only way to protect people in case of war is to have a very strong army. The many wars around the world seem to confirm their point of view.
It is certainly true but with the money that all the servicemen ""cost"" to the state(!), new professional soldiers could be engaged. And all of them could be better trained so as to be useful in every kind of conflicts. It is really a lack of common sense to think that servicemen would be able to defend their country if necessary. They are maybe trained for that but there is no possible comparison between ""theory"" and ""practice"" during a war! People who are in the army because they have to are certainly not ready to kill anyone for a political ideal.
But if military service is to be abolished in Belgium (because the law has not yet been passed!) and afterwards in the EEC, should it then be replaced by a kind of non-military service? It could be a good idea to help people in need, I am thinking of old people or handicaped persons, or to try to diminish criminality in some districts with regular patrols.
The main problem is that those people in service would take the place of workers, and so there could be even more unemployment. and what about the question of girls? Would they also have to do it?
It is obvious that dicators like Saddam Hussein will not give up their ""dreams"" of conquering other territories, and that we should be able to protect their victims. But a democratic country should not involve people who do not want and are not ready or trained to fight in a war.

FRUC3054,2.0,2.5,,,,,Crime does not pay,"
We usually distinguish a human being from an animal by saying that the former is intelligent and that the latter reacts instinctively. The first is able to think whereas the second can not. But this does not mean that human beings are good creatures and animals bad ones. On the contrary, animals never hurt each other deliberately. They can not think about doing harm. Of course they may be cruel towards each other.
But then it is just for the sake of survival. In other words it is natural. Here lies, in my opinion, another major difference between these two worlds.
As far as the human world is concerned a distinction between what is right and what is wrong has to be made. People are good but can also have negative feelings and reactions.
This ambiguity, inherent to the human race, leads some persons to become criminals. Generally speaking, criminals may be seen as people who transgress the law in order to fulfil their wishes. There are several ways of violating the law and therefore various kinds of criminals. The reasons bringing an individual to act like this are numerous too. It can be a matter of education (parents taking too little care of their children), of social background (poverty, hunger, drug, ...)
or of mental disorder. A man (or woman) who has grown up in a working-class district and who has never learned to work because his parents had not put him at school stands a great chance to become a criminal. He will be tempted to steal money in order to eat. This will appear to him as his last chance.
And that is the mistake most people do before committing a crime: they think this is the only way of escape. They have become so miserable that they have to find something which could recue them. They have reached a stage where the situation is no longer bearable. This moment is a crucial one, because people make an important choice there. They are at a kind of branch: either they decide to look for a job, or they plan to steal money. The second solution seems easier than the first one and much more beneficial. But all this is just an illusion. In a way, criminals are blind people who do not realize the seriousness of the situation. They are missionaries lost in the desert, dying of thirst, running towards an unexisting oasis. These criminals transgress the law in order to save themselves, in order to survive and improve their life. As such they may be considered as a first type of criminals.
Next to them we have mentally ill persons, living in their own world, with their own laws. These people do not hesitate to attack other persons without any particular reason. I am referring here to crimes such as rapes, murders, ...
These unbalanced persons reduce others to the state of mere objects. Some of them do not even realize how cruel their acts are. On the contrary, they claim they are good for humanity.
While others, who are conscious of their mental state, still keep on raping or killing! Why? Most of them do not even know!
In conclusion, one could say that there are several types of crimes, some being worse than others, even though a crime is never a proper thing. Whatever the kind of criminal is concerned, one thing is sure: a crime never forms a solution to the problems one may have in his life. Even if it looks like a liberation at first sight, it can just be harmful to humanity in general.
However one has to realize that as long as there will be men on earth, crime will remain a reality.
Crime is not a solution and there is no solution to crime.

It is often asserted than in our modern world, the world of new technology, people do no longer dream. People tend to believe that computers and robots have done much more harm than good. They say that man has no opportunity to dream or imagine and that he becomes a robot that can only obey the orders given by the machines. And, according to them, it would hardly be an exaggeration to say that man in the industrialised society is already dead because he has lost his faculty of thinking. It is certainly true that technology has taken a considerable place in man's life but it is questionable whether technology prevents man from dreaming and imaging. On the contrary, computer, with all its possibilities, enables the user to create new programmes, to adapt a former programme to his particular problem, to invent new electronic games... Let us remember that however performant a computer may be it will always remain a machine that needs man to be created and to function. In this way, technology leaves a place to man and imagination. Besides of this, when an ingeneer uses his minicalculator to solve any kind of problem he faces or when a housewife uses a mixer in her kitchen, technology enables them to gain time and the time they spare can be spent in daydreaming, drawing... But the very opposite may also be true: the time they spare can also be spent in watching T.V., in playing with the computers so that there is no place left to imagination. Some people may react in different ways when they feel they become slaves of technology. Some go to the country, buy a little farm and live as at the beginning of the century with animals and without T.V., radio or car. Other react less strongly and puts limits to the introduction of technology in their houses: they do not have any television set in their bedrooms and when they watch T.V., it is always an interesting programme. They often go out or spend time together in dreaming about their former or next holyday. A third group of reacting people is made of people who turn to mysticism or religious sects which promise a world of dream far from any technological ""contamination"". But though they think they are free, they are under the orders of the ""chief"" who wants everyone to think in one particular way, the ""right"" way and this is still more dangerous than being ""computer addicted"". In conclusion I would say that it is true that technology has an important place in man's life and that if he does not make good use of it, he may be the robot of technology, a robot wich does not think, nor dream, which simply does not live. But if technology is well managed it can be advantageous to man or at least less dangerous than the spiritual solutions wich aim at escaping it.

FRUC3059,3.0,3.0,,,,,"In his novel ""Animal Farm"" George Orwell wrote ""All men are equal but some are more equal than others"". How true is this today?","
For a long time, people have built societies in which men are not equal, in which two extremes are found: the superior, i.e. the king and the inferior, i.e. the slave. Every person wants to be the best and it is the same as with species: some grow, some remain small and some die. For a long time, Europeans have thought they were more equal than any other people. They killed and used as objects millions of ""savage niggers"" as they called them. But who were the actual savages?
In our twentieth century the human rights have been a subject matter on which governments, minorities, members of parliament, the Amnesty International organisation and many other people have focused. Too many injustices have been done to many people and are still done; it is why laws are needed in order to protect every human being.
Almost every person you meet will tell you that all men are equal and have the same rights. But if you are white, if you have money, if you are the daughter of a king, aren't you already more equal than others? All people are equal but when one's skin is light, one is already more equal, superior to the others.
Orwell could have written ""people"" instead of ""men"". One could blame him for making men more equal than women as he does not mention women. Men thought they were superior to women because they were born with more physical strenght and with the capacity to be violent. Wouldn't our patriarchal society have been different if women had been physically as strong as men?
One can be born more equal because one was born in a rich, European family. But what do we mean by ""equal""? The word equal also refers to a particular norm imposed by society. If one is more equal because of wealth it is because of our capitalistic-materialistic western society which imposes its own norms. The idea that people are equal and should have the same rights is growing but remains superficial because behind this idea hides a society in which you must be attractive, successful, kind and rich to be accepted.
One could also change Orwell's quotation and say: ""All men are equal but some are less equal than others"". If one was born in Third World country, in a poor family, with divorced parents or a with handicap, one is less equal than others.
""All men are equal up to the pub's terrace"" is the slogan of the 488100 charity performance which collects funds to help the handicapped people. When you are called ""handicapped"", it means you are not like the others. Our modern society finds it so difficult to welcome the ""Other"", the difference.
In conclusion, one could say that all men were created equal, but one's equality will depend on the place where one was born since our world has been divided in rich and poor, north and south, white and coloured, etc... The word ""equal"" also refers to a norm imposed by society which you have to obey to be welcome. It seems we are unable to consider or appreciate the Other's worth.

FRUC3060,3.0,2.5,,,,,All armies should consist entirely of professional soldiers: there is no value in a system of military service,"
The abolition of the compulsory military service is a current project in 1992 with which I completely agree as I am convinced that an army consisting of professional soldiers would be more efficient.
To begin with, the main problem relating to the military service is a serious lack of motivation. The young men are forced by the law to go soldier even if they are not motivated and I assume that unmotivated soldiers will not be efficient in case of war.
Moreover, some drill sergeants are a bit too fanatic: instead of cheering the raw recruits up, they put them off the army.
Another weak point concerning the military service is that when the young men are lucky enough to be employed as telephonist, drawer or something like that, they simply have no idea of how to spend their time. Is it a good method of training them to defend the nation?
A third negative point is the fact that while they are soldiers, the young boys do not earn anything or just enough to live! That is rather a serious problem as many of them have just finished their studies and want to earn money. Moreover, while they are not free from military service, thay can hardly find a job. Actually, they have to spend nine months doing and earning nothing which is very heartbreaking for the ones who are a bit ambitious.
To conclude with these different ideas, I would say that I disagree with the ones who are in favour of the compulsory military service because I think that the system is such that the soldiers are not motivated which can be dangerous for the nation, and for themselves, in case of war. That is just why I am convinced that professional soldiers, arguably motivated , would be more efficient.
Nevertheless, from a social point of view, we can perhaps find positive aspects which could bear out the maintenance of the military service.
The young men have to spend some times far from home, from their family. Moreover, the barracks are uncomfortable, the food is not very good, they have to wake up very early...
Those different factors may help them to have character and to cope with difficulties in the future. But, what about the soldier who goes home every evening?
A positive aspect of the military service can be seen in the fact that they are forced to live in group for nine months, which is not always as easy as one may think... But, did not they already learn to live in group at school or at university?
To conclude with this whole debate, I would say that I can hardly find positive arguments to stand for the compulsory military service. The only thing I hope is that the politicians realize that the abolition of the military service would be a great thing for everybody: the young men, the army in general and the security of the nation.

Oh my dear! When I read this statement I instantly thought: ""this has been written by a men who hasn't understood anything to the cause of women.""
This raises an important issue: according to me people still consider men and women as to different groups having their own stereotypes. In this order of things, there is nothing surprising about men calling women, who want to break with old traditions, androphobics, lesbians, frustrated, selfish persons. Why should men and women be different? You think they should because you have been educated in this way, because you are prejudiced. You live with these stereotypes but don't you realize you'd better be more critical about your way of looking at things.
Did feminists do more harm than good when they pointed out that women were subject to pressures. At work for example, a lot of them are harrassed by their employers or simply got a job because they were beautiful and slim. But then be sure the employer used them: attract customers...just be nice and keep quiet! Another point is that women were paid less althought they were performing the same jobs as men. Do you find this normal? Not at all!
The general scheme is: the woman in the kitchen, the woman with the children, the woman doing shopping, the woman working outside but also ironing and cleaning...and what about the man?
On the political scene, very few women have leading roles. Men often say they are not capable enough.
Sociolinguistically speaking it has been proved that women are more able than men to reach a compromise because they can listen to the other, they let him explain his point till his last word. At present, in our multiracial societies, this attitude is really an advantage.
Let's speak about men now. I don't want to condamn men.
Feminists neither! The truth is that when pointing out all these dicrepancies between both sexes feminists just want to call on men who really want to get rid of these stereotypes.
Feminists really believe such men exist and they want them to be an example, to educate their children in a new way, to show our society stereotypes are outdated. The new scheme is a cooperation between men and women, a natural gratitude giving birth to a nicer world. Let's abandon our prejudice!
And now the final question: did feminists do more harm than good to the cause of women? If you keep on with your prejudice, you will still agree. Then I advise you to be more critical about yourself and your way of life. Maybe you'll change your mind one day, I hope so! If you think you are'nt prejudiced but you still agree, you have'nt understood anything. But if you believe that feminists really want a change for the better not without but with men, you are in the new scheme, you belong to this new generation of equality and respect. Go on in this way!

A world dominated by science, industry and technology is often associated with the idea of constraining man's imaginative and dreaming power. Indeed, either the past or exotic cultures often evoke the idea of man and nature as being free from stress so that they could create fabulous myths and legends. This is seen from a superficial point of view, let us now consider this question on a deeper level.
When comparing our way of living and the one of the poorer cultures, one comes to realize that the modern society is particularly advantageous to the achievement of human fantasy.
First of all, let us focus on the advantages that theses modern phenomena provide on the social plan. Thanks to our ""social security"" system, people are able to enjoy, in return of their work, of a guaranty of a regular salary as well as a financial help in case of unemployment or medical care. These advantages result in the improvement of the living conditions.
This comfort, never known before, releases man from anxiety, suffering or material constraints. So, as man feels more at ease, he can blossom out and develop his dreaming and imagination into something creative.
As comfort increases, people grow in the possibility of discovering their own culture. They progressively will broaden up their general knowledge about the evolution of human civilisation. Being more educated, people can appreciate artistic manifestation and consequently, can event react to a formal and meaningless art and develop the abstract side. This was the case in the early twentieth century of the well-known French painter: ""Kandinsky"".
Moreover, on account of the many artistic realisations as art academies, music, literature and film, our Western society takes a great interest in dreaming and imaginative power. This is in opposition to less advanced societies where such realisations are impossible since people are more concerned with surviving.
Finally, man's fantasy can also benefit from the still improving technology to develop his creativeness in different areas. This is the case of science-fiction which can make use of special effects as well as in the field of music; technology has designed the synthesizer which produces many different sorts of sounds and effects. This has made possible, for instance, the emergence of the ""New Age"" music style.
As a conclusion, our modern western society favours man's dreaming and imagination. But his fantasy is different from the preceding generations. In earlier centuries, the imaginative creation took place in the religious field in order to explain the mysteries of nature. Imagination is as vigorous as before but has other means of expressing itself altough the basic themes are still the same: good versus evil.
Thanks to Science, Technology and Industry the world is not so mysterious. What has changed is that imagination is now considered as a resource to be exploited in the context of our ""leisure civilisation"". This reaches the point that there is less and less place for chance but more and more for dreaming and imagination.

FRUC3068,3.5,3.0,,,,,Feminists have done more harm to the cause of women than good,"
Forty years ago the famous French writer Simone de Beauvoir declared that ""The free woman is just being born"". When I hear that statement I immediately think of the feminist movements that have worked during the sixties and the seventies and that have repercussions now in the nineties. That is true that women had not many rights at the beginning of the century and that we needed an evolution, but I think that feminists have gone too far and have done more harm than good.
It is clear that today a woman's place is not only at home, that she has the right to have a job too. But I am not sure that now she is really free: free to do what she wants, free to go where she wants, free to be who she wants. She is perhaps even more a slave than before. She works, yes, but she is still the housewife in many households. How can these women reconcile professional life and sentimental or family life?
These ""liberated women"" are often working from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. and then they have to go back home, do the housework and nurse their children and husband. Even if their husbands can help them, these ""superwomen"" are often very tired and unfortunately very nervous at home and at work, and if they make the big mistake of complaining about it, men reply that they are the ones who wanted equality. Moreover I think that this equality is a source of divorce. A few years ago people thought twice before asking for a divorce, but now that women are financially independent they do not need their husband to support them anymore. Of course in some cases it may be a good thing but often, instead of trying to solve the problems, couples ask for a divorce without thinking of the consequences for the children.
The problem is in fact that many feminists confused equality and equivalence. A man is not a woman and a woman is not a man and that is not pejorative for the woman. Feminists say: ""there is nothing (no work) that a woman cannot do!"". Perhaps, but even if women are able to do any work they want, that is not always flattering for them to do these works. Can a woman be feminine, can she still be a woman if she works as a fire- fighter or as a truck-driver? In some cases there is really a loss of femininity, of identity. Another good reason for which I do not really believe in the benefits of feminism is that it makes men laugh. How do you think that a man react when he hears that a woman is shocked when she receives a letter beginning with ""Dear Sirs""? Of course, he finds it ridiculous that some women spend time fighting for such trivial matters.
It is in fact unfortunate that feminists have made of woman's liberation a war against men. Man should rather be woman's ally and not her enemy. Of course, I think that women must try to find their place in the society, but not at all costs. They must do it without too much noise and with all their femininity.

For several months now, it has been spoken of suppressing the compulsory military service in Belgium. Some people - the pessimistic ones - are already worried: what will happen in case of war, if Belgium can only rely on its professional soldiers? What will remain of the sense of patriotism and nationalism, essence of a country? On the other hand, the optimists see this decision as a step forward towards peace and integration. Between these two poles, the pragmatic people gladly receive the news as the suppression of the military service will no doubt save money for the State. All these opinions turn around one and the same question: is a system of military service valuable or should all armies consist exclusively of professional soldiers?
Our present society requires specialists, that is to say people who have been trained to practise a particular job: the doctor would not be able to do the job of a carpenter and vice versa. As far as professional soldiers are concerned, they also practise a job which requires a particular and typical training: they have to be acquainted with weapons, with fighting techniques and so on. To acquire this knowledge takes quite a long time which is reduced to ten months with regard to the compulsory military service. It means that non- professionl soldiers learn the smattering of the ""art of war"" and are supposed to be able to fight. From this, we can draw two conclusions: first, the training followed by professional soldiers is exagerated and unnecessary, and, second, every man is able to use weapons and fight without having been trained; the war in Yugoslavia illustrates this well: the fighters are mainly no soldiers but people who have taken the weapons to fight for their ideas. In this respect, the question of ambition can be introduced: in any case, when people do something for which they have no ambition, the results are often disastrous in the sense that very few remains of what had been learnt. How would behave people who stayed in the army less than a year in case of war? The compulsory military service is quite paradoxical in a world where efforts are made to improve peace, integration and communication between the individuals. A civil service would fit better in such a scheme: people - men and women - could devote some time of their life to work in institutions for orphans, delinquents or handicapped persons. Such an organization would not only improve peace but, on a more materialistic level, would also save money for the State; the money invested in the military service does not pay while it would be only beneficial to the whole society if it was invested in a civil service, beneficial not only economically but also psychologically and spiritually. Some people could argue that the consciousness of belonging to a country would fade with the disappearance of the military service. But the word ""patriotism"" should not only have a military connotation; patriotism can be expressed through numerous ways, the most obvious being sport.
On the whole, there would be more advantages in suppressing the present compulsory military service: the most important are economic and ethical ones. The army would then only lie in the hands of professional soldiers who have ambition in the military field and who receive therefore a special training.

In a era like ours where cities are packed with huge buildings and factories, where computers constitute the most redoubtable competitor of the human brain and where production and profit have become the main points of reference when we try to define the well-being of a particular community, the question of the place of dreaming and imagination arises in its most acute form.
The main problem concerning technology and industrialisation is that these two poles of the western civilisation have imposed a too realistic vision of life in this twentieth century. That implies that material values such as money, comfort, social status, industrial production, competition,...
have destroyed a large part of a particular ethics but also of dreaming and imagination.
This fact can be explained by many factors; one of them is that people simply do not find time for dreaming. Since the new big ""friend"" of industrialisation and technology (which we call ""stress"") has appeared, their life has been transformed into some sort of running of which we could make an unchanging outline if we wanted to: they wake up at seven o'clock, work eight or nine hours a day and then come back home particularly exhausted.
If we are aware of the fact that such time-tables are very common for people living in a modern society like ours, the problem of the place of imagination and dreaming is not even worth examining. Industrialisation has transformed dreaming into a waste of time which is now ""cleverly"" linked to money.
So, it is no wonder that dreamers are often regarded as marginal persons or even like fools by those who are fully integrated in the productive and competitive processes of our civilisation. According to them, dreaming would be meant for those naive people who have ""nothing better to do"" and who do not feel closely involved in the material problems of society.
Industrialisation and technology killed dreaming. This change in mentality, (in comparison with a previous period in which technology and industrialisation had not yet reached such a high level of development), is reflected in many aspects of our everyday life such as films (which are becoming more and more violent), the success of books which deal with societal problems, the increasing individualism of people in their job or hobbies. Another factor is that the massive intervention of sophisticated machines in the functioning of our modern industrial world has also largely reduced man's creativity and imagination. The creation of types of cars by incorporating data in a computer is only one isolated piece of evidence which shows us that the most beautiful property of man is now gradually being replaced by artificial ""brains"".
This type of work provided by computers leads obviously to some kind of uniformity and lack of originality. This statement is confirmed as we observe the similarities which exist between cars, for instance. This is a consequence from the fact that only those models which correspond to the mould of the ""brain"" of the computer or of any other machine can be created. That means that in most branches of industry, man's creativity has to conform to the power of technology. But fortunately, this statement cannot be extended to all fields of human activity. Occupations in connection with the elaboration of attractive advertisements or fashion, ... will always require the intervention of human imagination which will, of course, never be equalled by the work of any computer.
These sad observations are nothing but the confirmation of the problem related to the fact that our modern, industrialised society has forgotten the real value of dreaming and imagination. Since the beginning of mankind, these two human characteristics (which are in fact closely linked) have been representing an essential part of life and happiness. What right had technology and industrialisation to destroy them?
This question is very serious in itself but what is important is that dreamers and actual imaginative people have kept these skills which make happiness possible and that they know this.
Perhaps, the day is not far off when these ""fools"" will be kings.

Is there still a place for imagination and dreaming in our world? we may ask ourselves what the words ""dreaming and imagination"" really mean.
Personally I consider imagination as a means of escaping the reality: a so-called modern and materialistc world dominated by science and industrialisation and I intend to show that imagination is possible and even necessary at every stage of our life.
In the world we live in, everyone has to work very hard at school, at university, and later on in the active life in order to find and keep a job.
Being a little bit of a pessimist, one can say that life is a continual struggle in a world in which money has been established as a basic value.
I am not going to take every aspect of life into account but will confine myself to the educationnal process, the adult's life and the role of imagination in that context.
Being a child, we have to go the nursery school very early to learn how to read, speak, write and to acquire a socially based way of life: indeed we are suddenly confronted with a mass of children with whom we have to get acquainted.
At primary school, we have to attend different types of lessons (going from mathematics to gymnatics), most of which we are not interested in.
At secundary school, several options have to be chosen (e.g.
languages, mathematics, science) and exams have to be taken.
If we fail, we are considered as ""marginals"". It may then be necessary to look for another orientation (e.g. a professional orientation).
So far, I have brievly dealt with the educationnal process, I will now try to explain how I perceive the function of imagination in this context.
During childhood, imagination plays a fondamental role, various games are for instance played as ""let us imagine I am the mother and you are the father"". Besides childhood is often considered as the happiest period in one's life because it is characterized by insouciance: we are protected from the world around us by our parents and we often get everythink we need or want (T.V., games, computers a.s.o.)
During adolescence, we also make plenty use of our faculty of dreaming about the future, dream of becoming rich, an actor, of having a nice house with a swimming pool, tennis courts a.s.o. Moreover we only have minor problems at that stage.
Our dreams are still perceived as somethink which may become realizable.
Being an adult, we are confronted with the reality which is often not precisely what we had imagined: we have to work for one's living, we have to face difficulties, constraints, responsabilities, to obey to our superior.
A sure and even necessary means of coping with this new reality is dreaming e.g. looking at T.V., going to cinema, reading, going on holiday.
On one hand I think that nervous breakdowns are not far away if you don't find means of escaping reality but on the other hand people who tend to refuse reality and to build a imaginary world in which they are happier may in the long run have difficulties in differentiating reality from fantasy and become silly. A balance has thus to be found.

FRUC3075,3.0,,,,,,The prison system is outdated. No civilized society should punish its criminals: it should rehabilitate them,"
Recently, in the area of Verviers, two drug addicts released on parole, have raped and killed a couple of young adolescents. In Brussels, three gangsters strangle a taxidriver for his day's takings: 9000 francs! In a small village near Mons, a eight-year-old boy is murdered by an unbalanced person with no apparent reason.
Foul crimes have been increasingly numerous those days.
Besides we can easily be informed of most of them in any newspaper. This new wave of revolting trivial events is all the more worrying since it is linked to a rise of the small delinquance, implying a gerenalised climate of terror and a total mistrust of the citizens towards the police forces and the law, both accused of all vices and namely of being too lax with those evils. This anger towards our justice is today largely widespread among the population, frightened by the rise in violence: theafts, rapes, murders,...
What is the solution proposed by the justice to all these attacks? In all cases these facts are judged and sentenced to X years of prison. But is the sending to prison really a good solution? Does a prison sentence, imposed on the author of an offense or a crime, really dispense justice?
On the one hand, one admits that the murderer justly deserves this sentence because no one has the right to kill a human being. Nevertheless, in this particular case, sentences to twenty years prison or to hard labour for life won't bring back the murdered person to life. On the other hand, the cases of people being mugged by a recidivist are on the increase.
That brings us to the question of whether prison is really the ideal solution. In fact, experts are blaming it for being ""criminogene"", that is for being an area where the small delinquents get harder and learn the rules of organized crime.
So instead of ""punishing"" them, would'nt it be a better idea to rehabilitate them? To give them a chance of behaving in a less violent or aggressive way? Of course there is no miracle: dangerous people are not going to become angels all of a sudden. It is a long-time process. Given the fact that society is responsible, for a great part, for the violence of these people, so why not making huge efforts in order to make these people aware that, even if society won't change, it tries to help them access to a better way of life?
Unfortunately, the efforts for social rehabilitation of prisoners are derisory for lack of means and good will of our politicians.
However, our Minister of Justice, Melchior Wathelet, has proposed a new reform project: the delinquents would be sentenced, not more to prison, but to general interest labour, that is they would have to work between 20 and 140 hours in public utilities. Moreover they would be followed by psychologists or social assistants in order to facilitate their reintegration in society. This is an important point because in a sane and civilised society nobody should be a social outcast.
The issue we have considered here clearly does not admit of an easy solution but let's hope that the government will take steps to ameliorate its worst effects.

FRUC3076,3.0,2.0,,,,,The prison system is outdated. No civilized society should punish its criminals: it should rehabilitate them,"
""Bloody hostage-taking: three prisoners escape, one guard is killed"". Everyday we hear and watch about violent events, about people who have been agressed at home or in the street.
As a matter of fact, violence is dangerously becoming more and more frequent and even common: as a whole, it is no longer surprising, although it is still shocking, to see a young defensiveless boy beaten by several hooligans...
This problem of social violence can be seen through two aspects: the prevention and the repression. Nowadays our society is putting the stress on prevention in order to limit as much as possible the wave of attacks in our cities: severe controls of identity (when its is legally possible), surrounding and following of groups at risk like the young delinquants, the social misfits... But the civilians and the authorities are extremely powerless in the face of such violent behaviours and the means they have at their disposal, (financial as well as physical (number of available force to assure protection or to carry out controls, for instance)) are far less sufficient. In some cases of attacks it was impossible to forecast such behaviours and thus no special measures could be be taken. I allude here to the case of a young mentally disabled who lethally hurt a young boy.
Although people knew about his mental trouble, the young disabled could not be previously put into prison, because he had done nothing reprehensible yet. But then the question rose (like it is much too often the case): does a child have to be killed before the police positively act? This example is given here to illustrate the complexity of the prevention.
The other aspect is that of the repression, adopted by most societies. But here again it is far from being so clear.
Let us imagine the world of the prison as a separate unity with its own rules, values, and its own code of honour. The small criminal who enters this world has to adapt himself to these rules. As long as he remains in prison, he will get very limited contact with the outside world. When he will be released, his situation will be very painful because he will have, alone, to re-adapt and re-integrate himself in a society he has been excluded from. Moreover he will have the greatest difficulties of integration because of his past as a prisoner.
People are suspicious, they do not want to get involved with anybody who once did something reprehensible or simply who spent some time in prison. No wonder that those ex-prisoners feel injustly rejected and remain social misfits with all the consequences of this (feeling of injustice, wish for revenge, latent violence, deliquancy...).
The increase of violence gives birth to tow major concerns: the increasing number of people in the prisons and the people's lack of comprehension to the prisoners' problematic situation (during and after their imprisonment).
It is publicly known that prisons are overcrowded, new prisons are built but it is not sufficient. So several men have to live in a limited space. They get in touch with other criminals who may be more dangerous. The resentment towards society may be exacerbated because of the lack of privacy together with the loss of freedom and a deep wish for revenge.
But this aspect of things is very complex: on one hand, nobody can know for sure whether a criminal who has spent his time in prison, is really freeable and able to re-integrate society; on the other hand, he has paid for what he had done and cannot be legally kept in jail any longer. The measures Minister of Justice Mr Wathelet has taken in that respect mean a step forwards when he makes it possible to maintain a criminal who is legally freeable but still potentially dangerous, in a special institution - a kind of intermediate stage - for a period that is determined by a judge.
As a conclusion, we can see that, although there is some progress, very much has to be done for the reintegration of the ex-prisoners in the society. But first of all, the mentality of our societies has to change and to be more tolerant towards those people who have once failed but who have paid for that. Because we have no right to refuse them to chance of a new start.

FRUC3077,3.5,,,,,,Feminists have done more harm to the cause of women than good,"
The statement according to which ""feminists have done more harm than good to the cause of women"" certainly holds true in the majority of cases. It should not however be generalized because the feminist movement has also helped to improve the condition of women in several respects. In the following essay we shall examine this issue from a linguistic, social and conjugal perspective.
From a linguistic point of view, certain things have gone better. Terms which were negatively connotated have been replaced by euphemisms. One can mention the word ""woman"" which has undergone that process. But, as often happens with euphemisms, once it is introduced, it very soon acquires a negative connotation as well. A new euphemism will be created, and it will on turn be badly connotated. The positive effect of the femenist action is in those cases of very short term.
If we take our example again, ""woman"" was replaced by ""lady"" but that word itself got the same connotations as ""woman"". As a result, it could no longer be considered as a euphemism.
Very often things have gone even worse. Indeed, the outcome of the feminist revolution has generally been that, by stressing the linguistic inequalities, the male versus female opposition has been reinforced. To take a simple example, women believed that the term ""mistress"" had a negative influence on their social image because it had a sexual connotation. The masculine counterpart had, on the other hand, no such connotation. Thus, using ""mistress"" to refer to a woman was seen as demeaning whereas using ""master"" to refer to a man stressed his social power. Therefore, women believed that the use of ""mistress"" would strike a blow at their position in society, and they wanted that word to be crossed out of their vocabulary. By doing this, women only made the linguistic inequality, most people were unaware, of more striking.
From a social perspective, one could at first think that much progress has been made in favour of the female part of the population. Indeed, they have been given occupations which are socially significant, and they have shown that they could work hard, take important decisions, and become involved in business. Nowadays, they are no longer confined to their houses, doing the housework, and chitchatting with the neighbour during the coffee break. Their position is still improving nowadays. For example, a recent bill has been passed in Belgium according to which there ought to be a certain percentage of women among the ministers. But, here also, things have to be relativized because every job is not as appealing as a minister function. Asking for jobs only men could do before, women had to accept everything related to that, namely the stable working hours, the possibly hard working conditions, etc. Also, practising their new jobs, women have come to realize that it is not 'all rosy'.
Finally, things have evolved in the conjugal relations. The result of their increasing role in society was that women could no longer care for everything at home. Men found themselves invited to look after the children, to carry out the domestic chores, such as the washing, the cleaning up, the cooking, etc. But, here, one could wonder whether it can be seen as a consequence of women's actions or because men became more and more sensitive to those domestic tasks, and wanted to give up their solely lucrative position.
The statement put forward at the beginning has been looked at from a linguistic, social and conjugual point of view, and it should be from now on clear that the consequences of the feminist movement have not been either all black or all white. Perhaps, one could ask oneself now what would have happened if no action had been taken at all. But this is another debate.

FRUC3080,3.0,3.0,,,,,"In his novel ""Animal Farm"" George Orwell wrote ""All men are equal but some are more equal than others"". How true is this today?","
I think it turns out to be true to a great extent today. It will be still truer tomorrow. Men's equality is a right inscribed in most constitutions, which is too often simply reduced to words. ""Some men are more equal than other ones"" means that some have more chance of being equal than others.
They are allowed to benefit from their rights as they are educated, they live well, they have money and/or power.
Therefore, their rights are less often violated. While men without education will easily be deceived. While men under less favourable conditions will first think of their survival.
Then, they will perhaps think of their rights. Above all, people who have money can surround themselves with advisers and good lawyers. The lalder (ones) will defend the first's rights; if necessary. While a poor man has to face justice alone as he is given a lawyer who, most often, doesn't care about his client because he will not win a lot of money.
Powerful men are the first to take advantage of their rights: as 'they decide, 'they know all the tricks of the system. If George Orwell's statement applies well to individuals, it also applies to countries or to continents. Today, we can view the world situation from the point of view of ""equality"" among the different countries. For instance, African countries have fewer rights than Western countries. Who cares about Somalia's civil war and its starvation? While 2 years ago, the whole world cared about Kuwait. The difference lies not in the ""equality of rights"" but in the soil: no oil, on the one hand; lots of oil on the other hand. But the American or the European interventionism in other countries always relies on ""the respect of human freedom"". ""In name of human rights"", USA is prone to act as a knight but if no economical interest lies ""deep"" under ""humanity"", the knight will suddenly turn asleep.
It is thus a case of ""more"" or ""less"" equality (thanks to ""more"" or ""less"" oil).
Actually, what does equality mean to political prisoners, guilty of saying things differently from their leaders?
Are Pinochet's prisons not full of less equal people?
To counter-balance this dark description, we can approve of the growing awareness of men's inequality. Some try to fill the gap between men, countries and continents. But they are too few to solve the problem. We could also have said that the USSR fall and the opening of the Eastern block have meant a greater equality within Europe. But the rising of racism, nationalism and nazism prove that equality is far from being well-established among men. Equality is ideally based upon respect and readiness to let down one's privileges to reach one unique level for everybody. Once again, it is more often words than acts in this field.
To conclude, inequality is more and more pronounced as time passes: we create a world with 2 speeds; which perfectly suits those on the higher level. If a change occurs, it will come from the lower level. So, the future will tell us how it will work.

FRUC3081,3.0,3.0,,,,,The prison system is outdated. No civilized society should punish its criminals: it should rehabilitate them,"
In our society, criminals are punished for what they have done, which very often leaves them with a feeling of revenge: once they are free, they commit other crimes. It makes me think that the prison system is not adequate. In fact, the problem lies in the structure of our prisons: instead of being a complete rupture with the outer world, they should rehabilitate the criminals, in proposing manual or intellectual activities according to their abilities. A good idea would be to give them the opportunity to practise some sport, to follow courses in fields they are interested in.
Concerning those who commit minor offenses, it would be better to let them work outside prisons so that they would feel useful to the society they live in.
Psychologists should be at their disposals to help them, for they may not know why they act in such a way f.i. why he/she killed his/her neighbour, why he/she cannot stop stealing things in supermarkets etc.
I do believe that prison is not the right place for any criminal. There should be particular institutions for those who are mentally alienated as the rapists, others for the young people etc.
In the case of those who seem to have psychological problems, their behaviours should be observed by specialists, who would check if there is an improvement or not. Of course, it is always difficult to know whether they would be able to lead a complete normal life.
I remember reading a short story called 'Mr Loveday's little outing' two years ago. It is about a man, who has been in an asylum for thirty-five years because in his youth he killed a young woman quite unknown to him, whom he knocked of her bicycle and then throttled. After his crime, he gave himself up immediately. However, in the last twenty years, he has been acting as a very sane man. As a reader, you have good reasons to think that he is cured. But, once he is out, he cannot prevent himself from killing another woman. So it is impossible to answer the question, when you can let these people out and yet it is a risk you have to take.
In the case of adolescents who are lacking moral principals, a programme should be established to rehabilitate them. It is important to correct their visions of the world as well as their attitudes towards their fellow beings. So one should not punish them but to make them understand that they may not act as they please.
In connection with this, our Lord Chancellor Whatelet is encouraging a quicker penal procedure. According to him, it is inconceivable that a delinquent should wait several months before appearing before a court of justice.
As a conclusion, I would say that a man, whatever he has done, remains a man and has the right to be respected as such. It is inhuman to give sedatives to the prisoners or to let four of them live in a very small room; even an animal could not bear it. I also think that the government should engage a team of psychologists who would reflect on the problem of emprisonment.

FRUC3085,2.5,3.0,,,,,"Some people say that in our modern world, dominated by science and technology and industrialisation, there is no longer a place for dreaming and imagination. What is your opinion?","
""H, mum, I would like to look at my favourite cartoon on T.V., you know: Goldorak. It is time."" These are the words a mother often hears. Where are our nice and gentle cartoons from ""old times""? The answer is quite simple: this is one of the numerous examples which show that dreaming and imagination no longer have a place in our industrialised world dominated by science technology.
Of course, progress in science technology can be very good but it can have a very bad influence on other fields: if we consider that researchers discovered new techniques (used at war), we have not to wait so much time to see that it was also adapted in cartoons. And it is where it is dangerous. The aim of cartoons is to provide a child with relaxation and dream.
Who dares to say he has never dreamt he was a knight or a princess of a magic world? I often dreamt that I was Candy, this beautiful girl who was in search for her parents and who was in love with a very handsome boy! Yes, but boys and girls of ten are no longer interested in that kind of cartoons. They want violence through cartoons and it can be a nuisance at school for some boys want to imitate their heroes and do what they see in cartoons. And the dream is over... However, there is some gradual return to simplicity with Euro Disney in France or the Efteling in the Netherlands!
As for imagination, does it still exist? The word imagination is mysterious: it implies a notion of creativity but also something which is far away, a sort of ability to be in another world. But, yes, industrialisation is still developing. The same is true for science technology: computers can be perfect translators, this is what non-translators think. They do not realize there are some subtle nuances that cannot be rendered by a computer because it can be useful but has some defects: it does not know anything about the period of the text or the author's life. Unlike the computer, the translator can use his imagination in a good way. His brain is full of data that a computer does not know because it cannot even rearrange data.
Imagination has always played an important role in our societies but we have noticed for some time that it was disappearing because people have no time to be imaginative.
There is something paradoxal: progress were made to help the housewife: washing-machine, tumble-dryer, dishwasher and yet, some of them find no time to cook something fresh for the whole family. They go shopping and often buy ready-made meals.
So, where is the pleasure of cooking something for the Family.
Does imagination play a role in that type of cooking? But, yes, it allows women to devote more time to their career. I
can take another example which is really striking to me since I am interested in musics: you do not have the opportunity to listen to those songs which sound very well for natural songs do no longer exist. Everything is computerized: you want to create a song and suppose you make some mistakes. No problem!
The computer shall help you and you can forget your imagination.
As a conclusion, I would like to say that, despite industrialisation and science technology, people have to know that it is really important to dream and to be imaginative as most people were a long time ago!

FRUC3086,3.0,3.0,,,,,The prison system is outdated. No civilized society should punish its criminals: it should rehabilitate them,"
Only yesterday I heard on the radio that the prison warders in Namur went on strike because they thought that they were not numerous enough. On the other hand, prisoners themselves sometimes take legal action to fight bad conditions in prison.
So, everything leads me to believe that there is some problem with the prison system. But what kind of problem?
As everyone knows, from having seen it on television for example, prisons tend to be more and more comfortable: prisoners often have a television for instance! The least one can say is that from a material point of view, they lack nothing. As far as social relations are concerned, they are allowed to play cards together, to practise a sport, etc...
In this connection, let us make it quite clear that the prisoners are all in relation with others and that may be sometimes unfavourable. One has only to instance the influence of a man like Hamers on other prisoners who are just first offenders.
Paradoxical though it may seem, prison is no solution. Most of the people who have been in prison for twenty years or more are ""socially"" dead. They will be no more accepted as such in society. This is the reason why I think the legal system should provide them with social workers when they come out of prison. These ones should rehabilitate them, helping them to find a job, for example. But the problem is that prisons themselves lack money to support the prisoners! So, such a social aid is unconceivable. It is also essential to realise that when prisoners come out of prison, their friends (or feinds) most of the time wait for them and so they are immediately reintroduced in their unfavourable environment.
When I say that prison is no solution, I don't want to say that prisoners should remain free in society. On the contrary, we must keep them in an institution that would make them work to pay their stay in prison. So, the work would be justified.
Moreover, economic problems could then be solved and prison warders could be more numerous.
At this stage, I would like to make a comparison between a prisoner and a child. When a child makes a mistake whatever it is, it is no use giving him a punishment without a purpose. It should always be motivated by some purpose or other. If your child has stolen something to your neighbour, you should ask him to give it back and apologize for it rather than to forbid television, for instance.
Next I wish to focus our attention on the following aspect: when prisoners have been staying for some years in prison, they often keep alive some sort of hatred for society. And when they are on a penitentiary leave, they are sometimes even more violent than before. One of the most striking examples is what happened to this young couple in Plombires a few months ago. What conclusions may be drawn from all this? According to me, the prison system is not outdated: it has never been a solution per se. A ""motivated punishment"" which would rehabilitate the prisoners could be useful.

FRUC3087,3.5,2.0,,,,,"Some people say that in our modern world, dominated by science and technology and industrialisation, there is no longer a place for dreaming and imagination. What is your opinion?","
We often speak of dreams around us. Without putting forward premature conclusions, we can nevertheless notice that a certain importance is granted to them. Freud, the Surrealists and well before them Icarius, had shown a special attention for dreams. Ever since, in a world dominated by science, technology, industrialisation, we can wonder if there is still a place for dreaming and imagination.
At the beginning of the twentieth century, Freud's theories appear. Dreams are viewed as an expression of our repressed feelings, desires. From then onwards, the emphasis is laid on this mysterious world.
Few years later, at the end of the first world war, many people are disgusted by the reality they are confronted with: death, destruction, poverty, stupidity... They have to take a new lease of life. In the inter-war years, an intellectual movement, the Surrealists, takes shape. Under colour of civilisation, under pretext of progress, all that rightly or wrongly may be regarded as fantasy or superstition has been banished from the mind. In reaction against the rotted capitalist society, the Surrealists decide to explore the realm of the unconscious and underline the omnipotence of Dream.
That the Dream is useless, as escape from reality, the dreamer a self-indulgent and lazy person is the accepted view of an overwhelming majority. Reality and dream, for the Surrealists, are not opposed but have to become in harmony with one another.
Considering that man spends more than a third of his life on earth in sleep, how could he neglect or even ignore the world of Dream, the imagination. The modern man is full of dreams and I think his story can be compared with Icarius' experience. Dedalus and his son Icarius imagined to make wings out of wax to come out of the labyrinth, in which they had been cooped up. Icarius, identifying himself with a bird, approached the sun too near and fell into the water. Another possible interpretation would be to associate the wings with dreams as the labyrinth with reality... Anyway, when the dreams come true, they sometimes turn into nightmares. The planes invented by man are beautiful but what a terrible beauty when he uses them for dropping bombs! The progress in technology is wonderful but what for if instead of helping man, it does away with him. The list of examples is endless and these few examples suffice to clearly understand the problematic.
Through these lines, I have tried to underline the omnipotence of Dream. Since ever, man dreams of power, domination; he always wants more and the dream, far from counterbalancing the reality, now masks it. Man is caught in a vicious circle: after beauty comes destruction. Tomorrow or at any time, an intellectual group - as the Surrealist one - may appear to react against the misuse of Dream and revalue the liberty of the imagination. Now new questions appear to me: To what extent may the dreams come true? Is it more important to dream or to realize our dreams? Would it not be safer to maintain a distance between both?

To the reader: This is not a formal essay: It is a dreamy essay.
It is true that navety, dreaming and imagination are irremediably losing ground in our modern and highly civilized societies.
To begin with, all kinds of ""irrational religions"" which include more than one god or worship non-human divinities have been abolished. The civilizations which went on following their traditions were called ""primitives"", and there was a strong urge on the part of the western missionaries to teach them our modern principles and exploit them. So a mercantile interest overshadowed genuine and peaceful communities.
But now, it is religion itself which is somewhat losing importance in the life of the modern man. Some basic values and religious virtues are outdated, and finally no more reguarded as crucial. The modern man can peacefully enjoy life with the new prospects now offered to him by science, high technology and industry. He has got his personal comfort, his hous, his car, his television, his work, his funny gadgets, and he can have fun with the next-door girl. Why should he refuse?
Through history, religion was basically felt as a need, a help for the poor hungry masses that were busy trying to survive.
They could only appease their fears and misfortunes; find their hopes in religion. Religion was useful to keep them living and working.
Just as religion is more or less losing this ""utility"" in our modern world, dreaming and imagination are following the same way.
If you want to succeed in this society you only have to study, work hard, be intelligent, be beautiful, have money, and forget about the rest. No matter if people are unhappy around you! Instead of taking their human feelings into account, what you have to do in business is to try to solve a problem by means of figures, dollars, subsidies, profits... by counting, calculating and making abstraction of data of any other kind.
The most promising jobs in the future are those that involve finance, trade, business, diplomacy thus excluding dreaming and imagination we would find in the arts, for instance.
As a concrete example, I can mention what a young american student in economics told me during my holidays Singapore.
He is only twenty, comes from a rich family, he is beautiful, he has travelled a lot all over the world, he goes to one of the best universities in the States - I mean Yale - he has everything we could dream of. We had a talk about studies, and when I told him I was about to begin my last year in germanic philology, he replied that it must be all very well and funny to listen to some literature, history and philosophy, but that all this was really useless and that it wouldn't lead me very far if I wanted to have some kind of career worthy of this name.
Anyway, how sad would the world be if everybody was busy with economics!
We had some kind of ""privilege relationship"", and I was interested in the guy. But as I was not staying for a long time - I had to take the plane two weeks after - he tried to make me understand that it was impossible, that he was sad too but that I was really too irrational, that I was an idealist.
He, on the other hand, thought he had a good point at being an extremely realistic, materialistic man. He carefully warned me: Pay attention and take care of yourself. If you are too idealistic, you are going to fall back on the ground one day and suffer a great deal.
This is the kind of world we are living in right now. But without any dream we are just machines; perhaps we suffer but we do not feel any true joy either. And maybe in this world of machinery, pollution and high technology, the man will again feel the need to go back to his roots, live more simply and give some more place to sincere relationships and dreams.

FRUC3089,3.5,3.5,,,,,The prison system is outdated. No civilized society should punish its criminals: it should rehabilitate them,"
The problem of incarceration is now part of the headlines in the newspapers. The numerous revolts in France, the rebellions of the prisoners in the different countries in Europe show that the criminals are not submitted persons but real individuals the lot of whom has to be seriously taken into account.
In a period where the prisons become too small to keep them, a question arises: should our society go on punishing those people who have harmed their fellow citizens or on the contrary, should we give them another chance of being rehabilitated in everyday life?
First of all, it is important here to make a distinction between the dangerous criminals and the others who were never involved in murders or violent actions. For example, somebody who refuses to do his military service should not be put in the same room as a murderer. Yet this happens and people do not react against this absurdity.
It is obvious that the former deserves punishment but does not need to be rehabilitated while the latter may deserve both.
Secondly, a criminal who does harm because of bad conditions of life has not the same motives for his illegal action as a criminal who commits evil for its own sake. For the former who acts for his survival, rehabilitation is more important than punishment. This one needs the support of social workers and teachers, for instance, who can teach him the bases of his possible future work in the society in which he will be released later on. Once again, the second case is more arguable.
Thirdly, it is not true that all prisons are outdated. In Belgium as in France, some prisons are fitted out with the necessary staff and material to rehabilitate the offenders. It must be possible for some of the prisoners to focus their impulsive power in sportive activities, to attend some classes, which would give them an additional advantage for their reinsertion in society, to be listened to by some psychologists who would help them to overcome difficulties of all kind...
All this requires a lot of money, of course but if long-term results are beneficial for the prisoner himself, for the society in which he lives and also contribute to reducing the population in jail, would money not be worth investing?
The problem we have considered clearly does not admit of an easy solution. It is essential, above all, not to consider prisoners as a herd of beasts who are all alike. Each of them is a different individual with a different problem. However, if rehabilitation must be part of the prison system, we cannot suppress punishment for all that, this would be a too easy solution for some people, wouldn't it?

It is half past four at the Johnson's. Outside a cold bright october sun is shining. The children have just come back from school and are already sitting in front of the television, watching their favourite programme. We are in nineteen ninety- two. Sixty years ago, when our grandmothers were young, things were different. After school, children used to camper about happily with friends and came back home for supper with healthy faces. When children were playing, they kept on inventing new games; they could enjoy themselves with very little indeed: sticks, marbles, unsophisticated dolls... In the evening, the parents found time to talk to their children, to play with them. But in our modern world, everyone is under pressure. When parents come home after their busy day, they cook the dinner hastily so that they can at last enjoy some rest around nine o'clock. What about the children then?
""Luckily"", television and computer games keep them busy.
Often, television is also on when the family is having dinner.
No one speaks for fear of missing some important element of the programme. After dinner, most parents are exhausted, they have been hurried all day long to produce more work, they have struggled with the computer, and they just feel incapable of doing anything else than swallowing a TV programme. By the end of the day, children have in fact not played at all; they have not dreamt, not created any world of their own. Can we call computer games creative games? I do not think so. Automation makes our children look like miniaturized adults, it kills their innocence, their dream and their imagination.
Most teenagers nowadays are spoilt children who have grown up too fast. They are often blas, they have become incapable of dream and wonder. Teachers notice that most: they are no longer able to interest their pupils in anything. Youngsters come up with unhappy, indifferent faces and most of them no longer expect anything from the future. No wonder: they are living in a deshumanised world, where only productivity matters, where human relations and family life have become less important than money. Their parents have long been under pressure, have hardly found time for them. Who can then blame them for not looking forward to starting a professional life in this society?
May I dream of a world where parents will be able to find time for their children? Where children will not be deprived of their childhood by sophisticated computer games? Where family life will be restored? Parents, take your children for walks in the nature, take them to the theater, play with them,...
let them just be kids. Give them hope and trust in the future.

FRUC3092,3.0,2.0,,,,,Most university degrees are theoretical and do not prepare students for the real world. They are therefore of very little value,"
To understand how universities have been created in Occident, we have to go back to the Middle Ages. Only a few monks or future monks were concerned with school at that time. Cut off the real world they were gathering in monasteries or schools where they were learning through old books, most of the time about antiquity. They were said to have a vocation for this kind of life. Universities have developped in this way since the 12th century.
But what about these prestigious institutions today? To caricature them rapidly one could say that universities consist of courses given by professors (competent in their fields) in front of a silent audience who is conscientiously taking notes. So one can wonder if a university degree really prepare students for real world and what his value is nowadays.
I think it is true that lectures in themselves are theoretical. Firstly because students spend most of their time sitting in big classrooms which do not allow practical exercises but only ex cathedra lectures. Secondly because the subjects of the lectures are theoretical. For example: during a general methodology course (which, we think, could be more practical) different theories as Krashen's, Lado's or ?
studied in detail but practical points are hardly ever considered.
However is it true that this formation does not prepare students for real world? I am of the opinion that the answer is no. First I think that university degrees are theoretical on purpose (as opposed to high schools which are more practical.) The reason is that, thanks to the theoretical background they have learned, university students are able to build up their own way to achieve their aim. Moreover they are also able to adapt or to modify their method according to the situation. To take the example of a teacher again, I could say that a teacher in front of a classroom do not think about particular methodological theories again but that he has created his own methodology. Secondly, I think that academic studies develop a critical mind. The students are indeed trained to analyse pieces of information coming from different horizons from a critical point of view, which means that they have to dissect them, to confront them and then to be able to pass judgment on them. That is the way they should create a personal opinion for themselves.
Nevertheless, I do not want to go too far. I really think that theory is essential but I am convinced that practice should also be present. Let's take the example of a student in economics who has his certificate in his pocket and proudly goes working in a big firm for the first time. I would compare this business man to a gentleman who perfectly knows the highway code and who knows how to start and how to run through the gears but who finds himself in the center of Paris at the peak hours the first time he really drives! By this example, I want to show that theory must always be accompagnied by practical applications, which is not often the case at university. I think that this is a fully justified criticism against this institution.
So what about the value of university degrees? I really think that they are of great value because they can turn out intellectuals of high level. But they would be more effective and closer to everyday life if they were more practical (university students can still sometimes be compared to the monks of the 12th century!) These changes have been considered and some reform projects have already been carried out: there was a seminar about this subject and ""mta courses"" (""mta"" stands for ""mtamorphose"") were organised last year. I hope we will go further in this direction.

FRUC3093,3.0,3.0,,,,,Most university degrees are theoretical and do not prepare students for the real world. They are therefore of very little value,"
Experience is a major asset for any job applicant, and this very common requirement in job offers seems to corroborate the statement according to which ""most university degrees are theoretical and do not prepare students for the real world, (and that) they are therefore of very little value.""
This opinion however can be criticized on several grounds.
Although it is true that most university degrees are theoretical, it does not mean that they do not prepare students for the ""real world"", or professional world where they will have to put what they have learned into practice. A
chemist who has just recently graduated from college will probably take more time to make a pharmaceutical preparation than a practically trained lab technician, but after a time, when he has gained experience, he will be as good as him, and what is more, he will be able to understand what he is doing, being able to detect possible mistakes made by the general practitioner. Furthermore, he will always have a kind of overview on whatever he will do, which the technician, trapped in his mechanical routine, will never have. We here find an illustration of one of the university graduate's major assets: his critical sense. His theoretical studies must have given him the tools to think for himself and not to accept everything he is told without further analysis.
University studies also form students to be methodical and organized. they must be able to see at once what is important in each of the different subjects their curriculum includes, and to assimilate it in such a way that they will be able to render it at the exam, showing they have understood it. This will provide them with an analytical spirit, another great asset in their future life, when they will be confronted with entirely new situations for which they will have to find straightforward solutions.
Next to those qualities, university also gives students the opportunity to meet people from various backgrounds: geographical, social, intellectual, ... and they should make the most of it, talking and exchanging ideas, trying to understand other mentalities, learning to respect people who are different from them. Various programs even give students the chance to go abroad, and this probably is the best preparation for the ""real"" world. Their degree will indeed give them the skills necessary for their future profession, even if they first need some time to adapt to its practice, but they will have gained something more essential from their contacts with other people: an open mindedness which will make them aware that their professional or familial world is but a small part of a much larger one, which might rightly be called ""the real world.""

FRUC3094,3.0,2.5,,,,,"Some people say that in our modern world, dominated by science and technology and industrialisation, there is no longer a place for dreaming and imagination. What is your opinion?","
If we were to compare the human race to a species, we could easily be likened to ants which bustle about around the queen bee just like employees before the screen of the God Computer.
The human coming and going seems to leave little place to dream, fantasy and imagination.
Indeed, it is to be noticed in our present society that all human energy and creativity is devoted to technical, scientific and rational ends. Since then, man has no more time left to dream and above all, he doesn't dream any longer since dreams are useless, are not profitable in a world which speaks in terms of efficacity. Moreover, giving oneself up to useless dreaming can be viewed as a waste of time, and time is precious, according to the byword ""Time is money"". In this connection, money takes on a fundamental value in our world determined by competitiveness and elitism which reduce our propensity for dreaming, that is the opportunity to return to simple things. Indeed, science urges Man to fight in order to remain the best; doing so, science confines man in some egoism which diverts him from authentic realities, which excludes all kinds of fantasy. Our society gives requirements of rentability: Man has to ""function well"", like a machine devoid of all imagination.
Up to now, it would be easy to deduce that our society relegates all that shows an irrational character. This is not the case. We have to admit that art, born of dream and imagination, doesn't stop existing before the growing threat of utilitarianism. Art is necessary, is just like a breath of truth in a world that is too regulated, too calculated. To my mind, scientifics unconsciously thank artists and all those who have been able to protect dreams far from the grasp of technology. Indeed, each man needs to have some spiritual evasion, to find some dimension of authenticity thanks to his fabulous imagination. So there is a place for dreaming, but a calculated place, since dreams are now assigned a secondary, accessory role: We are ""allowed"" to dream during half and an hour, during the time of a film, before going on working again. Why has dreaming lost (his) its essential value and does it get a little positive connotation?
In fact, dreaming often implies some kind of carelessness and anticonformism. Indeed, to admit we often have dreamy thoughts is to reveal ourselves different from others, that is closer to reality and simplicity, what makes people going away.
Dreaming also means taking a risk, the risk of showing some fanciful character in a society which requires strict and rational people.
Now, as far as imagination is concerned, it is the object of a very important requirement in the world of advertising, for instance. The most original the idea, the most opportunities the product will have to be sold and to bring in money.
Imagination can be profitable, contrary to dreams.
Finally, it is not so much the domination of technology which kills our ability to dream. Dreams cannot make up the most part of our life, otherwise the world would be lead to its decline. Still, only a little place for dreaming is necessary to give life again to a society which is sometimes too blind to the simple, pure and beautiful things of existence.

FRUC3095,3.5,2.0,,,,,All armies should consist entirely of professional soldiers: there is no value in a system of military service,"
Compulsory military service is useless: not only do most young men spoil one year of their existences but the so-called ""trained"" soldiers they become also turn out to lack vocation.
How many times in his life does a boy hear the sentence ""military service will make a man of you"" or ""go and do your military service: it is your duty towards homeland""? These two clich-sentences are unfortunately the only ones you can say to a young man between sixteen and twenty-five to motivate him to do his military service. Indeed, what would be the other ""positive"" aspects of interrupting either one's study or one's career for nearly one whole year, during which one's salary sometimes does not exceed 150 Belgian francs a week!!? This financial problem could probably be easily solved by the people who still live at their parents' places, but what about those who have left home and must pay between 15 000 to 25 000 francs each month for the rent of their flats?
Maybye one could argue that the sportive aspect of the military service is appealing enough to enjoy doing it. The only problem there, is that after one week, there is every chance that the guys would be fed up with crawling in the mud, marching for six hours in the middle of the night, or going on bivouac for three whole days!
One could also mention the friendly social environment and contacts... especially those made with hysterical sergeants shrieking all around ""you fat assholes, get your balls ready!"". Neither the wonderful gastronomic ""red beans 'n compote 'n fish 'n gravy food"", nor the marvellously comfortable cement beds will help. And in cases of war, these forced militiamen are very likely to be unmotivated and depressed soldiers rather than reckless heroes. Because this is the point! Originally, military service was instituted to train men and make them brilliant soldiers, in order to defend the country in hard times. But the compulsory character and the negative aspects of it have brought about the problem of a lack of vocation. And what is the use of an army if it is filled with unwilling or even pacific soldiers? On the other hand, while most young people do their military service without really wanting it, professional soldiers have chosen to join the army and feel therefore more responsible for their jobs. Enlisting solely professional soldiers would not only prevent the government from losing money in training, feeding and giving accommodation to unwilling militiamen, but it would also make the army more effective!
Because compulsory military service often interrupts a career, because it provides too small wages to be able to survive decently, and because it is very unpleasant to do, most young people do not really feel like becoming soldiers, even for 10 months. To solve this problem, military service should stop to be obligatory and should leave a choice to those young men who, in fact, find themselves at the beginning of their real lives.

FRUC3097,3.5,,,,,,All armies should consist entirely of professional soldiers: there is no value in a system of military service,"
Both the militiaman and the soldier are happy that the government has decided to put an end to the compulsory military service. Indeed, the militia as a system of defence was not only inefficient but it represented a waste of time for the young man and it made it impossible to raise the pay of the soldier.
To familiarize a man with the use of arms and to turn him into an efficient soldier is very expensive and, as the economic state of the country is quite bad, it is impossible to train every young man doing his military service. That is why the young man who joins the army for at least two years is the first to be trained. The others, the militiamen are mostly doing the fatigues such as to sweep the square or to peel the potatoes. That year of fatigues (now eight months) frustrates the militiaman who considers himself as the slave of the soldier. When that young man eventually leaves the army, he gives it an unwelcomed publicity considering that he has learned very little that could help him to defend his country.
Another disadvantage of the military service is that the young man has to devote one year of his life to a useless thing. In fact, he often gives his country more than this year of military service as his integration into the army only occurs a few months after the end of his studies and that, in that span of time, he is unable to find a job corresponding to his qualifications and where he could be appointed. It is, indeed, quite understandable that a man, which will have to leave a few months later, is of little interest for an employer. So, he can not get a good position before having fulfiled his obligations towards the nation. The military service forces the young man to postpone the beginning of his professional career but also of his starting a family. As a matter of fact, it seems impossible for him to get married and to have children if he has to stay away from home for one year.
This is not the case for the soldier, which has chosen to replace that waste of time by an enlistment of at least two years. Indeed, as he has a fixed salary, he meets the conditions set by our society to get married, to buy a flat or a house and to get children. So, if he wants it, his dreams can be partly realized. This enlistment in the army could be seen as an ideal solution but we have to keep in mind that the soldier often has an equipment out-of-date and that his pay is far from being high. These two disadvantages could be easily suppressed by putting an end to the compulsory militray service, that is, as it has already been said, expensive.
Thus the suppression of the military service would please a huge number of young men and would result in the formation of a smaller but beter equiped, and beter paid army. No doubt that the new army rid of the dead body of the militia should be more efficient. That is why I think that the army should consist entirely of professional soldiers.

This is still very true today. Your position in the world does not always depend on your capacity or your worth, but often on your ability to impose yourself.
A lot of people are graduate from a university but it does not mean that they have the same chances in life. Nowadays, you need something more than knowledge; this world is a world of selling and if someone wants to achieve something, they must be able to sell either their ideas or, in the worst, themselves.
Honesty does not always pay and people learn that very soon: which pupil has never noticed that their work was as good as their neighbour's one but less appreciated because they did not smile so often to the teacher? These things hurt but they only reflect on a smaller scale what is going on in our society.
Even if two people have the same intelligence, the choices they will make will influence their future chances ""to become someone"". If one out of two children does not go to a secondary school and then to university, it is usually thought that they miss some opportunities. On the one hand, it is true that a lot of jobs will never be accessible to them because a degree is required. But on the other hand, if the graduate person is shy or not self-confident enough, they will also fail at obtaining these jobs. Another thing is that the non-graduate person can be very ambitious and build their own business: in that case, no degree is required and their success merely depends on their capacities.
Another important thing to succeed in life is your connections: it is always helpful to have influential friends.
I guess it has always been so but it is nevertheless unfair to see some ordinary people at the top of a great business only because they know the right people. Whereas some other very talented persons waste their talents because they can only count on themselves. A lot of people are enrolled in a political party because that party is ""the one who could help them"", it is always difficult to know exactly who believes in their party and who expects to profit by it. This is also made clear very early to the people and many political parties gain a lot of votes thanks to that situation. Some parties even organize special meetings for students to whom they expose all the advantages they could have if they would only make common cause with them! A very interesting question would be to know who profits the more by these circumstances: the political parties or the students? And does everybody get what they longed for? But that should be developed in another essay.
This may be a dark presentation of what should be done to have an interesting life or job, but it illustrates quite well the ideas, the fears and the prejudices that students generally have when they are about to enter the so-called ""real life"". If this does not correspond to reality, maybe it is up to our professors, parents, connections, as well as to the programs on TV (which are supposed to help us in having a realistic view of life) to explain to us what this life is really about, then.

FRUL1006,2.0,2.0,,,,,Most university degrees are theoretical and do not prepare students for the real world. They are therefore of very little value,"
First of all, I would like to present the different elements of my argumentation about the title of this essay: the first part of the title refers to a very critical interpretation of the university in its fundamental function, i.e. the education of the students' mind. The second part of it represents a sharp critic on the university diploma. I will first introduce my as objective as possible vision of the university and of its most important aspects, and then I will argue on the sentences which form the title of this essay.
The university is indeed a place where the student learns most of the time only theory about whatever subject he chose, and that causes damage for his professional future: it means that this institution gives him in fact very little opportunities to apply his knowledge in very practical circumstances. But it nevertheless gives him the chance of having a good diploma, though he has to acquire some experience later. A university diploma is very well considered among the professional circles and even though he lacks practical experience, the student who has such a diploma has greater chances to be offered a interesting job than someone who has done another type of scholarship. That's one of the reasons why the university degrees have so much success, I think. Only mentioning the possession of a university diploma represents something ""more"" than another diploma from whatever school.
I am thus convinced that the university prepares our future professional life better than the titles tells us.
Because no one can obtain a better job than when he or she has a university diploma. However, the employers now ask more than a theoretical diploma: what is interesting... and required is a great amount of ""feeling"", of energy, of willingness to work in teams, etc... All that cannot be acquired when going to the university. In some small faculties, however, it is often the case with conversation classes or with other courses when a collaboration between a few people is required. When a teacher asks his students to work in groups, I think he wants to make them aware of the difficulty of having not to work on one's own.
I could give plenty of other examples to testify my ideas, but I would also like to comment the second part of the title: ""(The university diplomas) are therefore of very little value.""
I don't think this is a very realistic view of the situation or then, I am very idealistic to think that my diploma will gonna lead me to a very good job for the rest of my life!
Maybe I am very optimistic about my future and maybe I am also very idealistic, but I am nevertheless convinced that my university diploma will lead me to get a job I like and I am also sure that whatever choice one makes, there will always be a opportunity to have a very successful professional life if one goes to the school of one's choice, university or somewhere else.

FRUL1007,3.0,3.0,,,,,"Some people say that in our modern world, dominated by science and technology and industrialisation, there is no longer a place for dreaming and imagination. What is your opinion?","
I would like to begin my essay with a quotation from Conrad's Heart of Darkness where the narrator says that . It seems to me that this statement fits more with the reality of our times.
It is true that science, technology and industrialisation bring about an evolution towards more rationalism. In their daily life, people are confronted with a stressful world in which money making is what matters. One may think that it is an obsessing down-to-earth concern, but could you find another way out? We cannot help reasoning in terms of money, since we need it. And in order to come to that money, some people do not hesitate to get rid of burdensome fellows. Nonetheless, it must be acknowledged that the access to that so important money has been made easier thanks to the technological discoveries. The problem is that less and less people can see the colour of money. We long for it, but we cannot touch it. A kind of gap seems to have developed between the unemployed and the rest.
This may sound a litle bit manichean but so it seems. We now sort of live ""together apart"", in a society sharing the same ground but moving in separate worlds. Even within those worlds, people are recreating new microcosoms. What is frightening is that we are often reluctant to cross the borders of our little worlds. Technology may have accelerated the rhythm of life, bY which people have no more time to have a chat with their neighbours, but I am not too sure that this communication problem is new. I would rather believe that this issue has always existed. Let's say that the situation has sharpened and that we are further alienating from one another. Given that we are willingly trapped in the tiny spaces we have created, language seems to have become useless. I admit that I am exaggerating, but if you read some postmodernist novels, you will notice that language turns out to be a means of non-communication. Let's not forget though, that the point of language is just to communicate, and speaking a language does not always mean that people do. In this respect, there is a song by Christy Moore in which she says that . You might think that I have made digresions, but what I want to show is that in spite of the existence of a means of communication, people sometimes encounter difficulties in finding someone to speak to. Do we want to live on a deserted island, like Robinson Crusoe? I fear that most of us could not stand it. So, where can we take refuge? Dreams could do, couldn't they? I can hardly believe that people can ever have stopped dreaming, and anyway you cannot help dreaming. Whatever the epoch you live in, the political or social events you must undergo, your dreams survive. They do not care about space and time. They are your secret garden where no one can come into, the place where you can shelter shamelessly, without being afraid of other people's look. They are the only thing you possess and that nobody can steal you. As far as the imagination is concerned, I wonder if artists or the man in the street are less imaginative than before. Television, for example, is said to reduce children's ability to imagine. Thay may be treu but I hope that kids are not watching their small screen away. Do you know children who never go out to play with their friends? Honestly, I don't and that is fine.
To conclude, I would say that science, technology and industrialisation certainly stand in the way of human relationships but not in people's dreams and imagination. To come back to Conrad and strike a quite negative note, I would say that we should be aware that ""we live, as we dream - alone..."" Fortunately enough, we still live and we still dream.
It is up to us to decide weter we intend to go on living like that, that is alone and lonely, or weter we want to search for some one to share our dreams with.

Nobody can contest that at the end of the 20th century, our whole civilization is dominated by technique and industrialisation. Since the industrial revolution, the tremendous progresses realized by science have disrupted our habits and our ways of living. Its material benefits are obvious: improvement of our living standarts and prolongation of life, disappearance of hunger in the world,... In the contrary, in countries where the technical development doesn't exist or is unsufficient (for example in Somalia or Ethiopia) reign malnutrition, illness, misery and analphabetism. There is no place for Icarus' dream... Our lot is much more enviable than the one of those remote countries of Africa. But how much do we have to pay for this material comfort, this unceasing run after progress?
During centuries man has been subject to the law of nature. The modern man dominates nature; the problem for him is not so much to adapt himself to it but to the technical setting he has created. We live in the reign of automation, electronics, robots and computers. In front of his screen he communicates where he wants to, as quickly as he wants to.
And the Earth is no longer enough for him: he conquers the Space. The moon is no longer the inviolate planet, accomplice to his love affairs during a summer night but a celestial resort of the earth.
On earth America and Asia are almost next door for us and at every hour of the day or of the night electronics weaves as lightning between the continents a multitude of bounds.
What is left for dream, imagination in a world where nothing more is accessible?
Fairies, enchanters are now called computer, television, spatial rocket. In this utilitarist society the key word is speed, synonym of productivity.
Man is so organized that all his activities have for purpose to increase material satisfactions.
These conquests of progress threaten our secret garden, the poetic field of our dreams, our imagination.
And though is it reasonable to affirm that in this modern world, there is no longer a place for dreaming and imagination?
Man is more than an animal. The satisfaction of material needs is not enough for him. He needs to transcend himself, to escape from our world through dreams and imagination. He symbolizes his emotions in the form of art, music, theatre. The scientific 20th century is not less rich than the previous ones in the artistic field.
I think of the Novel whose remarkable creations are numerous and satisfy our imaginary, ouR need of escape. Cinema has also its numerous adepts and the technical prowesses of images transport the spectator in a fairy world. Here technique is in our imagination's service.
In our everyday life, we all need to have intimate moments with ourselves. A balanced life keeps for itself a part of dream to distract itself from the stress and the material requirements of everyday life. That is the language of the heart and it is necessary to everyone.
Scientists and scholars know it too: Pascal, the mathematician; Pasteur, the biologist, Schweitzer, the physician, were goodhearted men, poets or musicians.
I'll go further: scientific progresses suppress (more and more) hard work, they liberate man and provide him with leisures which are favourable to his personal opening. By contributing to his intellectual blooming and to his ""well-being"", technique preserves and refines the field of dreams and imagination. It orientates human work to Creation, Invention, it makes Icarus' or Prometheus' dream possible.
Far from approving the opinion which was proposed, I""ll say in conclusion that technique is not a fatality that should end with the degradation of man. It has carried him away in the implacable cycle of productivity, produce and material profit.
But it has especially transformed him spiritually and socially to a more human opening where dream and imagination have their necessary place.

FRUL1013,3.0,3.0,,,,,Most university degrees are theoretical and do not prepare students for the real world. They are therefore of very little value,"
Universities have always been considered as myths. But, nowadays, the situation is changing and evolving very quickly.
Does this mean that people become more realistic? Not so long ago, universities were not at everybody's level, just because those studies were very expensive and only wealthy people could have access to those famous institutions. As a matter of fact, the few people who had university degrees dominated those who had no degrees at all, but also those who had non-university ones. In such a society, the quality of a university degree had more value than degrees from other high schools. This was not a sound situation because the society was then too elitist and only priviledged people could get the chance to build up their future.
Now that this problem of elitism has been sorted out, a new one appears. Indeed, now that almost everybody has access to university thanks to grants and so on, university degrees are becoming less and less valuable. However people, some years ago, thought that a university degree could give the certainty to get a good, well-paid job, it is no longer the case today.
More and more academics go on the dole. How is this possible?
Well, there are two main reasons to explain that situation. The first one is that there are at the moment too many academics on the market, so that the demand exceeds the supply. But the main reason is that university degrees are too theoretical and thus, they ""do not prepare students for the real world"". The training which students receive at university has, of course, nothing to do with what they will have to face while working. We must not forget that learning things and being able to apply them to everyday-life situations are two different things. Most academics are self-confident when they receive their degree and feel completely lost when they have to take initiatives or to face unexpected situations. And this, just because theoretical books do not explain how to react in such circumstances.
Everybody should ask himself the following questions: ""Is there a way to change this situation?"", ""Is there no possibility to improve the training that academics receive from their first study-year on?"" Well, according to me, the first and most urgent thing to do is to emphasize practical training. By this I mean that if we compare universities with any other schools, we see immediately that there is a big difference in the way both institutions organize their studies. Indeed, when we study at university, it is only in the last academic year that we have access to practical trainings, whereas other institutions organize training periods much more earlier. It would also be a good idea to make sure that students understand what they study by asking them questions or by trying to make them think a lot by themselves. Students must pay attention not to become theory-swallowers!
In order to become profitable in our jobs, we have, first of all, to be interested in what we are doing and to go on learning many things to enlarge our knowledge. The qualities which academics often lack are: a critical approach, flexibility and the capacity to adapt themselves to unexpected situations. It is not only the university which causes this lack of training; each individual must learn to be responsible for his own future.
We, academics, have to do our best and take our future in hand.
We are masters of our lives. So, let's take profit of all the knowledge that universities can offer us but, please, let's not be invaded by all that theory. Our future depends on it. And our life is worth trying.

FRUL1015,2.5,2.0,,,,,"In his novel ""Animal Farm"" George Orwell wrote ""All men are equal but some are more equal than others"". How true is this today?","
I do not think George Orwell was very serious when he invented this phrase (he was maybe drunk??). It is quite clear that such a statement could only appear in a novel, that is to say in a work of fiction. In the real world, of course, everybody knows that all men are equal. Equality is even one of the most important values in our modern world: even if you live in a very small country such as Kuwait, you may be sure that your rights (or is it your oil?) will be defended by most of the other nations... and if you live in Croatia with your wife, who has just been raped by Serbian soldiers, you will undoubtedly receive commiseration and moral support from people all over the world. As you can see, it is quite meaningless to say that some people might be more 'equal' than others.
In fact, this mentality is quite easy to understand: we are living in a world where everybody's aim is to survive; we are all aware of the fact that our neighbours may have problems but we do not want to be implicated in a situation from which we have nothing to gain. During the Gulf War, George Bush was very proud of being the defender of international order, but once confronted with the Yugoslavian problem, justice did not seem to be his leitmotiv any more. In a world where oil seems to have become more important than human beings, how would it be possible to dream about equality?
Of course, there is not only an international problem: within our civilized western society, the situation is just the same.
Equality is a beautiful dream but it also seems to be totally outdated. Though, the majority of us pretends to see no evil, to hear no evil and to smell no evil... What a pity to see how people judge their neighbours without even trying to know them.
Racism is, of course, the clearest evidence of these ""a priori judgements"". Usually, people are not judged because of what they are but because of what they seem to be. I think everybody will agree with me if I say that equality is something very important but the fact is that we are living in a society which has its own rules. It is a system which imposes its standards of beauty, color and behaviour. In order to please people, you do not have to be perfect, you just have to pretend to be what everybody wants you to be.
As far as I am concerned, I think that every man should assume what he is and what he wants to be. It would be a first step.
We should also try to be as tolerant as possible: differences should be accepted and regarded as the characteristics of free individuals. In order to conclude, I want to quote this passage from a well-known sketch by a French humorist: When God decided to create human beings, he decided they should all be different; there would be black and white people, beautiful and ugly people, slim and fat people...
He also decided that life would sometimes be difficult...
especially for the blacks who were fat and ugly...

FRUL1016,3.0,3.0,,,,,Most university degrees are theoretical and do not prepare students for the real world. They are therefore of very little value,"
If it is true that most university degrees are theoretical and do not therefore prepare students for the real world where a young person is often required to be twenty-five years of age but in the same time to have at least five years of experience in the field to get a particularly well-paid job. And although we all know from our personal experience that a university degree is not always the key to stable employment and future prosperity, I nevertheless think that a university education is of great value.
I am not trying to be laudatory, I do not think that I would be honest to myself if I did, being aware as I am of all the shortcomings of our educational system. What I simply mean is that the four-year battle we engage in when we decide to go to university, with its little joys and its often much greater disappointments, at least obliges us to find our own way to cope with everyday life responsibilities such as the maintenance of our own housing, the balancing of our budget...
More importantly, this struggle helps us to develop our capacity of understanding our society and that of others.
I think that this last point is very important, because in a few years, we will be in charge of this society in which we were born and grew up. It seems obvious to me that subjects such as history, sociology and even philosophy, those rather bookish and for certain students boring parts of the curriculum can be of great help to govern our society in a way that will lead it to progress. One must know one's past and culture, if one is to learn from them and their mistakes.
Another important skill one must very quickly acquire, if success is to be at the end of the battle is what I will call, having found no better word to express what I mean, adaptability. For if we arrive at university with all our teenager dreams of freedom and hopes of respect for our individual ideas and opinions, reality soon reasserts itself and we are reminded that, as the saying goes: ""The Boss is always right."" Reminded also that great individual ideas should maybe wait for a little while longer. In the hope that one day, we may finally be enough of our own boss to express them.
The message sent out by the teaching staff at university has in fact many things in common with what you can hear on the place of work when working during the summer and this message could be summarized like this: try to develop your ability to think by yourself but since I do know much more about the world than you do, I reasonably feel that you should think like me.
This realization of our limitations and the awareness that the affirmation of our individuality at all costs is often not the best path to follow if one wants to be successful, are two rather unpleasant but I guess valuable skills which can prevent us from running into trouble with a boss, collegues or any kind of authority. So you have to quickly learn to adapt yourself to the present circumstances and although I see that this is the best way to live in a society, I often feel that it is not quite fair.
Even though we do not acquire much practical knowledge of the world (in the course of our studies), we do learn to see the shortcomings of society and its institutions. Individual thinking is after all what enables a man to be a responsible citizen, a good worker, a caring parent. Individual thinking is the faculty which should prevent such atrocities as those of the Second World War from happening. I am not trying to obliterate that we are all influenced by the society and the system of values we live in. But this is why the capacity of making up one's mind on other bases than the current ideas, clichs or prejudices should be developed even earlier in childhood.
So even if most university degrees are theoretical and do not give us the education we hoped it would provide us with, I think that one cannot deny that it helps us to become better human beings, better prepared citizens, but most of all, beings who will be able to learn and adapt themselves because of their awareness that human knowledge is always limited.

FRUL1018,4.0,,,,,,"In his novel ""Animal Farm"" George Orwell wrote ""All men are equal but some are more equal than others"". How true is this today?","
Before discussing the relevance of this statement, it is important to put it back in the context of the novel Animal Farm. This farmyard fable which was published in 1945 does not only satirize Russian communism but it also underlines the excesses of any kind of totalitarianism. The animals of the farm manage to chase Farmer Jones away. Then the pigs progressively seize power and they cunningly establish a regime of terror. By means of propaganda, the leaders turn the original commandments which formed the mottos of the revolution into totalitarian absolutes. One of those revolutionary commandments ""All animals are equal"" is modified by the clause ""but some are more equal than others"". This slogan eventually becomes the single commandment of the community. The dream of those animals, which wanted to put an end to their unbearable living conditions by establishing a regime of democracy, is transformed into another absolute of tyranny. One of the pigs indeed manages to impose his views by a cunning manipulation of language. When we learn that this pig which squeals louder than the others is called Napoleon, it reminds us of another revolution in the name of liberty, equality, fraternity, which led to the Terror and to the Empire.
There are lots of examples which support the thesis of the absence of a complete equality between human beings.
A first example clearly illustrates this: the notion of equality in the communist system. In the nineteenth century, Karl Marx realized that the people under the tsarist regime were kept into subservience by a mighty elite. The adequate system would be the communist regime with no class and no State, i.e. an absolute form of egalitarianism. The establishment of such a system required a class struggle and the appropriation of the means of production by the proletariat. But the communist society such as Marx described is proved to be a Utopia. Those ideas led to the dictatorship of the working class and a new division in classes within the working class itself, with the privileged on the one hand and the less privileged (it's a euphemism) on the other hand. For several years, a lot of Eastern countries have tried to get rid of communism. In the former U.S.S.R., Mikhail Gorbachev tried to move towards democracy without doing away with the communist system. Today, Boris Yeltsin strives towards the same purpose as his predecessor, i.e. a free enterprise economy and a democratic system, but he wants to achieve it by doing away with communism. As a consequence, he is criticized by the other politicians who are reluctant to lose the privileges they had obtained during the golden age of the system. That is why they even try to dismiss him.
A second example illustrates the aforementioned thesis. The seventh article of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights is explicit: . This article is not always fully respected. If we take the example of the infamous ""affaires ligeoises"", we may wonder why some influential politicians are handled with kid gloves and why the procedure lasts so long.
A third example reinforces the idea expressed above: the situation of women in the Catholic Church. It is once more written in the New Catechism of the Catholic Church that only a man (vir) can become a priest. Indeed, the Catholic Church wants to follow the example of Jesus Christ who had chosen men (viri) to constitute the group of the twelve Apostles. That is why the ordination of women is not possible. In the twentieth century, the position of women in the Catholic Church is not better than in the Middle Ages. Laywomen are respected because the society has evolved but the door is still closed for a woman who would like to become a priest.
After all these examples, we may wonder if equality really exists. Human beings seem to be equal before natural phenomena such as death, but not necessarily before life. Indeed, it is still a fact that a human being is determined by his (or her) birth. It is only possible to find an example of real equality in a field where human beings do not intervene. Any group needs a structure to function normally and to avoid anarchy and chaos. As soon as there is a structure, there are rulers and ruled. Once you have reached that stage, privileges are likely to appear and real equality is likely to disappear.
As a conclusion, we may ask the following question: is equality really possible or is it a concept invented by human beings?
Equality may be an ideal or a Utopia but all men and women should try hard to approach this ideal as close as possible.

FRUL1019,3.5,3.0,,,,,"In his novel ""Animal Farm"" George Orwell wrote ""All men are equal but some are more equal than others"". How true is this today?","
When you look at the so-called primitive societies, you notice a certain equality amont the tribe: people's tasks are distributed according to their ability to provide for the basic needs of the community. Therefore, the notion of property hardly exists. There are of course differences between them: some are more intelligent, cunning, others are stronger, but these qualities are used for a collective purpose. However, this equality is relative: it is only valid for healthy and productive people, ill people being put aside.
In civilized societies, we try to help underprivileged people.
Since we are not all the son of Croesus or we do not all possess the strength of Goliath or the intelligence of David to face life, we make up for this natural inequality with laws, in front of which everybody could be equal. This is the aim of the declaration of human rights or the U.N.O.
However, this equality is once again relative, sometimes even not present at all. We observe a clear gap between the North and the South of the planet, the South becoming poorer and poorer, as it is exploited as a source of raw material for the North. Perhaps because we do not want to give developing countries a chance, they are not able to integrate into our world of competition, in which the power is in the hands of the rich. They are bound to die of starvation or from disease as in Ethiopia.
Within civilized and technological societies, we could have hoped for a greater equality, but we are quickly disappointed: such a society only accepts strong, clever and profitable people, it cannot stand losers. This idea is illustrated in sport, where the winner - and there has to be only one - gets twice as much as the loser, even if it is for hundredth of a second in athletics, or for a ball which rolls on the net and by chance falls on the right side in tennis. Sportsmen are trained to win, and everything is allowed: brutal strength like Schumacher who knocked down the French attacker, or tricks such as Maradona's ""God's hand"" or Ben Johnson doping himself.
Another good example is the business world. Here, we can find the same situation as in sport, but the system is still worse: anonymity reinforces the power of money by reducing individual responsibilities and consequently, the risk of being legally or morally disapproved. We may even wonder if ethics still plays a role at such a level. The expressions in French ""socit anonyme"" (limited company) or ""socit  responsabilits limites"" (limited liability company) show it clearly, as well as the multinational companies ruled by an organization that is difficult to check and can transfer its capital wherever and whenever it wants to. Economic and military power takes first place as we could see during the Gulf War.
Absolute equality does not exist, since each human being is different and unique. We might therefore expect a greater equality in front of the law in more civilized societies than a mere ""struggle for life"". But man because of his intelligence manages to provide for essential needs and recreates an invisible jungle full of traps, where everyone fights for himself without caring for the others, where the most cunning and the strongest dominates the others, where the poorest loses his identity, where money is the only guarantee for rights and freedom.

FRUL1021,3.0,2.0,,,,,Most university degrees are theoretical and do not prepare students for the real world. They are therefore of very little value,"
In my essay, I will deal with the third topic: ""most university degrees are theoretical and do not prepare students for the real world. They are therefore of very little value"".
The university has always been considered in the past as a guarantee of high social status and of well-paid vacation. Now, if we look at it from an economic point of view, we have to admit that things have changed. At the moment, there are actually much less vacancies than candidates. If people go to the university nowadays, it is not to be sure to find a good job anymore, but just to acquire more general knowledge and enrich their personality.
Sometimes it is useful to have such a general education, but sometimes it is not! I have read somewhere that forty percent of young people in the United States began higher education, but that only ten percent of them were able to find a good and interesting occupation. The other thirty percents are on the dole, or have to carry on a job for which they do not need such a diploma. For example, they have to work as salesmen, employees or handworkers. Europeans say it is shocking, but the same problem is beginning to develop on our continent too!
We are living in a sort of ""learned society"" where you always have to learn more about everything. But is it not man's duty to develop his abilities as much as possible?
Some people say that studies should last longer, in order to prepare us better for our future vacation. In fact, I am not sure at all that a lengthening of the duration of studies would change anything. Things are changing so quickly nowadays that we have to be able to foreseen what kind of people will be needed in four or five years, what kind of jobs they will have to be prepared for, what kind of qualities will be expected of them,... .
Another problem is that it has become almost impossible to keep practising the same job for years without having to ""recycle yourself"" once or twice or even more. You have to adapt yourself to the new technologies, the new mentalities,... . In short, you have to be flexible, and your training has to be permanent. There is a form of ""recycling"" program called ""recurrent education"". It is meant for working people, and these have to attend university courses again in order to keep informed of the new methods, the new technologies, the new problems,... .
It is clear that academics are not well prepared for the real world. The fact is that they are trained for a specific vacation; an accountant does not have to study philosophy for example. And still it can be useful to be trained in more than one field. Someone who is constantly in contact with other people in the context of his work, like an engineer for example, has to know a bit of psychology too! From now on, the university must thus be considered as a basic training, nothing more. Practice makes perfect!
A last thing I want to add is that I do not agree with you when you say that university degrees are of very little value. From a human point of view they are worthless, I admit, but not from an economic point of view! There are many employers indeed who prefer to take on academics rather than people with a lower diploma, or worse, people with no diploma at all.
To conclude, I will just say that we have to be careful because our society is becoming a real jungle where the strongests (that is, the ones with the more diplomas) always win!

FRUL1022,3.0,2.5,,,,,"Some people say that in our modern world, dominated by science and technology and industrialisation, there is no longer a place for dreaming and imagination. What is your opinion?","
First of all, I must admit that this title confused me a little bit when I read it. The reason is that I am of a pessimistic nature and my opinion about our modern society is often very negative. But the idea that dreaming and imagination have no longer a place in our industrialized world is wrong. I think that it is completely the contrary and I will try to demonstrate why.
The ability to produce new and original ideas, and to forget reality for a while existed already in the antiquity. The origins of imagination, dream, fancy and creativity come from the fact that human beings are never satisfied with their condition. Give them the thing that they desire and they will immediately formulate another wish. Nevertheless, the difference with the past is that nowadays, people can realize their dreams more easily, thanks to science technology and industrialisation. If your dream is to visit Egypt and if you can afford it, any airline company will take you there in less than five hours.
Moreover, radio and television stimulate our minds by showing us sandy beaches, topless models, exceptional cars, reckless stuntmen and powerful athletes. Fifty years ago, this was still impossible. In general, our grandparents had a lot of work and the living conditions of the time did not favour relaxation and leisure. Today, the physical and spiritual welfare of the young gives free rein to their fantasy. But whereas the first step on the moon seemed magic, the prospect of living in space does not amaze them anymore. Of course, they admire the performance of the researchers but they are not really aware of its pecularity. And perhaps that tomorrow, astronomy and basketball will be placed on an equal footing.
The influence of technology on our brains is obvious but you must know that the contrary is also true. Imagination and creativity are very close to each other and the world would not develop, grow,... live if man were not able to invent new things everyday. The first step in medical research is usually a thought processes. The scientist imagines an unreal situation, dreams of a technique which does not exist yet.
After this, he has to experiment it and prove its efficiency.
For the moment, doctors are tirelessly racking their brains and going into hypotheses in order to discover a vaccine against AIDS.
I think that life would be sorrowful if human beings had not got the capacity to fantisize. In fact, we do it all the time, consciously or unconsciously, in order to relax. Otherwise, the stresses and strains of modern life would be almost unbearable.
Dreams are means of evasion, they give us the opportunity to transform the real oppressive world into something wonderful, into a kind of heaven on earth where war, famine, corruption and injustice have no chance to survive.
In conclusion, dreaming and imagination occupy a larger place in our modern society than we realize. So, never tell me that you do not dream because I would not believe it.

FRUL1023,3.0,2.0,,,,,"Some people say that in our modern world, dominated by science and technology and industrialisation, there is no longer a place for dreaming and imagination. What is your opinion?","
I think that this statement is true. In order to bear out this point of view, I will first sketch the current relations between the concepts imagination and industrialisation in our modern world and then I will try to find a possible way out of this current situation.
Our modern consumer society, which is the result of a long industrialisation process, has become less and less human. I'm using here the word ""human"" because it perfectly fits with dreaming and imagination which are two typical human characteristics.
Since the end of the nineteenth century, our western society has been investing in human resources mainly based on sheer human physical strength; millions of workers have been working for a few crafty - and soon becoming wealthy - businessmen. As a result of this, we're now living in a world in which the key words are efficiency, production, competition or performance.
Not only the economy has been stifling our way of life, but the resulting higher standards of living and a still increasing administration of our western nations have also contributed to an alienation from all that is human.
The problem is that dreaming and imagination have become too futile to get a respectable place in our modern world. In fact, dreaming and imagination are a matter of education; everybody has potentialities to make something of them, but our educational systems don't give many possibilities to the practice of whatever form of creativity.
As a first conclusion, one can state that dreaming and imagination are being completely neglected while most of the available money from the public utilities is being spent for economic purposes. So, why are dreaming and imagination so important, and how could they take a more important place in our society?
I think that they are important because they are part of what makes a man a human being. Man's intelligence enables one single person to walk on the moon; so, why couldn't it be possible to enable everyone to have the opportunity of being creative?
When referring to creativity or imagination, I'm thinking of a further development of one's intellectual abilities, with the stress put on the understanding of the world and its inhabitants. I'm convinced that this is a crucial point concerning the abilities of a human being. Indeed, once these creative faculties are exploited, they can help to solve many problems inherent in mankind.
In relation to this, one can - unfortunately - state that not even someone who has been to university may claim to be fully intellectually developed.
Through dreaming and imagination, one can free the mind; only cynicals deny this statement. Indeed, music, painting, sports or whatever ""useless"" activities are ways of opening one's mind; when children play at soldiers, they don't fight; when teenagers play football, they don't cheat.
All this remains true until money comes into play.
Of course, life is not a game; our society has to ""work"" in order to give everyone some bread, some butter, some milk, a car, one or two televisions, a video recorder and a compact-disc player. But, all these just mentioned items prove that superficial, easy entertainment is being encouraged at the expense of useful or even efficient frivolous creative activities.
I deeply believe that our society could improve by paying more attention to all that is not down-to-earth. If you learn someone to look around himself and in himself and if you help him to use his mind (not his sheer intelligence), you will certainly contribute to a better world in a better way than by giving him money to buy a third television.
So, in concrete terms, the solution to a still deshumanizing society could be to give more money to education and all that concerns ""the creative part of human beings"".
In even more concrete terms, I remain very sceptical about a soon fulfillment of this wish.
As long as the economists haven't understood that ""to be good value"" isn't the only value that matters, no one will be able to change the current situation.
In fact, isn't our world ruled by economic necessities? Yet, ""deshumanization"" should directly imply ""rehumanization"". So, don't worry! Just wait and see!

FRUL1024,3.0,2.5,,,,,"Some people say that in our modern world, dominated by science and technology and industrialisation, there is no longer a place for dreaming and imagination. What is your opinion?","
The world in which we are living is a world dominated by science technology and industrialisation. People say that we are living in a ""modern"" world, that is a world in which everything can be explained in a rational way. The fundamental question is to know wether, in such a world, there is still a place for imagination and dreaming or not. In other words: are dreaming and imagination important for the ""modern"" man?
Through this paper, I want to explain that dreaming and imagination are not only important but that they are also essential in the twentieth century.
We are living in a world in which everything is mechanized.
Indeed, everything is dominated by computers and, in many fields, human beings are also replaced by machines. Science technology and industrialisation are the ""masters"" of the modern world.
Even the children's world is touched by the technological progress. Indeed, nowhere children can be seen playing marbles, for instance, as it was the case about thirty years ago. On the contrary, nowadays children are playing with electronic games which can be compared with a kind of mini-computers.
Man wants to go so far in the field of technological development that he becomes himself a machine. I think that the only possible solutions he has in order to escape the ""prison"" of the advanced technological world are imagination and dreaming.
But does the modern man still give importance to imagination and dreaming? Or does he rather think that the right to dream belongs to dropouts, that is people who have chosen to live on the fringe of the modern society? When you look attentively at the ""world's functioning"", you will certainly adopt the second solution. An example can also be found in the children's world.
On TV, in films or even in cartoons for instance, the subjects which are dealt with are always the same: young children are looking at robots which are fighting. It is the vision children have of the future, that is a world in which everything would be replaced by computers... even human beings. But they need means in order to escape this world of machines, that is a world without life. And this means are imagination and dreaming.
Imagination and dreaming are not only necessary in our technological world but I think they have played an important role in the life of people from every time. Take for instance the minors of the nineteenth century. They were people who only knew the black walls of the mines in which they worked. They could not escape this kind of life. And for them, the only solution in order to open out new horizons was the dream.
Before ending this paper, I also want to say a word about one aspect of imagination I have not developped. I mean the human being's creative imagination. Indeed, in order to go foward in their research, people need their creative imagination. No computers can replace man's imagination. Imagination is a human quality and human beings need it... also the modern man.
As a conclusion I can say that the man could not escape this demanding world if he gave no place to imagination and dreaming in his life.

Magistrates, politicians and philosophers have been having a great controversy for centuries. The subject of the debate is the way the court deals with criminals. Lots of people think that the court is no longer living up to its name, nowadays.
They believe that the first principle of the justice system of any civilized society should be the protection of the innocent citizens: the old, the vulnerable, the weak,... But they have the impression that laws do not stop criminals. On the contrary, they help them in a way. Magistrates sometimes seem to give more consideration to the offenders than to protecting society from them. Therefore some people would like to reform the justice system. According to them the court has to answer the collective need (of the victims and also of all of us) for punishment. At that stage of the discussion, I would like to ask those questions: Is punishment the most effective solution?
Wouldn't it be better to rehabilitate criminals than to keep them in jail or to sentence them to death?
Indeed, some people consider that these are the best solutions because they make people feel a lot more better in their mind.
""Let's get rid of that !"" They would like to restore the death penalty or to threaten criminals with exemplary punishments. Personally, I am totally against both solutions which I find barbaric at a certain level. As far as imprisonment is concerned, I am no longer sure that removing people from society during any long or short period of time would help. I have the impression that if magistrates were able to send more criminals to prison, they would be increasing the problem. Lots of people who come out of prison are indeed likely to commit more offences. Moreover we have to keep in mind that imprisonment is nowadays considered as the heaviest punishment. And that is also the main argument of the opponents of imprisonment. They say that you cannot punish somebody more than he deserves. Lots of petty offenders, however, have been sent to jail. Those offenders have been punished too much.
Therefore the opponents of imprisonment try to prevent the court from going on increasing the sentences to a level that would be disproportionate to the seriousness of the kind of offence. They plan to defend the ""Rights"" of criminals by establishing degrees of punishment. Criminals have to be tried proportionally for what they have done, for their criminal responses towards society.
The purpose of the act is to restrict imprisonment to very serious offences and to keep out of prison people who are considered not to have committed such offences. Moreover the opponents of imprisonment also propose other effective penalties. They say that criminals have to be faced up to the responsibilities for what they have done and for victims. At the same time, they would like to help them to live a normal life again. They preach for forgiveness and rehabilitation.
Forgiveness is a christian duty without which you cannot reach any peace of mind. Criminals need to say ""sorry"". And they have to feel at ease in society. Therefore some people try to reintegrate them step by step. They are sent into community services, for example. They learn how to behave,... By this, social workers,... try to reduce further offences. That program is not really convincing, though. Many criminals refuse to learn anything or commit more public offences once free. Our cities are then threatened to turn into ""jungles"".
Once again we have to know where to draw the line and to establish degrees of punishment. A rape is more serious than a propriety offence, for example. Anyway, the punishment has to fit the crime not the criminal...

FRUL1027,3.0,2.5,,,,,Feminists have done more harm to the cause of women than good,"
Feminists have defended the cause of women; when they started, I would say it was necessary and I wouldn't write this today if they had not been there, simply because it was inconceivable women would have entered universities. Nevertheless, I reckon some of them - still active today - go beyond the acceptable limits and finally look ridiculous.
If we go back in time, we discover how unbearable the condition of women was. Their education stopped very early; they needn't much because they stayed at home and their work was rather manual than intellectual. But this also suited men who could impose their superiority. In fact, it was a very pleasant life for men who did not fear any rebellion from their wives since these had always learnt to be obedient (first to their parents, than to their husbands) and therefore they depended upon them for money. Of course, men were the only ones who brought money at home. At table women were reduced to silence while men enjoyed an animate conversation. Again for the same reason: their brief education did not allow them to utter something interesting, according to men.
For ages men have been considered as the possessors of truth and have been called ""the stronger sex"". Some women have tried to get rid of this domination. At the beginning their action did not go without difficulty; it is easy to understand that in a world as I have just described feminists were disturbing the order. The first ones are always blamed and are qualified as mad, revolutionary people. Men were afraid that these would influence their own wives and so they ridiculed them the most they could.
If today it seems quite normal to us to see women who have become managers, teachers,... or simply to see girls in universities, we have to thank these feminists. It was a myth to believe that women were not able to equal men intellectually.
Nevertheless I must reckon that today some feminists are really going too far, particularly as far as language is concerned.
Let's take, for instance, the word ""chairman"" which had to become ""chairperson""; this case can be legitimately defended but sometimes we come to absurdities such as willing to change every word where the letters M.A/E.M. appear as in ""menstruation"" which has nothing to do with male but comes from the Latin word ""menstruus"" (= monthly).
Another example is that feminists now recommend unmixed schools because the level in girls-classes is higher, and when girls are in a mixed class they go down to the level of boys.
How do we look today at what feminists have done? Men always have a smile on the lips when speaking about feminists. The younger generations accept it now as a fact and the notion of housewife has almost disappeared. Among older generations some completely rejected these new ideas. Others think that women are now too free; of course this was a essential change: a job means money and money means financial independence.
How women react to feminism is a different viewpoint since they are more or less involved. I think some of them (just a few) consider feminists as shameless women and do not want to be associated with them. But women cannot deny the role feminists have played in order to better their condition. Women had to show that they were not (sex) objects at the mercy of men but the problem is that you always have to go extreme in order to improve sufficiently. Anyway I think it would be too easy to criticize when we can benefit from their efforts. Now, instead of reducing feminism to ridiculous details in our countries, it would be better to defend the cause of women in other places in the world especially in African and developing countries where the condition of women is almost inconceivable for us.

FRUL1029,3.5,3.0,,,,,"Some people say that in our modern world, dominated by science and technology and industrialisation, there is no longer a place for dreaming and imagination. What is your opinion?","
The era called ""Prehistory"" corresponds with a period when men and women had not discovered science yet. Their ""technology"", as we might call it, consisted mainly of tools which they made with their hands. Since they did not understand many things which happened around them, they tried to explain the inexplicable events through magic. Fire, for instance, was one of these enigmas they could not master and therefore was soon to be given a magical power.
Then followed the Greek and Roman civilizations, which were already much more aware of the scientific phenomena. They knew about mathematics and astronomy. They could control fire but still believed in gods, whom their imagination made act according to the events that they could not understand. A storm and lightnings, for instance, were said to be one of Jupiter's angers. The traces of these beliefs are to be found in literature and especially in one of the books about Greek mythology: The Iliad and the Odyssee.
The Middleages were not so much important in terms of beliefs and imagination: people were afraid of dragons and witches and, in order to protect themselves, were strong believers in Christ and God.
The Renaissance, on the contrary, is for me more important. It is the period when Man rediscovers himself, when science begins to make its first steps but paradoxically, people like Copernic and Galileo, who were real scientists, and who worked with experiments and had proofs, were considered as people whose fantasy and imagination had driven mad.
Since the Renaissance, our society has kept discovering the world's scientific reality: there are much fewer events that seem inexplicable to us and, moreover, we are now able to create these events artificially, in laboratories. We are able to make cells multiply, we can control the growth of plants, we can analyse genes and understand how heredity works, we are able to understand what light is made of and we are even able to go and walk on the moon! But scientific progress also has a bad side. Remember the birth of the Nobel Prize: a certain Mr Nobel, who invented dynamite to help building railways, was so afraid of the way people used it (in wars...) that his last will was to honour scientists, politicians, writers, etc... who made ""good"" discoveries or who helped our society somehow or other. The human brain is also the father of the H-bomb, which destroyed thousands of lives in Hiroshima-Nagazaki and which is now used as the ""supreme threat"".
Is there a place for dreaming and imagination? Yes, because now people imagine infinity. They dream on a larger scale since they know their world better: their dreams can penetrate cells or go further than the moon. The extremely small and the extremely big are now parts of our reality. But dream can also turn into nightmare when we think about all the ""bad"" discoveries of science. Horror films and science fiction films or books are enough pieces of evidence for the trial of science.

FRUL1030,3.0,3.0,,,,,The prison system is outdated. No civilized society should punish its criminals: it should rehabilitate them,"
I don't agree with the second sentence. I think criminals should be punished more harshly and in an other way than they are now. Nowadays, lawyers always manage to convince juries that the criminal's behaviour is due to a particular event in their life, or that they didn't have a happy youth, the father being always drunk and the mother having fled away or the contrary. I think this is too far fetched. Every human being has to be responsible for his acts, and people who aren't should be placed in special institutions. Lawyers and judges often tend to take the side of the criminals in spite of the side of the society which should be protected from such people.
Because it is always possible to find something that may have disturbed someone's subconscious, all criminals can then take advantage of extenuating circumstances. This is crazy. The best way to be sure that a criminal won't act like he did is to put him in jail.
But even this isn't a good solution. Some criminals committed such awful crimes that the only sentence can be death. Not the cruel death they imposed on their victims, but death all the same, by injection for example. These criminals don't even deserve a trial. Of course, this can only be done if everybody knows he is the one who committed these crimes. I don't want an arbitrary system to replace the one we have now.
 can be read in ""Hamlet"". There is something rotten in our judicial system too. This one needs to be reformed, so that serious measures can be taken against all kinds of criminals.
In Belgium, some paedophilia affairs have recently been judged, one of them implying a cleric and two of his friends. These three men just got three or four years sentence. This is a shame. Those men perverted children and don't get punished for it. Three or four years in prison cannot be considered as a punishment which is proportionnal to the crime. The children will have to live with a traumatism and this may influence their future sexual relations. Their life may become a hell on earth. The sentence for the three men should have been life sentence, if not death. I our system doesn't get reformed, criminality won't stop rising.
The department of justice itself needs reforms. I'm sure some people there are hiding things to help ""friends"". In Belgium again, we have the ""van der Biest affair"", which is linked to the ""Cools affair"". It is surprising to see how many times documents disappeared in supposedly locked and guarded rooms.
An internal inquiry is needed. When our system will be cleared of all the corrupted elements, a reform of our legal institutions will then be possible.
But to rehabilitate criminals is to put a monk in a bed between two sisters. The temptation will be too great for him because he knows he won't be punished. You may not expect from a criminal that he will think about the reasons why he hasn't been punished. ""Normal"" people, who are not criminals, would think that the fact of not sending a criminal to jail will make him think about what he has done and change his behaviour. But if these men are criminals, they are not ""normal"". How could they then think like ""normal"" people?

In our society, science, technology and industrialisation have become three inseparable words. They are inevitably linked together. The sciences represent the acquired knowledge thanks to the discovery of laws and phenomena. People do not generally succeed in perceiving such a knowledge which seems out of reach. Although science and technology are part of our everyday life they remain at a level which goes beyond the human sensibility. Three conditions are needed in order to keep up with industrialisation: an important capital, available labour force and technological progress. A technological revolution took place in Europe two centuries ago and, nearer to us, we all remember the technological revolution of the seventies.
Now that people live with technology, distrust is the general attitude we adopt when we think about progress. The old, omnipotent faith in progress has disappeared. But I do not think that we will draw back. When Man makes a step he wants to go further and he will therefore make a second one.
If you tell me that because of the fact that we are living in such a society, we are no more able to dream, my opinion goes the opposite way. It is not possible to live without dreaming and imagination. Life would become so dull that we would attend an upsurge of nervous breakdowns, the most of them leading to suicide. I may sound a bit pessimistic but that is not the case.
From a medical point of view, Freud has already explained that people cannot live without dreaming otherwise their mental balance would be disturbed. Do not trust people who tell you that they do not dream: they do even if they are not aware of it.
We do not have less time for dreaming than before because in big firms man has been replaced by the machine. This is the principle of mechanization. What finished goods prices concerns: the lowest, the best because competition lays down the law. The employees have no choice: they have to get used to technology, they have to learn how to use new techniques. Their training must be almost complete before they enter the firm otherwise they will soon lag behind. There lies the problem: in trying to adapt. When you reach a certain age, it is not always easy to change your habits and to take new things in rapidly.
The life of someone who cannot get used to those techniques becomes a hell. If you have been worried the whole day, it is not easy to forget about your work when you come back home. In order to avoid the nervous breakdown, you have to overcome your problems. We all need dreaming and imagination as a kind of escape from a sometimes very dull reality. So many things can help us to dream: listening to music, reading a book, practising a sport...
Those moments are not expensive and yet, how they are precious!
Nowadays people are always in a hurry; you hear them say: ""Well, I have no time, you know..."" I think that they adopt the wrong attitude. The problem is not that they have no time but that they do not even take the time. Have you ever realized that the simple fact of thinking enables us to forget reality.
Do not tell me that a thought takes so much time.
What can we say about people during the war who kept on hoping and believing in the future? Where did they find the will to carry on when the present had nothing but gloomy prospects to offer? Although the world around them was collapsing, they must have been thinking about better days. When you are confident of something, this gives you an incredible power. We all have a purpose in life, something we want to reach, the aim for which we keep hoping. It is a way for us to give a sense to our life.
And we all know that hope implies dreaming because we only hope for things that have not yet happened.
Nothing can prevent human beings from dreaming and it is precisely when things go wrong that we tend to dream and hope for a better life. A machine does not dream; human beings do.
As a conclusion, I would like to tell people who find it difficult to escape in a world of their own that singing a song is not as stupid as people think it is. After all, does not singing always give a matter for dreaming?

FRUL1034,2.5,2.5,,,,,Feminists have done more harm to the cause of women than good,"
Nowadays few women think of themselves as feminists. The Women's Lib is out of fashion and seems to belong to a remote past. A reason for this may be that women no longer feel the need of a dramatic change, since their social, political and professional situation considerably improved over the last decades. But what have feminists actually achieved? Are there no battles left to fight? Could feminism harm the cause of women?
Up until the twentieth century most women had very few rights and opportunities. Men considered them as physically and intellectually inferior. For example in the nineteenth century a married woman was, according to the law, her husband's property and she had to give him all that she owned. Women could hardly get a divorce, although a lot of them were mistreated. They were allowed to study at Oxford and Cambridge but could not receive a degree. In factories and workhouses women worked themselves to death.
Feminism's first aim was to demonstrate that women are equal to men in all respects, which led to practical changes. The suffragettes won British women the full franchise in 1928.
Women also got the right to ask for a divorce. More and more women graduated from universities. Salaries were raised and work conditions were improved. Thanks to their higher education level women became more independent and were better equipped to fight for their rights.
However it should be thought that all women are treated as they should be. In many non-western countries women are still exploited and oppressed. Despite the Equal Pay Act 1970 and the Sex Discrimination Act 1975 in Great-Britain on the one hand and affirmative action in the United-States on the other hand, the principle of equal pay for equal work is not always applied and women find it hard to be appointed to positions of responsibility. Housewives get little social recognition, except in Scandinavia where they are paid for their work.
Feminism undoubtedly helped to improve the condition of women.
Still it cannot be denied that at times Women's Libbers go a bit too far. Some extremists would like to change the spelling of women to womyn in order to avoid the ending in -men which reminds them of the plural form of the word man. Others coin the term herstory to refer to the study of women's affairs.
They seem to ignore that the first syllable of history has etymologically nothing to do with a masculine prefix. In Germany some suggest modifying the indefinite pronoun man (one) because it sounds like Mann (man).
Feminists not only are good at making fools of themselves, but also turn out to have a gift for discrediting themselves (and women in general) in the eyes of men. Everybody knows that if one wants to be respected by someone, one has to respect that person first. Everybody except some feminists who behave so aggressively towards men that these come to consider women as frustrated pests.
Have feminists done more harm to the cause of women than good?
No, because changes were needed. But they should make sure that they keep the golden mean.

FRUL1035,3.5,2.5,,,,,The prison system is outdated. No civilized society should punish its criminals: it should rehabilitate them,"
A civilized society is a society having a highly developed social organization, a group of people having a system of laws and moral rules that makes it possible for them to live together. A civilized society should therefore do all it can to have the laws respected and bring its criminals to justice. The prison system fulfils two main functions: in the first place, it keeps dangerous people away from society, preventing them from committing other crimes; in the second place, criminals are sent to prison as a punishment after having been found guilty of an offence. One must preserve a system in which criminals are punished for their prejudicial deeds. If this kind of system was abolished, nothing would stop them from committing other offences. The criminals' fear of being caught and sent to prison is a major factor in the fight against criminality.
To deprive a human being of his freedom may be judged barbaric or unworthy of a civilized society, but we must keep in mind the fact that a society cannot function without a moral code, without a set of rules; in other words, without laws. Every organization has regulations, even schools. The aim is to ensure the maintenance of order, to enable people to live together in harmony. It is therefore justified to punish criminals. In the European countries, imprisonment is the most common form of punishment.
The deficiencies in the prison system are obvious. Life imprisonment is a very rare sentence. Criminals, after having been tried, are sent to prison to serve their sentence. But after that period of time, which can be very short, they are set free again. Nothing can guarantee that they will not reoffend and commit a subsequent crime. Recidivism is on the increase, especially among juvenile delinquents. One should keep a very close watch on them after they have been released.
The rehabilitation process should begin before criminals have left prison. Imprisonment often develops a sense of revolt in them. One should help offenders to understand and accept their prison sentence. Criminals are convinced that society is responsible for the fact that they lose a precious part of their lives in prison. They want to take vengeance on society.
This explains in part why there are so many recidivists.
The rehabilitation system also shows many deficiencies. To rehabilitate a criminal is to make him able to lead an active life again. But given the present economic prospects and the high increase of the unemployment rate in all European countries, the task of the social services which help former prisoners to find a job, is largely compromised. Many delinquents have not received a good vocational training. Their chances of being taken on without a professional qualification are very limited. A solution would be to give them the opportunity to follow courses during their imprisonment. That should be an integral part of the rehabilitation process.
Another obstacle which must be overcome, is that very few people are disposed to give criminals a second chance. They are stigmatized as such for the rest of their lives. Who would hire a former thief or a former drug addict without apprehension or anxiety? Employers give preference to applicants with an irreproachable character reference. On the other hand, if delinquents do not find a job when they are released, they tend to turn to criminality again.
I think that a distinction must be made between delinquents and murderers. Once a person has disobeyed God's commandment , he represents a permanent threat for society. He has irremediably transgressed the barriers that society imposes on the individual. In my opinion, murderers should be sentenced to death; mitigating circumstances or not. Passion is no valid excuse for taking another person's life. Sending them to a psychiatric hospital for irresponsibility or sentencing them to life imprisonment does not solve the problem at all. After having received a psychiatric treatment, they are often released for good conduct. But no one, not even a distinguished psychiatrist, can predict how they will react in society after having submitted themselves to this treatment. To me, life imprisonment could be considered as a form of mental cruelty.
The death penalty should be re-established in the countries where it has been abolished. Imprisonment brings no solution for rapers. Chemical castration, accompanied by a psychiatric treatment, should be applied to them, especially if they have raped children.
In other words, I am convinced that rehabilitation, although it is necessary or indispensable, cannot replace the prison system. The application of punishments is a means of fighting against the growing criminality. Surely, today's imprisonment system is not outdated and it will never be as long as society is based on the fundamental principles of self-defence and survival.

FRUL2002,3.0,3.0,,,,,Most university degrees are theoretical and do not prepare students for the real world. They are therefore of very little value,"
It is of course always difficult to agree with assertions as categoric as this one. But we should perhaps first examine the aim of university studies before we discuss the statement in itself.
In my opinion, it would be a mistake to consider that university studies should prepare students for the ""real world"". One goes to university -I hope- because he is interested in a particular subject and wants to know more about it. He will of course learn things that he will never need in his professional career, but you expect from a mathematician that he knows how to calculate, even if he will rely on computers in his profession. Moreover, it is sometimes very difficult to know what your degree will lead you to do in life. Someone with a degree in general medicine might become a general practitioner or a researcher; or even change several times of job in the course of his life. Therefore, if one wants university to prepare him for the ""real world"", it should only learn him to be ambivalent. The problem is now to know if it is something one can learn.
As I suggested earlier, one shouldn't expect, when going to university, to learn how to behave in life the same way as a technician can learn how to deal with a machine. In fact the most significant thing I will have learned at my university is to do things by myself. But I will deal with this point later.
An important thing to mention here is that the average length of university studies in Belgium is of four years (even three in England). In such a short period of time, it is of course impossible to get all the knowledge one will need for the rest of his life. People who have already graduated have now to retrain. If a university cannot give to someone all the knowledge he needs, how on earth could it prepare him to deal with the complexity of the ""real world""?
In fact I understand the word ""university"" as a place where one has to prove something. Of course, there are still teachers, but they are not as interested in pedagogy as secondary school teachers are. They give their lessons and it is for the students to show their ability to deal with the (most of of the time broad) subject. They have to show how they can assimilate the subject, but also how they can reorganize it, and think about it, and adapt themselves to every situation; in one word, how they can work by themselves. If they can do that, they are capable of holding a leading place in the society.
It is therefore that a university degree has a very good value and that they are praised everywhere. It is not only because you have learned something, but also because you can still learn something, because you can judge any situation rightly.
For all these reasons -and for one more- I strongly disagree with the statement I have just been discussing. My last reason is the following one: one may not consider a university degree only as a means to make money. A university is, above all, a place where you learn to think and to respect every opinion and every thing. This makes its value and the value of its degree.

FRUL2021,2.0,2.0,,,,,Most university degrees are theoretical and do not prepare students for the real world. They are therefore of very little value,"
I have chosen this topic because I am directly affected by it. In three months, I leave the university in order to begin a new life: to enter active life. In this essay, I am going to speak about my experience as a university student and about my fears concerning my future as a working woman.
University students are often regarded as ""swots""; with other words, people who are always studying without enjoying life and everything around them. But is this description of the university student real or is it only a ""clich""?
In fact, the difference between university and higher schools is the following: university gives us a theoretical education whereas higher schools are more technical oriented. So, a student who decides to go to university is already aware of that difference.
However, I think that university sometimes puts a wall between the students and the outside world. We are inundated with work and have no time to take an interest in active life. That is the reason why training courses are very interesting. Those courses give us the possibility to enter in contact with other people, especially working people. Besides, it allows us to put into practice what we are learning at school.
Let us now turn our attention to the students who want to apply for a job in the private sector. To get such a job, , they must possess a lot of qualities such as creativity, sociability, great powers of expression, a strong personality, a critical mind and they must be open-minded.
Flexibility is also an important asset. Why?
People with university degrees always have to enter in contact with the clientle. If they have to negotiate a business, they must feel what they can do and say in that particular situation. Thus, they must adopt the appropriate reaction.
Furthermore, the academic must be ready to go back to school after a few years to get used to the novelties.
In addition to the retrainings, there are other possibilities: congresses, seminars and self-training.
It is obvious to everyone that the qualities I have quoted also apply for all the other sectors.
The problem is that the employers receive hundreds of applicants for the same job. That is why they can allow to demand more and more qualifications from those students.
As we are slowly moving toward the European equivalence of the diplomas, we can assume that the knowledge of at least one foreign language is necessary to find a decent job.
To sum up, I believe that a university degree is not a garantee of success. Nevertheless, the unemployment among the academics must be relativized.
In the United Sates, white-collar workers are the principal victims of the economic crisis. In France, we count 170 000 employees among the 2.9 million redundant workers; a figure which represents an increase of 34%. A survey has revealed that industries were waiting for a better economic prospects before taking on new employees. Besides, a lot of big societies intend to reduce the hierarchic levels.
Then, we must speak about a vicious circle. In 20 or 30 years, the only possibility to become an executive will be a university degree.
This also means that the expectations will always increase.

FRUL2023,2.5,,,,,,The prison system is outdated. No civilized society should punish its criminals: it should rehabilitate them,"
Nowadays, it is scarcely possible to open a newspaper without being faced with examples of mindless violence. In almost every country, we experience a great increase in criminal activities of nearly every kind.
As a result of this, prisons are overcrowded and the humiliation suffered by their inmates makes rehabilitation very difficult. But before getting to the heart of the matter, we may question why there is such a crime wave.
In this respect, we straightaway think of factors such as unemployment, growing insecurity, which have undoubtely contributed to the present situation. But from my own point of view, what I find most striking is a decline in authority in general. People have more and more difficulties to submit themselves to authority. We notice it every day, not only at school but also at work, sporting events. Almost all actions for which a person may be punished are actions which are specifically forbidden by some statue. However, certain persons refuse to accept these sentences.
The respect of certain rules seems to me essential, otherwise we run the risk to reach anarchism. Therefore, I do not totally agree with the statement: ""the prison system is outdated"". Some people argue that no trial process can be perfect because some people have been found guilty of crimes which they did not commit, and probably some who were really guilty have been found not ""guilty"" and set free. Indeed, it is true but it is easy to concentrate on this aspect of the problem. The real question at issue is different.
In my opinion, the prison system is necessary to rebuke somebody who has commited criminal offences. However, I make a distinction between someone who has commited ""serious"" crimes and someone who did minor crimes. It is clear that a murderer has to be treated differently than a burglar for example.
Whatever their crimes, the prisoners need to be helped. Some of them are mentally disturbed and deserve a special treatment as well as medical and therapeutic aid. Moreover, the psychologists and psychiatrists of today need a great variety of skills to deal with modern crime and other problems of society. In order to restore the prisoners to a normal life, they have first to understand why they have been incarcerated.
For some of them (which represent a very small number), it is what we may call a ""chance mishap"". So far they did not have a criminal record and their imprisonment is just an accident due to special events (eg. bad financial situation, nervous breakdown). In a way, what happened to them was beyond their control. In this case, the prisoner is granted mitigating circumstances and just needs someone to put him on the right track again. But others are recidivists and their case is much more difficult to solve if not desperate.
Although each case has to be taken individually, I think we can draw a list of factors which favoured the incarceration. Most of the time, the prisoner has a limited or no schooling at all. He comes from an underpriviledged part of the population. He has already fallen foul of the law when he was a teenager. He is unemployed or inactive so that he has an image of a future without prospects. He has psychological and personal problems which he can not get rid of. He can not break bad habits.
I'm not concerned here with the vindication of the prisoners but I think that these factors have to be taken into account when dealing with the process of rehabilitation.
This process is indeed very complex. Despite all the efforts made, we can assume that there is 70% of failure. It would be nave to think that you can work wonders just because you are of good will. In my view you can only succeed in this undertaking if the prisoner is determined to get out of his situation. I must point out that it doesn't mean that he will but the readjustement is easier than with someone who is grudging.
The very structure of the prison in itself is not favourable for rehabilitation.
How can you restore someone to a normal life when he lives in a confined environment?
There are several kinds of prisons, including open ones, and some prisoners go out to work in groups outside. Prisoners who want to study for examinations are helped to do so and there are training courses in prison. But in practice some spend very little time outside their cells. Besides, they are in touch with other convicts so that they are immerged into their problems again.
They are also confronted with specific problems: nobody conceals the fact that a lot of prisoners have homosexual relationships or that there is drug trafficking inside the prisons.
They have the need for an opening onto the world but they have to stay indoors, so they remain in a vicious circle.
These problems clearly don't admit of an easy solution but it is clear that the structure of the prison system has to be reconsidered. This will not only take time but will also cost money. The question is: is society willing to commit itself to help the very same people who have rejected it?

FRUL2024,3.0,3.0,,,,,The prison system is outdated. No civilized society should punish its criminals: it should rehabilitate them,"
If we must believe our grandparents, we live nowadays in a terrible time; we have to face a tremendous wave of criminality and jails are overcrowded. But we can wonder what a prison is and what its function is in our society. According to , .
Criminals are thus incarcerated for two purposes; on the one hand, it is necessary to cut them off from the community in which they have committed their crimes, and this for the sake of this community's safety. In my eyes, the first and most important function of incarceration is indeed the protection of society. On the second hand, prisons are considered as a way of punishing criminals by depriving them of their freedom. So, they are isolated from the rest of the world for a certain number of years, according to the seriousness of the crime they have committed.
But is such an isolation of criminals really a convenient solution to the present-day outburst of violence and criminality? I do not think so. A man who has spent twenty years of his life in jail is totally disoriented when he is at last released. His twenty years of captivity have alienated him from society, which has been going on developing without him. Such a man often does not find any job because of his past as a criminal and because of his lack of experience; a criminal who has spent a long time in prison is most of the time completely out of his depth when confronted to the new situation. That is why he very soon becomes an outcast. The only way which remains open to him is thus to fall back into criminality. It is moreover well-known that during their incarceration, people often meet not very recommendable criminals who can have a bad influence on them and sometimes can 'help' them to enter a well-organized criminal network. That's why I think that we can say that our prison system is completely outdated.
Instead of making outcasts of the prisoners, the incarcerating system should progressively reintroduce them in society, so that they could have a normal social life when they go out of jail after they have served their sentence.
The prison system should be made so as to be useful to the prisoners. They should be given the possibility to learn a good job according to their natural abilities and to their preference and to acquire a certain amount of experience.
Such an enterprise would be positive at two levels: at first, it would interest prisoners in something new and helpful. Instead of brooding about their dark future prospects, they would be able to feel hopeful, which would give them a good reason to behave properly. Secondly, they would have the opportunity to keep in touch with the evolution of the outside world and to have a professional training which is adapted to the current situation.
The criminals should moreover be progressively reintroduced in society. After a certain number of years during which they should have to prove that they can behave properly, the system should provide them with a part-time job in order to put them to the test. At the beginning, the authorities should of course keep close watch over them in order to see to it that they would not represent a danger for society. During this period, they would live in special rehabilitation centres, which would form a kind of bridge between prison and normal life. The third and last stage would be the total reinsertion in society.
As I explained it, the rehabilitation process would thus be a long and progressive one but according to me, it is necessary in order to ensure the protection of society. On the other hand, this process could not fit any case. Indeed, authorities must not take the risk of reinserting a dangerous murderer in society. That is why each case should be examined separately by a special court.
Anyway, I am perfectly aware that it is much easier to imagine new systems than to put them into practice. Nevertheless, I think it is now desperately urgent to renew our prison system, which is largely outdated; it is time to find a way of rehabilitating criminals instead of cutting them off from the rest of the world. Although it may be an extremely difficult task, I think that the game is worth the candle.

ITRS1005,3.5,3.0,,,,,"In his novel ""Animal Farm"" George Orwell wrote ""All men are equal but some are more equal than others"". How true is this today?","
George Orwell published Animal Farm in 1945 and the book made him world-famous. It is a political fable in the form of an allegory: it describes the revolt of the animals on a farm who expel their cruel human master and resolve to run it themselves on socialist principles summed up in Seven Commandaments written on the lam. These commandaments are slowly modified and distorted from their original meanings and finally reduced to just one  because the pigs gradually win control and betray the revolution by restoring what is in fact a society based on exploitation.
The book is a general denunciation of any form of *totalitarism*, a word which Orwell began to use to define any sort of oppressive ideology be it Nazism or Stalinism. The ideas which Orwell explained in his book are true today: as in Animal Farm the pigs are able to gain the control, today some people are able to control a State, even a democratic State. Italy is for example a State based upon democratic principles, but these principles are not often respected.
I agree with George Orwell, because as far as I am concerned I think that in every country there are few people which are very rich and many people which are poor and what is most astonishing is that nobody tries to solve this problem. This inequality is more accentuated today because of unemployement: people do everything so as to earn money, they steal for example and this phenomenon has many consequences such as the diffusion of violence.
The difference are not only created by economic reasons but also by social reasons: in many countries there is still a great difference between white people and black people or between white people and people which come from Africa or Asia. They are considered inferior by many people so they are obliged to do jobs which other people don't want to do, for example in Italy they work in the fields or as housewives and they often treated badly. They have to earn money and it is for this reason that some of them work for criminals so as to earn money more easily.
I don't like this phenomenon and I think that the Italian Gouvernment should pay attention to this problem, they know that many people which come from other countries are exploited, but they don't do anything. I know that it is very difficult, but they should try to help them giving them the opportunity to work honestly.
Egoism is one of the reasons which create the difference between the rich and the poor because if the rich try to help the poor, some problems will be solved, for example I have read on the newspaper that a man of seventy years old has decided to create an association formed by aged people which live alone and has proposed to give a share of his pension to a poor family so as to help these people and so as not to live alone.
The conditions of the old are another kind of social injustice, because they are marginalized as they are considered useless. On the contrary they are very important for the society, they could be employed for some jobs so as to help young people. Orwell refers to *totalitarian* State in his sentence, but I think that these differences are very great in democratic State, too, which ought to safeguard all people's right.

ITRS1012,2.5,2.0,,,,,"Some people say that in our modern world, dominated by science and technology and industrialisation, there is no longer a place for dreaming and imagination. What is your opinion?","
It is true that nowadays people are more and more overwhelmed by the weight of science, technology and industralisation, but those who say that there is no longer a place for imagination are to blame.
The growing progress of the society cannot exclude the presence of imagination, since this is a subjective condition and does not depend on a general process such as that of industrialisation.
Moreover all men tend to dreaming in order to avoid an hideous reality, and our modern world leads us to seek shelter in imagination rather than deprive us of our fantasy.
Individual creativity should be the natural reaction to the mechanical life that society imposes on us everyday. Nobody can avoid dreaming, neither those who work in the name of science nor those who have bear the affects of technology.
But far from being a mere necessity due to a modern society which does not answer to man's necessities, imagination is also an innate condition of human beings.
Inventiveness is indeed the expression of our own personality, the way our individuality gains its dignity. Outside we are impersonal, we have to adapt ourselves to a reality which is common o that of millions of others and cannot be changed. But inside, through the eyes of our mind we can see a different world. Perhaps this world is just a lie, but it is our universe, the only place where we can be at case.
Since the visible aspect of life is no more acceptable, we have to find the beauty of existence inside ourselves. Imagination is thus essential for men, it creates hope and gives the boost to go on, to create something.
From this point of view we can say that science and technology themselves depend on dreaming. Someone dreams something and realizes his dream, this is the rhythm of life, its cyclical structure: what really matters is not to wear out hopes and dreams.
Nothing can be done without an impulse, without the pursuance of an aim, life itself would be impossible.
Imagination is inexaustible and even if reality disappoints us, we have another fantasy to grasp at. That is any it is impossible to believe that in someone's opinion our modern world does not give place to dreams and imagination. Dreams are our mind's bread, they keep us alive and a flourishing, industrious society should represent the realization of the dreams of a community.People dream of progress not of regression, and what are technology and imagination if not progress?
But suppose that somebody's dreams are other than keeping step with science, they could easily wait for their desires to come through since progress won't obstruct them 	There will be always room for dreaming because man is made up of dreams, and if science kills imagination it also kills man.

ITRS1013,3.0,3.5,,,,,"Some people say that in our modern world, dominated by science and technology and industrialisation, there is no longer a place for dreaming and imagination. What is your opinion?","
I don't completely agree with people saying that in our modern world, dominated by science technology and industralisation, there is no longer place for dreaming and imagination. I think it depends on each person's personality and way of being. As an example, I have a lot of imagination and I dream very much, so I don't believe any science technology or industralisation can ever destroy my modus vivendi.
At any rate, I realize that perhaps modern people have less imagination and dreams than people of past generations, but it is a matter of quantity, not of quality. It doubtless that there are some technological developments that lead spontaneously people to dream and image lesser than before. Television is, in my opinion, the best example of what just said. It doesn't allow people to have dreams because its fast images don't give you time to think about them. Television suggests you a world already created and watchers can only accept it. In this sense I say that there is no relationships between it and the people because TV gives something to people but they don't give anything back.
In spite of this fact, I believe that television leaves people time for dreaming, but not while watching at it, on the contrary later when one turns it off and can quietly recall the images and so create some new ones in his own mind.
All that means that television like other science technologies and industrial developments have to be considered only with regard to their usefulness by people. Technology is not bad if people menage to use it to their own advantage. It is my firm opinion that anything people do, they should always have time to rest and dream. I consider imagination as an outlet in a modern world that more and more needs people to be skilful, attentive and smart.
If really technology and industrialisation have moved dreams and imagination away from modern people, it is a matter of time. Indeed, we have no more time to rest and dream. Our life goes faster than life of some time ago; I realized it by speaking with my mother one evening that there was no light at home. We have been in the dark for two hours: my mother and I seated in the kitchen and began to speak. She told me that when she was a child, she used to spend evenings speaking with her parents and grandparents. These ones told the children tales of the past. She remembers that period as one of her best. She liked those tales because she imaginated to live those stories.
What my mother told me, led me think that I spend evenings in a different way: I am used to watching TV, or using computer or listening the radio. I usually don't spend my evenings speaking with my family. I am not upset considering these facts, because I realize that my times are so far from hers and that my imagination is excited by *inhuman* words, hers was suggested by human words. It s just a different way of considering this fact; to sum up, may be past generations had a genuine imagination and modern people has an artificial one, but it doesn't mean it is less good, it is only different.

At the end of the 20th century we can sincerely admit that our life is built in a world where science and technology hold sway. Economy, urbanization, the progress of science and industralisation, the improving medical techniques have already become part of our acquired knowledge, causing a change in our attitude towards life and towards our way of living.
The influence of this scientific and industrial development can be found in every aspect of human life: we act like robots while computer organize our time and our works at home, in the office and in the schools. We live according to our interest and following the best and simplest way of improving our social conditions, of achieving success and money.
Man regards himself as a *super man* endowed with supernatural and paranormal powers who can govern over every thing, who can subdue all the people he wants, who is free to destroy even the most elemental natural object.
Modern science has the power to control, to manipulate, ridicule and sometimes even destroy everything that refuses to enter into a scientific view of life.
In this context man is a pawn in its hands. Material interests and a great will to power characterize our existence on earth and unfortunately we are so occupied to live our technological life that we forget all the consequences it has: destruction of environment, destruction of peace, the rise of social differences. Chemical industries and the internal-combustion engine are fouling our water and our air, the demand for materials and for energy is depleting and destroying the earth's crust, our brains and our hearts are entirely polluted.
We are moving towards a future world where even our dreams will be regulated by any other scientific discovery.
I agree with all the people who believe that, very soon, in modern society, there will be no place for dreaming, fancy and imagination.
We are losing our capacity of loving, of dreaming; we are neglecting our emotions, our inner world. Today we do not understand the importance of dreaming in our life. A dream is not only the voyage we make in the subconscious mind or towards the unknown, but it shows us a particular way of looking at things. It opens our eyes to a vision of the world full of imagination and which lacks of any social and moral prejudice. A dream is something which is free, which escapes from any human control: it is the mirror of our fears and our hopes.
It is thanks to faculties like dreaming and imagination that we can preserve our future world from pollution and corruption.
It would be necessary to turn our interest even in poetry, as it is the best expression of our feelings and of our emotions. If science is a work for the head, poetry is for heart, it is an invitation to sweetness, reflection and silence. Poetry can help us to discover the real value, the real importance of spontaneity and creativity.
In this context we should avenge the power of innocence and the search for certain purity. This is not a way of closing our eyes towards the immensity of life, but it probably represents one way to live in peace and in the respect for the others.
Unfortunately the only dream which is admitted in modern society is the search for hedonism, consumerism and careerism.Nowadays there are few people who really believe in the power of dreaming, fancy and imagination while the whole society has already based its exsistence on science technology and industralisation.	We should understand that there is something else in our everyday life and not only power, money and success, that there is a possibility of salvation for this corrupted society and that the true happiness does not lie in wealth. But we should believe in new ideas, in the power of love and friendship, dreaming and imagination, peace and justice; we should rediscover our natural life and then, perhaps, we will be able to face a new day, to open our arms to the sky and to walk with our naked feet in the rain. We have to bring back to children their right to dream their future just as they want!
I know there is much to be done, society cannot change from one day to the next, and probably my ideas are utopian butif society prevents us from dreaming, what will become of us?

ITRS1041,2.5,3.0,,,,,Crime does not pay,"
This assertion could not be more appropriate to the last news items everybody has heard on television or read on the newspapers in these days.
Nowadays anyone who turns on television or opens his newspaper find a new crime committed everyday and with the passing of time, the crime is more amazing and horrifying.
Two of the crimes committed lately have particularly struck my attention.
The first one is the murder of Marta Russo, committed at Rome's university *La Sapienza* about three months ago, Marta, a university student of 22 years old, was walking down the path of the faculty when someone struck her dead. I did not know her, but the fact that I could have been these instead of her has made me think about her deeply. The life of a young girl broken I do not why, maybe just by chance or as a joke. What a cruel fate!
The second one is the murder of the famous designer Gianni Versace, committed only some weeks ago while he was coming back home. I did know him in person as well, but I liked him way much through his clothes and the fact that he is dead probably because of the madness of a deranged person has also upset me strongly.
These are only two examples, but I could mention many other crimes that make me be speechless every time. Crime is increasing every day and the most worrying fact is that more and more the reasons of these actions are absent. Every kind of crime is horrible and they should not ever happen, but when they happen with no real reasons it is even more dreadful.
People commit crimes nowadays as often as they eat or go to the cinema. Why do they act in this way? What is the reason for these bad actions? What does people gain by acting like that? What did Marta Russo and Gianni Versace's murders gain by their deaths? I cannot really understand that.
Crime is not the way to solve a problem, if there is one. Nevertheless, more and more people seem to choose it.
Another very worrying fact is that people who commit these crimes are more and more younger.
Government does not know how to stop crime and people often unpunished. In this way they do not understand that they are making a mistake and that they do not resolve or obtain anything by their actions and the problem increases instead of stopping.
Honestly, I do not know the solution to this problem myself. The only thing I know is that I am very worried because I know that my life is in constant peril because of some mad people who do not know what they are doing.
Crime is a great problem which concerns all Europe, not only our country, and I think that each nation should seriously undertake to do something if they do not want to lose control over humanity and make good people live in terror.
In a world which claims its superiority and its development, it is not possible to have such a kind of problems.

ITRS2002,3.5,3.0,,,,,Most university degrees are theoretical and do not prepare students for the real world. They are therefore of very little value,"
The great illogicalness of the most university degrees consists in the fact that students must have a too outdated school system compared to the modern necessities. As a student, I could see that programs often are based on theoretical knowledge as to compel students to learn by heart, without remembering anything after one week.
Students are not asked to know the practical aspect of their studies, so one day not only will they find that their knowledge is useful only for themselves, but also that the world they have in front of them is different from how they have imagined it. They should do practice and theory together, as to make them smarter and more complete before entering the real world. Sometimes beginning to work and seeing that all sacrifices you have done to study are of no value is baffling, especially because students can't choose the job they prefer, so most of the times they do something completely different from their studies.
I imagine it would be easier for them to do practice of what they have learned, but all this implies changes and reorganisation of the whole university system, as to meet students necessities.When you attend university you have an age in which you should know what to do in your life, but sometimes you are not taken seriously. In countries where the university system is well-organised and updated, such as Germany, teachers pay attention to the students needs, and they incite students to improve their natural talent if they have some. Students are guided and prepared to enter the real world through apprenticeships organized by the universities.The saying *practice is better than theory* should be taken into consideration, also because when students, after their degree, begin to look for a job, they don't have any kind of experience. The answer you receive in an interview is always the same: *I am sorry, but if you don't have any experience..*.
I am not saying that spending too much time among books, theories, ideas is not useful, but it should be important to make into practice all the notions learned. Not only are university degrees too theoretical, but there is also a great distance between universities and the world of work. The gap between these two different world is so wide that students can't become a part of the real world.
Being without any kind of experience makes students feel lost, and although some of them are lucky finding a job, they realize that their degree is of no help.
I believe that if a collaboration existed between universities and the world of work, firms could engage its employees directly from universities. With much practice of real situations and events that actually happen rather than just ideas and notions, students would be ready to enter the society, and they could also be much more efficient.
I can honestly say that, nowadays, universities degrees help people only to create their personal culture, and that they don't prepare students to face the real world.

Science, tecnology, industrialization in a word *progress*. This seems to be the key-word of our times. Progress is at the base of civilization, of our life. It would be quite difficult to do some of our daily and actions without the help of tecnology. And this is perhaps a way which causes our creativity to diminuish. But the range of science is a very big one. In fact, how would man have cured some of terrible diseases without the help of science?
And if we hope to overcome some others it is because we trust in science.
So, if on one hand science has improved a lot of our life, giving us also more security for our future, on the other hand it has led to the creation of new conceptions, for example subordinating the beauty of one thing to its usefulness and to the earning it can provide. Also our way of thinking or of living seems to be razionalized.
We often think in terms of calculations, we talk about causes, consequences. Everything seems to be organized in our life, and if something goes wrong we say: *I should have thought* in other words: I should have followed my rationality, not my feelings. But if rationality is an important aspect of our life, it is not the only one. Behind our appearences of perfect men there are our dreams. I don't agree with people who see man as an automaton who lives in a reality where everything has been invented. For being so much immersed in an industrialized and so well organized era, man needs his sensibility, his imagination, his dreams.
But if we give a look to history we always find man in this dialectic of opposites. We never find man totally abandoned to sensibility or to rationality. He always needs to create, through his imagination, a world different from the real one, perhaps to compensate it. Or something which would detache him from reality: man needs the confusion of civilisation but also his own solitude.
But I want to say more: perhaps these two poles, modern progress and imagination, are not separated but strictly correlated. If science goes on, it is because man invents, images, dreams, it is because he is not satisfied with what he has, it is because his fantasy gives him the possibility to create many hypothesis.
Perhaps this is a vicious circle: but this is not important. However it goes the result will be a positive one.

Two years ago a friend of mine published a collection of poetries.
Beside the fact that I know him very well, I was not surprised at all to know that ever twenty old people write poetry at the end of the twentieth century. I'm also used to writing poetries and I am sure a lot of people, both young or old, are.
I think poetry is one of the best ways to utter somebody's own imagination and dreams, so I think this is a proof that in our age, where science technology and industrialization are the rules, there is certainly a place left to these expressions of human soul; but the example about poetry is not the only one and maybe is not the most striking to the point I want to get.
Let's think about music. People really spend a lot of money to buy the new CD of their favourite singer or to listen to some new kind of sounds just to relax or have fun at a party, or just to escape for a bit from their reality.
Let's turn to the movies. How many people are just waiting for the week-end to come and to shut themselves up in a cinema?
There they can forget about the way their real life goes and sit down to watch the ideal one, which, even when sad and bitter, always seems to be better than their own.
Many of us are even television-depending: they could die if they happened to miss their soap opera or their favourite detective-serial!
Of course it's often said that television kills your imagination, but from the point of view I took as an example I just see it as another way to give place to it. To make it clear it's enough to think about grown people who watch cartoons.
And what about books? Some of them just make you fly to another world, and if somebody calls you when you're reading they really have to snap their fingers in front of your eyes, since you just look absorbed in a day dream.
I'm sure there are but very few among us who never felt like losing themselves in a poetry, a novel, a great classic.
Even if our tastes can be totally different and I might not find enticing at all for my imagination what may be is for is for someone else's, I'm quite sure that we all have our own way to dream, even today, and maybe just today more than ever, since nowadays everything and everybody seems meant to be a computerized reality.
Technologi is soffocating everybody, and nobody likes being soffocated, I think.	I think it inner in human nature that man can't help but satisfying his own need of dreams and imaginations, because these themselves are inner in us. Man is like that, and if he was not, even the cinematographic industry wouldn't produce what it does nowadays!
Imagination and dreams, in my opinion, stimulate man in every field, even in sciences. If man was devoid of these faculties he would be an irrational being or a machine.
Man, without imagination and dreams, is not man at all.

In the last italian referendum that has been made, the change in military service was one of the proposed theme; this time I have reflected upon the experience those young men live, and I can say that most of the time it is not simple and positive. I know it by experience, as I have many close friends who had troubles in accepting the military service, and I'm sure it was not for a sort of personal rebellion against the system, but mostly because of the hostile surroundings they have to face.
Military service assembles young people of different ages: from the 18 years old teenager to the 25 years old young man who has just taken his degree and is looking for a job to settle down.Most of them don't want to join the Army, and they do it only because they have to.In my opinion all armies should consist of professional soldiers: they choose this life as they believe in it, or because they feel ready to start the experience with all the obstinacy they possess.
Italian soldiers who go abroad for ufficial actions are voluntary troops; they are well drilled to deal with a war operation as it was in Bosnia or in the Gulf. But the remaining troops that spend one year in the barracks training all day long have no real function. At the end of their service most of them are not able to manage a rifle in the correct way, or to drop a hand grenade. They have only learned how to reply a general, and to receive orders.
Some may say that this experience can be formative for young people: they leave their homes, they have to arrange everything on their own, to obey their superiors, respect the orders, the cleanliness But everytime I think of the military discipline, I remember those guys who have to face with the vexations, of the fellow-soldiers and of the superiors as well.
There are some who fall victims to the *nonnismo* (a sort of hierarchic system among the soldiers that is used to punish the youngest and to favour those who join the Army for a longer time); sometimes they are so oppressed that they commit suicide.
By reflecting upon those tragic consequences, I ask myself whether our military service is really formative. It could be a forming experiences and at the same time an helpful service for the country, but I may say that now it is not like this.One of the problems connected with the actual system is also an economic question: every soldier gets a wages but the professional preparation he gets back is not so effective as it should be. In the meanwhile the Government pays a lot of money for a drilling that has no real value.
Consequences of a reduced military force must be met an highter number of Army pensioners who have to be paid; all the military buildings that will be closed will become useless immovablesThe question is not simple.
But why going on with a squandering investment when a smaller and better drilled army is sure more efficacious and professional?

Generally speaking, nowdays the number of students who attend University has increased. I don't exactly know the situation in foreign countries, but in Italy some Universities are crowed with students, who sometimes decide to attend it just because they can't find a job after High School.
Obviously University is seen as a sort of passport for the working world, but we know that most degrees do not prepare students for it. Let me give you some examples.
I'm taking a degree in foreign languages and literatures and I'm still really proud of my chooice.
I study English and Spanish, besides many other subjects, and one day I'd like to teach them. But when I think about this possibility I get very sceptical because I don't feel able to teach Spanish at all.
I don't think I can speak Spanish fluently even if I passed the three exams with high marks.
Actually the classes were too theoretical and students didn't have enough time for Spanish conversation, not to mention the fact that most of the classes were in Italian. In short, I believe I have a good knowledge of Spanish literature but a modest one in language. What I'm trying to say is that, too often, University is not qualifying and students need to specialize in the subject they are going to deal with in the working world.
I have just talked about my personal case, but I know that many scientific degrees are even worse. For instance, Italian engineers are said to be among the best in the world. But is this true?
How can this be possible if they start going to the laboratory for experiments only after the fourth year?
I have a lot of friends who are studying engineering and most of them have very good marks in computer subjects, while actually don't even know how to use a computer! Are their exams of any value?
Let's now talk about the most theoretical degree at all: law. In Rome this department is the most crowed. Students have to get to University two hours before classes start if they want to find a seat and to listen to the teacher. Everything is learned in theory without any contact with courts.
Naturally there aren't only disadvantages in a theoretical degree. Actually students have often excellent cultural bases and this proves advantages when they decide to take a M.A. in another country. In this case they will become very good workers because they will acquired theoretical system and practical knowledge. But what about people who can't afford it, or who don't want to start studying again?
The problem persists and I believe it can only be solved with a general reorganization of University system.
It should be given more emphasis at the practical part because in the real world a person who can use a computer is by far more useful than one who has studied how to use it!

ITRS2009,2.5,2.5,,,,,"Some people say that in our modern world, dominated by science and technology and industrialisation, there is no longer a place for dreaming and imagination. What is your opinion?","
This sentence is partially true and partially not. Why?
It is true because the rising generation is growing up with few stimuli to their imagination. For example the toys babies play with are all ready, children have just to decide if play use with them or not, so their creativity isn't stimulated.
All this to start with babies' toys, to reach adolescents' world, made of personal computer, television and all Hi-Tech products. Is it correct? More or less this is nowaday situation caused by technology and industrialization but it doesn't mean that people's dreams and imagination have been rubbed out.
Mankind is made of dreams, we could not live without the idea of a strictly personal world were we can refuge in our everyday life when social requests are too difficult to stand.
The psychological need and certainty of escaping helps us even to face our problems, because we can isolate ourselves for a few moments just to take decisions to reflect on what we are going to do or not.
This is my idea of imagination and it is also helpful when trough it we can show who we are or express our artistic vein.
But which is the role of dreams in contemporary life? Dreams can be dangerous or positive, it depends on the correct use we do of them. They can take the place to real life and that would be the worst fault of our existence. Dreams are important, we can fly away with fantasy but we must come back and make a distinction of what is real and what is not. Sometimes dreams and ambitions are at the same level and that is an important *step* but always trying to avoid the identification between possible things and unreliable dreams.
The live which divides concrete and fantasy world is very thick and the trap of being mad or lucid lies here. Thank to technology and industrialisation the *colour* of the world is becoming grey more and more as our lives are becoming more and more impersonal.
The reason is that we look for money and not for feelings, we want a big car and not a wide garden to look at when we open the window. Our lives can take the colour of pollution or be bright as sun is, we have the possibility to choose. The happy medium is to live following the *rhythm* of society but personalysing our work, our way of doing things, our state of mind. That's the important element we must preserve from the great mass and it is possible if we really believe in something to fight for.
What is at the origin of all this process? But our dreams and convinctions, nothing more.

ITRS2012,3.0,3.0,,,,,The prison system is outdated. No civilized society should punish its criminals: it should rehabilitate them,"
Criminals' rehabilitation is one of the main problems in modern society. Crime is on the increase, and unfortunately it involves children more and more often.
In my opinion rehabilitation can be useful in particular with the minor. Crimes committed by young people are generally connected with drugs or they are robbery, and I believe that they are the result of a bad or of a lack of education. The idea of a school to re-educate young criminals is good, but approved schools are only a legal form of repression and make a hardened criminal of a young one.
Approved school should rise an interest in its prisoners, it should be a kind of school in which young people can also learn a job. A lot of children break the law because they have never thought about the consequences of their actions, or simply because they are insecure and they think they can gain power by committing crimes. They must not be sent to prison, but made more self-confident: they must know that power can be reached in a legal way.
But also the other criminals can be rehabilitate: no one is completely hopeless, and a modern society should try to make good persons of their criminals.
The main point is that the prison system not only is outdated, but also wrong in its basic ideas, and this is true in most of the countries. Criminals must be made conscious of their actions, and the time of their imprisonment must be useful. They can work or learn a job, or even take a degree, follow a language or a picture course etc. When they will have again their freedom, they will have found their personal attitude and will not need to commit a crime to survive (provided the society is ready to give them another chance without prejudices). Luckily, people can change.
Surely there are some criminals who do not repent having done evil, and I do not know what to do with them (if I knew, I would probably be famous judge or something like); but I think it is worth trying to rehabilitate all the prisoners. Evil cannot be extinguished from society, but society can surely be better.
Anyway, society cannot leave criminals alone for economical reasons. A lot of countries have the death penalty, even a nation that we consider democratic, the USA. In my opinion life imprisonment is a punishment hard enough even for murders, and I consider death penalty only another murder. If we think that very often people are condemned to death because life imprisonment costs too much, it seems pointless to talk about rehabilitation.

In our society, where science and technology have come to pervade every aspect of our life, there seems to be a growing dislike for the original and creative man. At every level and in every field, the qualities requested are quantity, organization and quickness, and the ideal hero  as represented in movies, television, newspapers  is the cold and colourless man with no other passion than a craving for success. Success! The key-word of our time! To be successful means to be active and pragmatic even at the expense of every other human value. No, you cannot miss the train of progress! But this fierce law of competition necessarily makes a wretched outsider of the imaginative man.
Let's take movies as an example. Even in this field, which on my opinion should be a domain of the creative imagination, technology has become predominant. Nothing is spared to make all the surface details correct and wonderful, but if we look carefully we discover that this outer impressiveness is only masking the absurdities and incongruities of the plots, the total absence of characterization  in short, an inner emptiness.
As a result, the most popular movies are the ones which strike only our eyes, letting our mind sleep!
The inner emptiness-outer impressiveness formula is applicable even to man himself: a good social status, a perfect body, Appearance are the goals of the majority of people.
I wonder how the new millennium will be like if the world is inhabited by anonymous people, all numbered and registered, with no rich personality, no sensitive mind.
However, I am deeply convinced that sooner or later this situation will explode. Each civilization is born, it culminates, and it decays: our Western civilization seems to run mechanically to its end.
Although industry produces refined technologies and science is at the apex of material conquests, although men communicate almost instantaneously by telephone or computer and news can be broadcast everywhere, our civilization will lose its fertility forever unless it doesn't recognize the full importance of human values and the irrational side of men.
Is it so surprising that only in our society men pay to understand themselves and to accept their passions? Is it so amazing that there is a growing interest for Oriental cultures and philosophies, which are much more concerned with the inner side of man?
I don't think that science technology and industralization are bad in themselves (that would be foolish!). I only wish they could stand by side with other important and more specifically human entities. A good man should know both science and literature, both the matter-of-fact world and the imaginative one.
In short, I agree with the Ancients: the *happy mean* should be our real ideal, the path to be followed.

ITRS2016,3.0,,,,,,Most university degrees are theoretical and do not prepare students for the real world. They are therefore of very little value,"
The idea that most university degrees are of no value because they do not prepare for the real world is widespread today, in our country. It arise, above all, from the problem of unemployment: when a student comes out from university he generally does not know how to find a job and even if he has a lot of dreams or plans he cannot make them real. Why? Is it a University's fault?
First of all we should consider what theoretical means: abstract, for away from reality, that exists only in the mind. So, often we think that what is theoretical is also useless to people who live in a civilized and modern world; sometimes it is true, in fact, nowadays what a student lacks is experience.
Secondly it would be useful look at the expression *real world*. In this context, I think, it refers to unemployment, one of the problem of our *real world*, but it also refers to situation or conditions a student is not used to because at University he did not experience them. This is the most important fault of University degrees.
In spite of this, it should be considered that at University you have to study, and it is not studying that a young person can learn how to live in the real world. Even if you read of something or if someone tells you of it, it would not be the same as if you experience it. Perhaps university cannot do anything to help students in this field.
Then, no university degree is of little value. Everyone can choose what he likes most without being influenced from this kind of judgement. It is true that a degree helps to find a job better than another, but it is not true that theoretical faculties are of no or little value.
University gives you bases, a background, it learns you how to think and judge with your own mind.	
Concluding I think that all university degrees are useful to form oneself, everyone must choose what he wants, that would not be useless for him. It is right to think about the future, to a job, but it is not university that must give you it. University should learn you how to reason and how to give good judgement about things, then you have to go on alone, even if you'll have to face the problems of the *real world*.

The 20th century is also called *modern world*, because by now everything is dominated by science technology and industralisation. Computers, robots, internet and virtual reality have replaced man and his duties. Nowadays, communicate with someone who lives on the other side of the world is very easy, as well as, staying at home and ordering the computer to do the shopping..that is not surprising.
Travelling all over the world is a simple thing and quick as a flesh, one can end up catapulted from Cape town to VANCOUVER in less than eight hours and I would not be surprised if two people spent a honeymoon on the moon or on MARS.
Manual work and heavy jobs have been replaced by science technology or rather by sophisticated robots which carry out its duties better than men or woman. Today, working in a factory or in a mine, present minor risks compared to the past; moreover, in the days, the figure of man with his head bowed under a pit or a press, is disappearing. Even if, in some part of the world, these *offices* are assigned to the poor children who cannot refuse to accept them, since they need them, and so they are exploited. In short, I would not define it as an homogeneous industralisation, or rather, I would call it partial (industralisation).
New towns, built-up areas and skyscrapers that skim (over) the sky, multiply themselves daily, while our greenery is decreasing more and more. The countryside is not a peaceful place any more where one can relax, or place where a poet can find his inspiration for writing a poem.
Wordsworth drew his inspiration from the Lake District scenery, today, this is not possible any more. Why? Because our countryside has been industrialised and it has become a continual succession of factories, plants and motorways that have taken the place of small farms, brooks and panoramic viewpoints. Even our coasts with its beautiful beaches, that once gave us romantic sunset, are now full of innovating hotels and holiday villages.
Nowadays, every place has become terribly touristy, and on the other hand, it has lost its own romanticism. This marks the beginning of a new era, where there is no longer a place for dreaming, imagination and creativity, an era exactly defined as the mechanical age. So we are awake of the risk and the loss that this space age implies!! Because as we know, creativity and originality are more important than technical skill.
It is not surprising, if in the near future, our children will play with real spaceships or will operate by remote control real passenger trains or will pilot fighter planes. I do not know where are the frontiers between science and reality. Probably, our playgrounds will be replaced by real motor racing tracks or real runways, while the classic merry-go-rounds sink into oblivion.
In my opinion, all that cannot be defined as *modern world*: firstly, because the industralisation is partial, as we have already seen; secondly, it is no use having children able to pilot a plane, if then, they are not able to write a love letter or to use their own imagination. All that is very sad!

The world in which we live is dominated by science technology and industrialisation, things which have improved our life, in fact today we can count on more services than man did before. If on the one hand progress is positive because it has bettered the conditions of man's life, on the other hand it can cause some heavy consequences such as man's alienation and loss of identity.
Technology has given a great number of advantages to man's life and in this sense it is a positive thing, but there are people who are victims to technology because it has increased their mental laziness and contributed to reduce their imagination, their desire to dream and to cultivate dreams actively. In this sense progress becomes a negative thing.
I think those who run the greatest risk to become victims to progress are children who spend a great deal of their free time playing video games.
The fact that in our modern age children of eight or nine can use a computer is positive because it means that the world is making progress: today a child can do things that before could do only an adult.
Computer is important in the growth of a child only when it is used moderately. If computer is the only interest in a child's life it becomes negative because it may destroy other elements which must be present not only in children's life but also in man's life in general. I think there must be a place in our life for dream and imagination and children, above all, need them to stimulate their phantasy, something that seems to have been lost in our society.
In my opinion it is up to parents in the upbringing of their children to direct them towards activities which can enrich their inner world.
Reading represents one of the best ways to stimulate their phantasy. When we read a book the words used by the writer to describe a situation or a place make us create in our mind personal images, worlds opened exclusively to us. Reading may represent a way to escape from reality, a way to satisfy the reader's wish to start for places which exist only in our mind and which are created by our phantasy. Books make us recover our cleverness to create personal images against all those pre-established images which daily are imposed to us by television or video games.
Man must realize and adults have the duty to make children realize that progress has improved and simplified our life and we must appreciate it for this, we must take from it all the advantages he can gives us but we shouldn't let progress destroy or reduce a faculty which has always been tipical of man, the faculty for dream and imagination.

ITRS2020,3.0,3.5,,,,,Feminists have done more harm to the cause of women than good,"
This has become, at least in the last fifteen years, a kind of truism, a commonplace. I myself would not necessarily agree with such a statement, which sounds too absolute to me. I rather think that feminists have made many mistakes and that they often have chosen radical methods and ideologies to carry on their highly justified protests.
Much of the feminist ideology, at least in its most extreme aspects, is based on a wrong conception: woman is superior to man and there should be a separatist society, where women live and interact with other women and men with other men. In their opinion this would be the only way for women not to be oppressed or manipulated by men. Stating that one sex is superior to the other has been the perennial ideology and mentality of men, and I find it absurd to fight against it with the same kind of mentality.
Furthermore this kind of extremism does not emancipate society as a whole, it just creates interior conflicts.
Another aspect of feminist ideology (I'm still talking only about a certain kind of feminism) with which I totally disagree is their thinking on maternity. They have felt this to be a kind of slavery. I think women are freer and luckier than men because they have the possibility to live such an experience much more intimately and totally. Most important, of course, is that women must always have the freedom to live this experience or not.
But feminism has not been only this. Maybe those that think that feminists have done more harm to the cause of women than good are referring only to such negative aspects. Maybe they have forgotten or they never knew what women's life was before the feminist protest. We all owe much to them. In Italy they have done much for obtaining rights to divorce and abortion. Most of all they have started a change of mentality, they have moved the everyday woman to question, sometimes only unconsciously, the conception she has of herself.
Of course they have only started something, and there is still much to be done. We still live in a society ordered for men.
Now that some results have been achieved, women can carry on their fight more reasonably and concretely without violence or extremism.
But when I consider the condition of women thirty years ago, when everything was to be started, I cannot think of other methods but those the feminists used.

ITRS2021,2.5,2.5,,,,,Most university degrees are theoretical and do not prepare students for the real world. They are therefore of very little value,"
After having finished schools many students go up to the university with the hope of being better prepared for their job to come; they sometimes choose a degree because, according to the statistics, it is better valued when you are looking for a work.
This is the reason of the recent boom of some university degrees which offer a more practical preparation for real world of work: if studying data-processing gives you a job, you will study them; if becoming an expert in economy gives you a good chance, you can't help taking it.
Those degrees which are more theoretical than practical are in a period of crisis; they are considered of very little value. I do not agree with it.
It is important to be prepared for the world of work but you can't choose a degree only to have a work, putting by all your inclinations.
What is wrong is the structure of Italian universities; it can't stand comparison with the development of technology and industrialisation. Politicians do nothing or very little to change this situation with new laws and funds.
Including some new exams in the prospectus of those degrees which are too theoretical could be a solution; you could have exams in which applying your theoretical knowledge to practical matters; you could have a general idea about topics without which you don't fit in the world of work.
They could be maths, law and economy because when you look for a job you are requested to know them.
When you know these topics, then you are free to choose your degree without being afraid about future possibilities of work and without giving away your dreams.
Men do not have the same inclinations and the same desires; what university must cope is the homologation to a standard even if statistics say that it wins. It is better to have ingeneers or architects who love their job instead of having potential philosophers who are compelled to become architects only to receive a salary.
You can't forget that some disciplines are purely theoretical but they are not less important because of it; if society asks more and more for a skilled and practical preparation what about the human knowledge which is not important in the production process? What about an obscure line of poetry or the history of ancient civilization? They have value, a great value to mankind even if there is no place for them in the real world of work.

In his novel Animal Farm, George Orwell wrote *All men are equal: but some are more equal than others* How true is this today?
George Orwell wrote Animal Farm in 1943-44 during the Second World War.
Since then lots of things happened but I think that his idea and his message are still sadly true.
We live in a period of relative welfare and it is not always easy to stop and think about the different realities around us. In modern industialized societies all men are equal: that is what everyone usually says. Unfortunately what people says doesn't always reflect what they think.
The whole world is caught in the pangs of change: borders enlarge and barriers fall but ironically people try to lock themselves in. It looks like instead of opening our limited world to others we are trying to close ourselves to them.
This is a growing habit and I think that it doesn't depend only on our bad dispositions. We simply refuse to see other people, we act as if they were invisible. If we look through them: we refuse to recognize the differences and to accept them.
For this reason I don't believe that in nowadays societies all men are considered equal.
Africans, Albanians, Polishes etc. who come to Italy to look for better possibilities are not equal for us. We don't think they have the same rights we have, nor that they should have the same opportunities. We consider them ignorant and dangerous, less equal than ourselves in front of justice and society in general.
But this is not only a problem about immigration. It is deeper and older than this.
Our societies are constructed in such a manner that it is necessary for them to be parted between riches and poors, bad and good persons, more and less equal people.
As for the law, it is notorious that if you risk to go to prison you must have money to pay a good lawyer.
And what is the end of the people who cannot pay? They should have the same rights of person who can pay but it is difficult to have them respected without money.
It could seem the usual common sense speech about the rich and the poor, but it is sadly true.
We want equality between us but when equality has to be enlarged to someone who puts in discussion our way of being, someone who can't be a perfect mirror in which we can recognize ourselves, equality becomes a subversive concept and we begin to fear its real meaning.
We should learn to consider the others starting from knowledge of their *otherness* and not from the assumption of our *normality*.
It is really easy to say *you are equal to me*; it is more difficult to say *I am equal to you*.

In the last decades we have gone much further on the way of industrialization and mechanization, often at the expense of human values; actually we have gone so far that a revival of interest in spirituality is recently taking place all over the world. Many people are becoming aware of the fact that in our era of rationality and computers rule the *powers* of the mind have been neglected, and a new attention to them is now necessary lest we should all loose our mental balance.
One does not need to be a psychologist to understand that men are complex beings, made up of body, intellect and feeling, and that one cannot ignore one of these aspects without compromising the healthy functionality of the whole. Since this concept seems to me quite a self-evident kind of matter, I wonder what is on the mind of those who claim, on the contrary, that there is no longer place for the exercise of dreaming and imagination, that is the emotional portion of human mind.
These people are probably simply scared: they are so used to rely on the certainties and sameness of our modern system, that they consider the irrationality and individuality connected to the sphere of fancy as something threatening, disproving an order.
The might also be persuaded that only pragmatism matters, that the mind should avoid abstract, improductive activities and only concentrate on giving birth to economic laws, mathematical principles or chemical formulas.
Some others boast a bold attitude towards life and look at dreaming as a way of escaping the troubles of actual life.
I am a keen supporter of the importance of imagination, especially in our modern world, nevertheless I have never maintained that we could do without antibiotics or electric power: the reason is that I have personally experienced many times the usefulness of both, although they also include aspects which I dislike. I the same way, I believe that those who advocate the uselessness of imagination or dreaming have never tasted the joys and benefits which they can provide.
The man who can dream is able to form a different picture of himself in his mind; he can plan his future and build his own individuality in a way that no computer would afford him to do. In his imagination a man can picture to himself a better situation, even a better world, thus getting a kick to go along and trust the possibility of an improvement of society. Moreover, those who are attached to mater-of-fact things are limited by the laws and physicality of their environment: in one's mind, on the contrary, there are no boundaries and everybody can express his own potentialities, aspirations, feelings at their best.
Those who have persuaded themselves that they can do without imagination and dreaming have no doubt repressed a part of their soul and I can not help pitying them. Actually I believe that dreams and fancies are potentially closer to the sphere o human values; they are similarly disinterested, heart-based and they lead man to look into his own soul. In doing so he is more likely to realize that there are things like dignity, freedom, love which are worth while caring, as they can provide greater satisfaction than the values of profit or technological advances.
But all things considered, is not imagination the self-same source of all progress? When man for the first time dreamt of flying, his was nothing but a dream, if not a folly. Nowadays we fly.

Jean Jacques Rousseau was one of the first supporters of the theory that civilization represents evil. *Emile* is the symbol of ingenuity and simplicity. It was easier, at his time, to avoid every contact with industrialization. Nowadays is very different. We live in a society where technology is more and more important. Every action we do, even the simplest is bound to it: we turn on and off the light, we watch television, we use telephones, computers, wash machines, we drive and so on. These are ordinary things, but our forefathers would have never fancied them. Science is getting on day by day in every field, and it is remarkably improving human life. Progress is a part of every day life now, and we can not do without it, or come back to last centuries even if we want it.
Following Rousseau's ideology, some may say that industrialization has brought more disadvantages than advantages to humanity. Those people put forward as a proof pollution, new diseases and a constant reduction of free fantasy and imagination.
Television gives us ready-made dreams and shell us with false images showing a golden reality, giving us what we should imagine by ourselves. Children spend most of their free time playing with computers and videogames or watching TV, which leave little pace to dreams. Grown-up people are more and more absorbed in their business, works and social life, so that they are not able to find moment to dedicate to themselves. But dreams do not take so much time.
Imagination is an inner part of human beings, even though we do not use it. One could dream only gazing at nature's beauty. A starry sky, a sunset on the beach, a storm, a snow falling can suggest wonderful emotions, and we can smile only watching two puppies playing with a wollen ball, a dog wagging its tail or just a child. But not only nature can be beautiful; if we think about men's intelligence we can dream as well: Eiffel tower, Coliseum, the pyramids of Egypt, a man walking on the moon, vaccines are signs of man's greatness. Our world and society offer many opportunities to escape from reality. It does not depend on the object of our dreams, but it depends on our disposition of feelings.
Our fantasy is the product of our education. We can dream only if we are used to do it since we were children.
Parents and school, which are the most important institutions in the life of a child, should teach him or not only history and maths, but also how to use mind and imagination in everyday life. There are many things which can spurr children's fantasy. Reading is more important; a book or even a comic strip?conwc?> ?strup?> can be useful, not only for a coming learning. Painting and sketching are the best way to test imagination and to show our secret dreams and desires. I'm not a philosopher or a pedagogue, but I think that in every man and woman there is a Peter Pan; it needs only to let him come out and express. Industrialization is not to blame for this lack of imagination; one should use technology and should not be dominated by it.

When we talk about the modern age, we must remember that it cannot be considered separately from the rest of man's history, because we are the children of a historical and evolutionistic development lasted millions of years.
Primitives had no time to sit and contemplate the beauty of nature, which was their enemy, since they had to fight for their survival.
Shakespeare could have never written *Hard Times*, because in the seventeenth century there were no industries. A modern architect cannot be expected to plan a building similar to Pantheon, because our conception of beauty, our religions belief and our political system are completely different from those of the ancient Romans.
Science and technology have deeply changed man's vision of the world and have replaced nature in the role of inspiring muse of our thoughts, but I do not think that they have destroyed our dreams and our imagination.
It is true that comfort has made us lazier and lazier and that routine has wasted away our body, but nothing can suppress our mind _ Computers have taken man's place in offices and in industries, but they are not provided with a typically human feature: imagination.
Since imagination is what keeps us alive and what distinguishes us from machines, we cannot say that nowadays there is no longer a place for it; it would be as if we said that there is no longer a place for the human race!
The functions of our brain are manifold and allow us doing many things: we can, for example, apply ourselves to scientific subjects and discover something which will improve our life, or we can behold the world and connect what we see with our own feelings, in order to create poetry.
I do not agree with those who say that our age lacks of geniuses, I think that modern sources of inspiration are different from those of previous ages. When we look out of our windows, we can see only piles of cement and clouds of smog and this makes us long for unpolluted landscapes, where nature is still mistress of the land _ We need our dreams, because they lead us far from a reality which is not very pleasant.
Progress has improved our way of living only from a material point of view, but has often crushed our wealth of ideas.
We run the risk of becoming passive, if we do not try, at any rate, to assert our individuality and we can do that by living our imagination express itself. We should not look for external stimuli, because they no more exist; we'd rather look into ourselves and have more trust in our cleverness _ I am in favour of science, but I think that man is not a machine; we are made of body and mind and our mind needs to be nourished, as well as our body _ Many people affirm that they have not enough time to sit and think and they do not realize that their brain works independently from what their hands do.

The role of woman in Western society is profoundly changed; indeed they can choose what way of living is fittest for themselves and most people say that women have not more obstacles than men to fulfil their own life.	Nevertheless now women have to face other problems and some of them have been brought just by the Feminist movement itself. *Feminism* was aimed to give the same opportunities to men and women for their living but I think that now this definition has assumed a different eaning.
First of all when something is too much defined (Feminism) it loses his spontaneity and becomes something which is standardized, with no more room for free thinking. Indeed, I believe that today's Feminism has built up a new model of *emancipation* in modern woman's mind that is not at all to free oneself but just to overwhelm the other sex.
This *extremism* which has taken root in women's cause has turned into the very source of some shows of male's supremacy which are still surviving. If women go on fighting to be the *stronger* sex men will have his own justification for their abuses because they will always fight a fruitless war to get the power.
I think that this way of being an *emancipated* woman is entirely wrong and harmful for women who want to be free thinking persons.
At a certain time Feminists even started to speak about *separatism* and an exclusive female-world.
It is inconceivable to imagine a female apartheid world because it is simply unreal: in our world men and women live together.
I firmly believe in a different nature between women and men and each person should accept the difference in the other; each person has a single, separate being with its own way of thinking and feeling. After having admitted the difference in the other it will consequently come the respect. The respect is the indispensable value of a society which defined itself *civilized*.
Women's cause should underline this aspect of the relationship between sexes and women should act more upon the *culture*, through the education of children (which is mostly put under the care of a *mother*) and young people, than just upon the *form* of this relationship.
Surely the *Extremist Feminism* has been a *necessary evil* at a certain time, when women were entirely subordinated to men; but today this extremism makes woman behaves like an *outdate* man and as result she betrays the women's cause in itself: she has begun to re-act man's attitudes, mostly wrong men's attitudes, losing her femininity, her female consciousness and identity. This way of behaving cannot help other women who must still affirm their identity and indipendence as a person.
Then this extremism also makes *certain* man; for instance that there are standadized sexual roles to be followed and there it lies, the real harm to the cause of women.
If women keep on speaking of Feminism there will be always an opposition, a very strong aimless opposition between sexes and fixed roles to affirm.
I strongly believe that women should replace this concept of *role* with a more *open-minded* concept: for instance an equal collaboration between sexes aimed to a mutual growth.
Only in this way it may be possible to destroy the prejudices which are still poisoning *modern* women's living.

ITRS2033,2.0,,,,,,The prison system is outdated. No civilized society should punish its criminals: it should rehabilitate them,"
Prison should be tought of as the place where the human society is avenged on its criminals. But theory and practice do not always coincide. The number of criminals and most of all the types of crime punished had greatly increased since prison systems have been established, and so nowadays things are not as plain as they should be.
The Italian prison system is particularly defective. First of all, once a crime is committed, the culprit is not necessarily caught, or even worse, is set free because of ignominious reasons like money, power and so on. But that lies outside the point. Let's suppose that the culprit is hopefully caught and sticked in prison: at this point the prison system starts showing its deficiencies. Trials may take years to be carried out, and during this period of time the accused are detained in prison at public expense. Unless, of course, the above mentioned accused are on house arrest or out on bail or out for health reason, which seems to be the latest fashion for escaping jail. Now let's suppose that the accused is proved to be guilty, and sentenced to imprisonment for a period of some years. It might even happen that, because of suspended sentence or remission of the penalty, the period of detention turn out to be shorten than that of trial. Finally the criminal is in prison, which is the punishment for his crime. But it is questionable either this punishment is useful or not. Some prisons are known for being extremely tough, even inhuman, or for close watch. As a matter of fact the majority of them is a place of degradation, both moral and physical, instead of connection and salvation. Prisoners are often brutalized and kept in unhygienic condition. Though relations with the outside world are few and watched, unauthorized relations are common, and by means of them drugs, dirty money, in a word, vice and crime can still rule the prisoner's life.
It seems an irony of fate that a prison should not be the right place where criminals can amend and even, if it might sound somewhat dated or utopian, repent. Convicts serving a life sentence, either they repent or not, endure social death, and are totally useless to society, if not to suck up a good deal of the public expense. What happens to those who are set free after serving their sentence is not necessarily better. They find themselves at a new start with a bad record and marked for life by their unpleasant experiences. None of them will ever assert prison to be educative. The lucky ones have families to wait for them, keep their hopes alive, and support them when they are finally out: they can eventually resume their places, their jobs. But those who had few chances before, will find themselves with far less, and as a consequence again devoted to crime: Crime against that same society who condemned them to such a degradation.	Punishment should have benefic effects to be taken for substantial. It is of no use to purge society of its bad elements only to let there back in worsen.
Of course some crimes are too abnormous to be emended. It is fairly difficult, for example, to rehabilitate a serial killer.
But the majority of crimes, those because of which jails are stacked with small criminals, depend on lack of chances, low standard of life lack of education, and similar causes. These are the plagues of society against which rehabilitation is supposed to fight, and, when rightly applied, can again a considerable victory.
It is true, though, that is unjust leave crime unpunished. But its punishment could and hopefully should coincide with a period of detention in facilities predisposed to rehabilitation, where *prisoners* can be provided with education and taught a job instead of brutalized and dehumanized rehabilitation is surely an expensive project. But the actual situation is no cheaper. Moreover rehabilitation may provide a job for those who actually receive the unemployment benefit. It can even it self cheap when its aim is achieved: the usual suspect, the small criminal continually goes in and out the jail's gate. While a rehabilitated citizen is supposed to work for the common weal.	Strong hopes are there that the day the civilized societies will lay aside their prejudice against rehabilitation is not for ahead.

ITRS2034,3.5,2.5,,,,,Feminists have done more harm to the cause of women than good,"
There is not much knowledge about feminism among young women. It is considered a kind of *revolution* of women against men, but it is not simply so.
This social + political movement developed during the last years of the sixties and it believed + aimed that women should have the same rights, power and opportunities as men. However this movement cannot be understood without referring to the situation of society in those years. The late sixties and early seventies were characterized by a deep crisis, which involved, politic, education, social relationships and in this context feminism set up a protest against an old-structured society ruled by men.
Feminism has old and noble origins which trace back to the French revolution. Women at that time claimed the right of being considered an important part of society, asking for civil and political rights.
In Italy during the Risorgimento, the question of feminism was still of little value, but at the end of the 19th century, due to the great number of women working in factories, the *female problem* became very important. Nevertheless what women really claimed was not only the right of working in good conditions, but they aimed at the emancipation of women as a movement of renewal of the heart of society. However women had to wait until 1945 to obtain an important success, indeed in that year they gained the right to vote. From 1945 italian population, like many others in Europe, was *busy* in *starting again*, there was a lot to do in a country destroyed by the war. This period sees the rise of the middle-class, and witnessed the so called economic *boom*. This well established middle-class still didn't give women the same opportunities as men, so in the seventies due to the ferments developed feminism broke out.
In those years women expressed their anger showing a strong rebellious aspect. They stood up for their rights in a society which didn't give them the same chances as men. They fought against male power, thus trying to destroy his role in society. They were against the old structured society where women could be mainly housewife, whereas man could study, work and chose with freedom.Unfortunately their noble ideas degenerated into a sort of extremism which spoiled their ideals, thus reducing, in some situations, their insurrection in a sterile fight between man + women for who had the duty to do the washing up, or the houseworks in the family.
In my opinion feminism was an important movement that marked a necessary break in Italian society. Thanks to those fights, now there are women free to dedicate themselves to successful careers in management, politics, science, before denied.
However these glorious conquests are only one aspect of the results obtained. The new and imposing role of women created a lack of balance in our society. Families are more and more abandoned by women interested in working many hours a day. Children are no longer educated by their mothers, but by baby-sitter, grand-parents or nursery-schools. The family isn't a strong institution any longer, and the consequences are a lack of values. Many sociologists claim that the weakening of the family and the consequent weakening of familiar bounds, are the main sources of many problems that distress our society.
So as I have analyzed the subject is controversial, because to some important conquests correspond some failures. I don't consider myself a feminist because I don't agree with the extremism they reached; but I believe that it was necessary to reach a certain freedom of choice and also to develop a certain self-consciousness which are the most important elements to be aware of our limits and our potentialities as human being.

ITRS2035,3.0,2.5,,,,,"Some people say that in our modern world, dominated by science and technology and industrialisation, there is no longer a place for dreaming and imagination. What is your opinion?","
The end of the 20th century is a witness to a dynamic world ruled b the development of so many different kinds of sciences and technologies that man often runs the risk of losing his control over them, even though he himself has given birth to them.
The improvement of technology and industrialization seem to proceed at the same rate as civilization, both looking for efficient services in a short time. But the rythms of industrial production, which have become part of man's life, determine some heavy consequences, such as man's alienation and loss of identity. The danger carried on is that the comfortable means of modern age may increase our mental *laziness* and contribute to our neglection of deeper values, of those spiritual ideals which require some effort to be discovered and actively cultivated. It is often easier to accept ideas from outside rather than elaborate personal thoughts.
The burst and definite ascent of *easy* technological means have dinned a purer, more genuine world, the inner self, with an invasion of pre-established images and material resources. This kind of messages is more quickly conveyable than written information, for example books. In such a practical society, images tend to prevail over the taste for conversation and reading, talking and dreaming: a state of war is set between images and imagination. It immediacy and universality of images which explain the success of this ready-made world upon man: they necessarily dominate him (unless he chooses hermitage!). Images also have a great power for persuasion, being able to reach millions of people at the same time.
There is still a place and a time for dreaming and imagining but these two dimensions are strongly threatened by powerful systems, coming from the external world. Today man's inner world seems to be tiny, restrained with respect to the overflowing magna of materialistic issues.
Reading represents one of the best ways to stimulate man's phantasy. It helps create personal images, worlds open exclusively to the reader himself. It may lead to a flight from concrete reality, and may also satisfy the reader's wish to start on imaginary journeys and meet fictional worlds, lively and coloured. If books tend to be unread, it is because one often yields to the temptation of doing actions which require less effort, like watching TV.
Nevertheless, dreaming and imagination are so deeply enrooted in man's life that no other activity will replace or destroy them. Their power is to enrich the mind with no-barrier worlds: microcosms in which man can happily lose himself, forget actual problems for a while and take shelter whenever he needs to, either when he is physically alone or when he is in the middle of a crowd.

If Icarus had not imagined imitating the flight of birds and Leonardo da Vinci had not drawn his flying machines, maybe it would have taken a lot of time to go to Australia. If Cristoforo Colombo had not dreamt of reaching India sailing westbound and he had the means to organize his voyage, perhaps Neil Armstrong and Burt Aldrin would not have landed on the moon.
Science takes care of one's knowledge and health. Technology improves human living conditions, grows longer and makes shorter the distances between men. Industrialization measures the rapid and frenetic rhythm of life. They have recently reached such a level that she expects them to resolve every problem of humanity and to please each demanding request as soon as possible. They promise to fulfil every desire and assure whatever one asks for. One seems not to be able to do without  tablets, digital alarm clocks, imported coffee, everyday printed newspaper, up-to-date cloths, brand new cars, mobile telephones, computers. One can cook a delicious dish in few minutes in a microwave while is having a chat with Mark from New York, by internet of course. When a think of science, technology and industrialization I cannot help but associate them with the idea of improvement, development, evolution and progress. They have always characterized the history of mankind in different way and with unlike results. But human being not only aims to live in comfort, he has also emotions and feelings. He needs to think, to believe in something or someone. One hopes and dreams that his future will be better and attempts to realize it.
Dreaming stimulates one's ambition, spurs men to go beyond their limits. Imagination has led writers, artists and philosophers far away into unknown worlds, in the abyss of the dream, in the complexity of mind, in the depth of human soul. And it has led scientists, engineers in a cell, in the highness of the sky, in the solitude of the sea, in the immensity of space, in the darkness of a blackhole.
Science, technology, industrialization, dreaming and imagination have all place in my world. I have grown up not only feeding my body but also nourishing my mind and fantasy. They will always influence more or less my everyday life, the will precede my decisions and nourish my expectations.
They influence each other and make everyone's life go ahead. In the eventies I watched a television series *Space 1999*; it dealt with the hypothetical life in a base on the moon. Afterwards *Star Trek* has brought us into space. This year, 1998, within one hundred days a part of a space station will be orbit, without forgetting the Mir launched in 1986. Imagination has entered our life. A dream will come true thanks to science and technology.

I defenitely agree with this response reflecting, in my opinion, a true and worrying reality; it is the reality we are embedded in everyday life, a reality totally monopolized by a ceaseless technology and industrial progress which, on one side, leads modern societies to a continuous improvement of life standards but, on the other, menaces the imminent loss of human values as imagination.	It cannot be denied that a spread difficulty in our creative imagination affects the world we live in and especially those modern societies where, about one century ago, industrialisation definitely gained ground.
Since then the internal structure of these societies has been subjected changes the new logic of production imposed which determined the rise of that *capitalistic system* most of modern countries are based on: distinctive features of industrialised societies were an extraordinary, although not equally distributed, richness and remarkable technological and scientifical progress.
Nevertheless, it is worth considering that industrialisation has deeply altered traditional values of life and influenced human and intellectual faculties: as a matter of fact, nowadays, the only dreams which still seem to fascinate most of the people are illusory dreams of richness and self-success expression of a general individualism; furthermore, faster and faster rhythms of life, dictated by the logic of roduction, have remarkably reduced that precious portion of time ewe all need to keep our creative imagination alive.
This uncomforting loss of our dreaming and imaginative faculty (attitude) is now a serious reality we experience: what, in fact, impresses me most is the lack of interest many people show for what is around them: in the continuous rushing of everyday life, most of the people hardly notices the sight of a natural detail or an outward outside view.
But, the analysis of this problem would not be complete if we did not take into account the primary role played by television and computers in our world: everybody is, in my opinion, aware of the extraordinary achievement computer represent in the field of communication: of course, they have significantly reduced geographical distances opening new frontiers and accelerating the circulation of knowledge; but, I'm seriously concerned with those extreme aspects connected with the use of computers which tend to destroy our creative imagination replacing it with a fictious and artificial one: virtual reality, providing people with artificial images and provoking false emotions is an upsetting example of this worrying reality.
Obviously I do not share the atmosphere of general enthusiasm and optimism about computers potentialities; however, I am not totally pessimist about the future of our creativity and imagination and I hope every body would be able to preserve this precious value which a great poet, about two centuries ago, defined as that extraordinary ability at:  .

ITTO5002,3.5,2.5,,,,,Most university degrees are theoretical and do not prepare students for the real world. They are therefore of very little value,"
Universities degrees are generally considered to be too theoretical and to do not prepare students for real world. At least this is what happens here in Italy.
In my opinion, the abstract is the most serious problem for the Italian Education System. Being graduated does not mean being able to find a job, actually. My English friend wrote me that Englis hstudents apply for a job during their final year at university, and that many companies offer special training schemes for them. Well, I do not know if their degrees are more practical than Italian ones, but it is a good thing the cooperation between universities and world of job. It allows you to enter the real world, and, in add, it does not make you think that all you have learned is waffle.
I am in my 4th year at university. I study foreign languages, but it would be better to say that I study foreign literatures. Someone may object that literature is important in order to fully understand the culture of a country, because its language alone is not enough. I agree with the fact that these kinds of subjects are important, but it is absurd that I will get my degree in English and that I study it at school only two hours per week. Perhaps pupils at primary school study it more than I do.
Is this an example of concrete schools? A chief firm would probably ask his or her employees to speak French, or Russian, or English fluently. He or she will not ask for their knowledge about one specific author; maybe the employees will be asked for practical skills.
Moreover, it is quite useless to attend courses about the English spoken lots of years ago. Noone in Great Britain will understand you, if you tell him : *I went to the LUH yesterday*, where LUH means lake.
Although certain subjects can be interesting for one's culture, the school system missed its target. Universities should better prepare their students, in order to give them more chances of being *absorbed* by the real world.
One possible solution could be a larger cooperation between universities and firms, or publishers, or everything else. In this way subjects could be closer to what the future employers will ask their employees. Obviously, the cultural aspect should not be totally given up, because I realize that culture is essential in one's education. In this way we could have both culture and practice, and graduated might be more satisfied with their studies than they are now.
There will be many problems in realizing this project; money for example. Perhaps it will require a lot of funds to reach the goal, but companies could offer jobs to students neither being paid nor paying them for the work done. In this way students could firstly have experience, and secondly become part of the staff of a firm.
The real problem is experience. I do not know how it works in the world, but in Italy before getting a job you must have already worked. How could it is possible, if a person is at his or her first job? This is a reason why practical courses will be useful.
To sum up, I agree with the critics made on universities degrees. And we should remember the saying *Practice is better than theory*.

ITTO5003,3.0,3.0,,,,,Most university degrees are theoretical and do not prepare students for the real world. They are therefore of very little value,"
Nowadays many students choose to continue studying after their *esame di maturit*. In fact university seems to be the best solution for young people who do not find a job or those who want to improve their education and have a better job. The opportunities a student has when he or she has to choose which faculty to attend, are many and very different. In order to simplify the situation we can divide the faculties into two groups: on one hand there are the scientific and technical ones, like Polytechnic, Physics, Mathematics, Biology, Medicine and so on; and on the other the humanistic ones like History, Literature, Philosophy, Arts and Law. In our technical and technological society scientific faculties have become fundamental and highly required (above all Polytechnic and Physics) in most areas of industry, therefore these degrees have aquired great value.
At the same time our *old* humanistic faculties are *living* in a critical period because of their possible uselessness as long as job-finding is concerned.
The most important obstacle of humanistic faculties is that their subjects are too theoretical, as they are thought for a job like teaching. Nowadays it does not seem very wise to choose a faculty which offers only this way out as, unfortunately, pupils are less numerous than ten or twenty years ago and there are already too many unemployed teachers.
The situation does not improve if we consider other jobs: in fact these subject are not fundamental in the practical working world. Can courses like History of the English Language or German Philology, for instance, be useful in an office work? Do they change one's opportunity for the future? A friend of mine, who last year got a degree with very high marks in *lettere classiche* is now unemployed. She asks herself if her choice to continue her studies was so good.
In this way we discover that not only some faculties but also some types of high school do not prepare for a job. In fact this friend studied at a *Liceo Classico*, which does not give opportunities to find a job after the *esame di maturit*. However also a *Liceo Linguistico* like the one I attended does not prepare for the working world, as the example of one of my ex school-mates, who is now working in an assembly line in a factory, should demonstrate. This girl is very angry and disappointed: she had studied for six years at that difficult school only to discover that knowing two or three foreign languages and their literatures is completely useless to get an office job. Probably it would have been more useful to attend an *Istituto Tecnico*, which aims to practical subjects, like computering, law and the commercial use of foreign languages.
The solution for our too theoretical humanistic faculties seems to be the new-born *lauree brevi*. A good example is the one for interpreters and translators, which sums up the knowledge of foreign languages and the preparation for a specific job which is and will be even more essential in a United Europe and in a world wide economical market.

ITTO5004,3.0,3.0,,,,,"In the words of the old song: ""Money is the root of all evil""","
Since money has been introduced our life has become more practical, that it to say we do not need to have something to exchange anymore but we just need to have enough money in our wallet when we want to buy something.
In the beginning money was made up of gold, silver and precious stones and many people began to accumulate it in order to have a financila richness other than that they already have (land, house, etc.).
Notwithstanding money has brought a lot of trouble in the history of human kind. If gold had not had its value, one could assume that now the American Natives could still live in peace.
They were instead exterminated because more *civilized* people were looking for a new place to live on and were then trying to become richer with the gold that the West of America hid.
With the invention of money the differences between the rich and the poor became more and more visible. In effect if one had a possession, he/she had to have also the right amount of money to maintain it and to pay taxes. But generally the little owners could not afford all the expenses and were obliged to sell their land to people who already had great properties. So, all around the world, there were a little number of rich and a huge number of poor and destitutes. In order to try to change their awful reality big rebellions against the States and their representants were made but things did not changed too much. People gained more freedom and rights and more economic help from the State but they remained what they were before.
Because of money men made also many wars. In the past already, people fought in order to gain a plunder for themselves and, at present, things have not changed much because if there is a war it means that great economic interests lie under it. For example why did USA decide to attack Iraq so quickly and let the ex-Jugoslavian people fight for four years? One could answer: because Iraq has a thing which ex-Jugoslavia does not have, i.e. petrol.
In our modern times everything is measured with money. Time is money, people say.
Besides if you have money you have a better social status. People inconsciously think that you are a better person even if you are not. For example if you go shopping well-dressed the shop-assistents will treat you with respect but if you go badly-dressed, it does not matter if your bag is full with money, they will think you are poor, you want to buy nothing and they will consequently treat you as a second-class person.
Notwithstanding its importance there are many things that money cannot buy. Health, Love, Happyness are what every human being actually looks for in his life. To reach these goals there is no material price which can be paid. That is why in the end we are all the same. The difference is only that if one is rich, he/she can have more opportunities to achieve what he/she wants than one who has not money at all. For example Giovanni Agnelli has died because of a cancer but he had tried to be healed in America. Probably if he had being a common person, he would have suffered more and died earlier. Yet he has died. What is important to notice anyway is that he could not save himself. His money was useless in order to stop his illness.
Besides also happyness and love are well-known unacquirable *goods*. There are many rich people who have everything they want but who cannot assume they are happy and loved.
For example Kurt Cobain, the singer and leader of the group Nirvana, committed suicide in 1994 in spite of being very rich, being famous and having a wife and a daughter.
It seems, in conclusion, that what really count is the meaning we give to money. If one let money become the goal of his/her life this attitude will bring nothing but evil. Yet if one manage to consider money just as a means, he/she will be able to hold a certain distance from it and will try to achieve other aims.
Finally, if the English song says, *Money is the root of all evil*, an Italian one says, *I know money does not give happiness. But fancy how can feel one who has none at all!*

ITTO5005,3.0,2.5,,,,,Most university degrees are theoretical and do not prepare students for the real world. They are therefore of very little value,"
During the last two decades, we have been witnesses of a rapid development in any field of knowledge which grow more refined day after day consequently, the labour market requires skilled people more and more. It is for this reason that almost two young people in three decide to continue their studies going to the university so to improve their work opportunities. However, the value of the university degree is nowadays put in question because of several reasons.
When young people enter a university, they are aware that they are going to spend many years studing a particular area of knowledge but once in possession of the so aspired university degree they have to face many difficulties in making the transition from education to work: they find themselves not so skilled as they thought and often have to deal with demoralization and allienation.
One of the main causes derives from the fact that even though university experience open people's mind creating the cultural basis to build up a career, it focuses only on theoretical and traditional teaching and lacks of practical one. For it is true that here in Italy there exist not training programs where students may learn what are effectively the real needs of the labour market. On the contrary in Germany students are required to do them in order to acquire different strategies to turn theory into practice which will be included in their curriculum.
In a situation like the Italian one, the consequences in the labour market are essentially two. On the one hand most firms of little and medium size do not engage graduated people without some kind of practical experience because from a legal point of view they should be paid as a complete skilled workers while they have not the working knowledge required resulting in this way too much expensive and unfruitful for years. As a consequence, firms prefer non graduated people who can be paid as apprentices. On the other hand big companies which can afford higher costs induce the young to attend training courses whose aim is to introduce them into the practical work. However, being engaged by this companies is not so easy: competition is very strong and only few people have access to these employments.
Being in the van is then another actual problem which involves both Universities and students who are placed in this sense in a position of disadvantage with respect to their peers of foreign countries. This is due basically to a lack of strong connections between universities and the employment world and to a general cultural closure towards experiments and new ideas. It is well known that researchers in italian universities are too limited and traditional and that the most intelligent brains here encounter serious obstacles in developing their new theories or techniques.
Therefore, they are forced to migrate abroad where universities, supported by industry, give men means and instruments to develop their creativity in order to make new discoveries and to apply them in practical working. It is no without reason that U.S. universities as well as their students are considered the most advanced in keeping up to date with developments in any field of study.
Consequently, italian graduated are handicapped from this point of view: they receive only a traditional teaching which, alhtough of great importance, is not sufficient in assuring a competitive knowledge in the labour market. Thus, graduated are often obliged to attend refreshing programs abroad spending further time and money.
In conclusion, universities should make efforts to establish strong cooperative relationships with the labour market introducing innovative new approaches to teaching such as trainings and experimental programs which can build more valuable and competitive skills.

During the Roman Empire who used to own a great deal of *pecus*, that is to say who breeded cattle, was considered rich compared to the slaves who had nothing. Consequently the word *pecus* developed into the one of *pecunia* with the meaning of richness, as we are used to consider it today. As a result, owning money man had the possibility to lighten his way to build up a decent life going for instance to a good school in order then to get a good job. Despite this, man has also seen how, throughout history, his possessions and his never-ending will of having always more have also become the root of all his evil. Therefore, why do not we finally consider the case of finding a happy balance between the two choices?
There is no doubt that man has an inner will which pushes him to obtain always something more from his capability, and money does not certainly stop this push. As a matter of fact, our modern and superficial society leads us towards buying, obtaining and possessing always more in order to be always happier. But doing so man has been reduced to a colourful, beautiful, brightly, but empty box whose appearance attracts whoever walks on the side-walk. Apropos of this, already in the 17th century Shakespeare asked himself if being or having was a solvable problem or not. The reflections of his far thoughts should be read in today's newspapers concerning the use one makes of money. How much money was spent for instance to build up soccer stadiums before the latest world championship? How about the money spent by the MAFIA to enrich its powerful and unmoral pockets? And the money spent in the illegal children trade from coast to coast of our different countries? Without continuing the list, there is no doubt that only considering the material and reluctant aspect of having money one tends to forget that before having one needs of being.
Nevertheless there is always the other part of the coin, which in this case shows how money can most of the time make people happy. And going back to the previous meaning of the word *pecunia*, it is easy to think that without something to possess and to trade, as it was for cattle, men could not eat and live. One needs to work in order to earn a certain amount of money and then live in a good way. This does not necessairly mean that one must be eager for gain, as a matter of fact there are lots of rich people that help and have helped the needed. It is shown, for instance, from various international pop singers who give part of their earnings to the third world populations. In addition, who does not remember the charitable and good works done by Lady Diana while living? And she was the future England's King wife!
Furthermore, one should step lower from the rich and famous people and see how much one can do from our less rich positions. If we had not had the right amount of money we could not face the university studies. We could not have gone to foreign countries and see the beautiful cities spread over the world. Not only can we better ourselves with money, but can we also help other people. Do we forget how many families adopting orphan children have helped them build up a new life? This has been possible not only because the future parents had a good heart, but also because money helped them to do it.
Therefore it may be concluded that doubless for many years in the past and for many years to come money could be considered the root of man's evil, but as it has been seen it is not always so. As a matter of fact is not completely true. Money and good will can cooperate to build up a good life and finding the right balance between the two one could also modify the famous book title: *To have or to be?* by the psychoanalyst Erich Fromm, into *to have AND to be*.

ITTO5007,3.5,3.0,,,,,"In the words of the old song: ""Money is the root of all evil""","
The word *money* is one of the most common ones in songs, books, newspapers and every day conversations. Everything that sorrounds us can be *translated* into money, everything has its own price.
A well-known motto says that money does not make happiness, but as we know, it can be useful! Moreover, another statement has to be kept in mind: it is better being in good health than having a lot of money. It is not always true that if you can pay for your treatments you will surely be better, as the touching case of Giovanni Alberto Agnelli has recently shown. Money is undoubtedly the means by which people can grant their own desires. But what are they? A new powerful car, a big house, beautiful clothes, but also other people freedom or institutions. When someone gets used to buy everything this becomes a sort of *illness*. If there is a problem money is the only solution, money becomes the key which opens every door. People pay for being privilegiate, for cancelling accuses, for a better appearance and so on, as famous political men and actors always show.
Money should be used for noble purposes, but, in many cases, this is not true. Everyone thinks at its own pleasures forgetting the rest of the world. So there are case of rich people who pay judges not to be condemned for their crimes and often innocent men or women pay the consequences. Not to speak about moral corruption money can bring. People who can afford every kind of pleasures are never satisfied and want always more; so it is common the use of alcohol and drugs to reach the highest level of emotions. It is a never ending circle which brings to unbelievable facts, like selling everything one person owns or having a great deal of debts.
Another aspect linked to money is the behaviour of people who do not own much money or, worse, who have nothing and live in indigence. Someone tries to improve its state with its own strenghts, other get worst and making money becomes the only reason of their life. So these people start ?bedding? and even stealing. They can eve kill in order to make money. To this trend many offences are connected and it is difficult to say whether illegal acts are due to the need of money or money is so powerful to corrupt human souls.
It is too easy saying that money is the root of evil, it is not always true. Men are often the major causes for evil actions, their aspirations and desires drive them to commit crimes. Money must be taken apart, it is our fault not its. Our nature is too feable to resist to temptations, that is why we hide ourselves behind abstract concepts. Money can be the root either for evil and for good: it is up to us making a choice.

ITTO5008,3.0,3.5,,,,,Most university degrees are theoretical and do not prepare students for the real world. They are therefore of very little value,"
In all probability university students wonder whether or not they spend their time uselessly in studying through four or five years in order to take their degree. it is necessary to underline that there are some university degrees which are more theoretical than practical and which aim more at enriching culturally student' minds than preparing them to enter the real world. The university degrees which are more theoretical than practical are the Art Faculties degrees such as degree in History, Philosophy, Modern and Classical Languages; on the contrary university degrees which are more practical than Art Faculties are Medical Faculty, Engeneering Faculty and Business Administration Faculty.
The degrees in Medicine and Business Administration give the possibility to students to do training courses in hospitals and in enterprises in order to help them to become more familiar with the world of business. Take the instance of Arianna Cataldo, a friend of mine who last year took her degree in Business Administration and now works as secretary in an enterprise in Turin. During her four years university course, she had to do training courses in different enterprises where she learnt to use computers and to keep enterprises accountings. Consequently, last year when she obtained her degree, she quickly found a job as secretary in one of the four enterprises where she worked during training courses.
In the medicine Faculty, students are obliged to do practical courses in hospitals, in fact it is not sufficient to pass all theoretical exams to get a degree in Medicine. Take the instance of Marcella Vittorini, a friend of mine who would obtain a degree in Medicine. Every day she does practical hours at the C.T.O Hospital of Turin. She tells me that practical hours are very usefull in order to understand better medical theories and to understand in what consist the doctor's work. She find practical courses very important in order to become more familiar with her future work.
In general, Arts Faculties initiate students into the teaching career. People are persuaded that being a teacher is easier than being a secretary and consequently they are convinced that practical courses are unnecessary. Take the instance of Jane Morris: ten years ago Jane got a first-class honours degree in history at Cambridge University and two years ago she found a job as history teacher in a Secondary School in London. Last year she was dismissed because the students complained to the headmaster about the fact that she was not able to explain the historical events.
She never explained History but obliged her students to study it on books by themselves.
Consequently, the dismissal of Jane gave rise to controversies about the fact that the Humanities degrees are more theoretical than practical . Final year students should have the possibility to do temporary teaching jobs or should work as teachers' assistants in order to become more friendly with students but above all with the subject which they are going to teach in future.
As far as modern languages degree is concerned, it lacks in specialized courses which may be useful to students who are going to find a job as interpreter in enterprises. the languages courses focus their attention more on literature than on language. In fact there are more literature exams than language ones. Moreover there are not courses about Business English, Business French, Business German or Business Spanish which I consider essential in order to find a job as interpreter.
furthermore, there are no computer courses or courses specialized in translations. When you have an interview the employer does not ask you to talk about Shakespeare or Oscar Wilde, but he usually asks you whether or not you know how to use a computer and whether or not you are familiar with business English, for instance. Take the instance of my aunt Emilia. She took her degree in English language ten years ago. When she went for an interview, she was not recruited because she was unfamiliar with Business English and computers. The employer preferred to recruit a girl who only held a school-learning certificate but who was excellent in using computers and in writing Business English.
Art Faculties ought to open students' minds not only theoretically but also practically by introducing into the degree programme specialised exams more linked to the practical world of business than to the theoretical world of culture.

ITTO6002,3.0,3.0,,,,,Feminists have done more harm to the cause of women than good,"
In the last few years many intellectuals have begun questioning whether the feminist *revolution* has improved women's conditions or not. It is undeniable that many feminists have exaggerated: for example, in the sixties thousands of women burnt their brasses as a sign of protest.
Nowadays this would seem ridicolous, since femininity is now considered a value and not something to be ashamed of. However they have had the merit of pointing out the many discriminations suffered by women at the time and of fighting for being considered equal to men in their rights and opportunities. Therefore, the feminist movement should be seen as a good attempt, partially successful, toward a more equalitarian society; and every woman today should be grateful to those women who have fighted for their rights.
Until the end of the sixties, women in the western world lived in a difficult and unfair situation. Their role was that of mothers and wives and their attempts to improve their social status through a job and a career were deliberately stopped by men. Women were told since their childhood that their fulfilment as a human being could come only from being good mothers and marrying a rich man. They were also told that going to the university and reaching a good level of instruction was unnecessary, since jobs such as doctors or lawyers were not appropriate for them. But this sad state of affairs was about to change; students and intellectuals started to fight for their rights and amidst them many women found the strength of raising the question of their status. It suddenly became a movement on its own, involving thousands of women and lasting several years.
Nowadays, the situation has changed under several aspects. Women have more or less the same opportunities of men. A woman lawyer or surgeon is no longer something unusual. Women may decide to devote their lives to a career, rather than their family. In many countries, governments have introduced laws in defence of women's rights. In Italy, for instance, the Parliament in the early seventies legalised the abortion, prompted by the feminists' fights. This has been considered one of the main victories of the feminist movement in our country.
In conclusion, it seems clear that the new opportunities which women have nowadays are the result of the feminist movement. Without their fights and perhaps without the excesses, too, women today would find themselves more or less in the same situation of thirty years ago.
",0.6666666666666667
ITTO6005,3.5,3.5,,,,,Feminists have done more harm to the cause of women than good,"
Since modern times women have had to strive to prove their worth in front of the society, indeed the social importance, merit and role of men was taken for granted, while women were considered as *alleged culprits* and therefore supposed to show up their value. Did they not have the right to fight to prove the world they were equal to men? Some might say that feminists have taken this struggle to the extreme, and so now they have to face even too many responsibilities. But it's undoubtedly true that without their committment women's emancipation would not have gone so far.
The first complains about women's situation within the society can be found in the work of Mary Wollestonecraft *Vindications of women's rights* (that would have later become the Feminists' Manifesto): at this stage the dispute was meant to establish an equality between the two sexes only in terns of moral and intellectual values. But she was already considered as an extremist by the men of her time, so deeply attached to their *angels of the fireplace*. Was it not better for them to have as their only preoccupation their little world inside their house and no larger than that?
Evidently the principles spread by the French Revolution were gradually affecting women's mind, because they were starting feeling the need of being considered as integrant and autonomous parts of the society in which they lived. This meant the vindication of civil, legal and political rights. The right to vote became in fact the first goal to reach for the movement of the so-called *suffragettes* (obtained in 1918 in Great Britain and in 1920 in the United States).
In wartime then being a woman meant a double role: adoring her man and taking his place at work. On the other hand the philosophies of the totalitarian regimes fostered the ideal of manliness, the role of *pater familias* and the physical strenght as far as men were concerned, while women were relegated to the role of mothers of little armies of children (possibly male) who would have served their motherland. On the other hand, they could not only accomplish this subordinated role, because they even had to take their husbands' places at work to earn their living (and obviously to help their motherland economy). This meant to be unofficially active in society (unofficially because not recognized as such). This led to big struggles during the years around 1968, when the Feminist Movement took on his hardest form: women started even thinking that they could bring up their children without the figure of a father present to them, that abortion was only a woman's choice, that omosexuality was the only possible answer to men's degeneration, so on and so forth.	Naturally these are extremes positions, the right measure should lie in between. The problem that, thanks to the feminists of all times, women have now achieved several rights, but they have even taken on several (if not too many) responsibilities: they keep on having the roles of angel of the house and of mother, but moreover they have a job now, and possibly some spare time to dedicate to themselves and to their interests. So what could be called the *women's burden* is the fact to be not AS men, but even MORE. And this is due to the fact that while a woman's roles have been increasing, often a man's ones have not followed this path, and certainly not at this pace. What feminists maybe did not do is convincing men they should change and mature alongside with women.
In conclusion, if nowadays a woman in a civilized society can choose her way into the world and have the possibility of self-fulfilment, this is undeniably owed mostly to feminists of all times.

Our modern world is dominated by science technology and industrialisation. Progress and everything linked to it are becoming more and more important, to the point of having prevalence over nature and even life. We can just think of the numerous forests or old buildings that have been pulled down in order to build new industries or science laboratories. But is there still a place for dreaming and imagination in this technological society? Even if many people could argue that *Imagine* and *Dreams are desires* are words that can be used in songs, but not in real life, I strongly believe that there is still a place for dreaming and imagination in our modern society.
Firstly, where there is a child, there are always dreams and imagination. Everybody knows that children like inventing funny stories and amusing plays by using their wide fantasy. This is one reason why children always bring happiness and awake the adults` childish part. On the other hand, fantasy is a useful mean used by teachers in primary schools to teach school subjects to their little students. So, it is children who keep dreams and imagination alive! Therefore, as soon as there is a child in the world, dreaming and imagination will be possible too.
Secondly, the *Fantasy World* is not a place only for children, as there are many adults who are surrounded by it. In fact, many adults create fantasy by producing advertising, comics, cartoons, toys and other things like that. If they did not have fantasy and imagination, they would not be able to realize their projects in their jobs. On the other hand, technology is very important for these fields, as, thanks to it, these people can realize what their fantasy and imagination has created. However, technology would be unuseful without imagination and fantasy.
Finally, dreaming and imagination are foundamental for our lives. In fact, our life`s goal is to realize our dreams. If we did not have dreams, our life would be aimless. We can just think of the fact that common people have a lot of dreams that they turn into projects in their lives. They spend their lives in carrying out their plans, which could be: making career, getting married, having a big house, having children and so on. So, dreams are not something out of real world, as they can often turn into reality. Moreover, imagination can keep people having a common dream together.
According to this, some people can make close friends or enter into relations (or love affairs!) with others to reach the common goal together. This proves the importance of mantaining dreams and imagination alive.
In conclusion, even if our modern society is dominated by technology, computers and scientific experiments, we should always keep a place for dreams and imagination. We should slow down our life rhythm and our preoccupation with progress and, on the contrary, think more of our dreams. Nowadays, life is very hard and sometimes only fantasy can give us an instant of breath and then help us in overcoming life`s great obstacles.

The word which is mostly applied to our society is *materialistic* and the typical description of modern man is certainly sad: always hurrying to work, always trying to earn as much money as possible and always thinking that people who are not strong enough to fight for their place in the world will certainly meet with failure. Therefore it is undeniable that our society does not give us many opportunities of freeing our imagination and dreaming: but does this mean that we do not want to dream any longer? Would not we sometimes give everything we own to have a few hours to lay down and read a book or listen to our favourite music? Many people would answer that what we really need is to be efficient and *produce* as much as possible, but I believe that what we should be does not always correspond with what we wish to be.
First, I would like to consider all those new techniques and methods which are becoming very successful and which have the purpose of restoring the contact between man and the deepest part of himself. I am speaking about yoga or the New Age philosophy of life, which both aim at teaching how to forget the daily stress, how to concentrate and relax and, above all, how to rediscover the power of human mind. More and more people are applying to the many courses which take place in big and small cities, thus showing their deep unfulfilment, their need of discovering a new aspect of life and, above all, of setting their mind free.
The second reason why I think that modern man is still trying to find a way toward dreams and imagination is that he is willing to learn how to appreciate the value of a close contact with nature. Those people who can afford it leave their sad flat in town and go to live in the country. Big towns are seen as places where human mind is never *at leisure*, never goes *on holiday*, whereas in the country our imagination is free to wander, our eyes reach the horizon line and start thinking about the world beyond it. Many people are also getting involved in programmes which aim at protecting the few *uncontaminated* areas of our planet, the ones which man has not reached yet, which are seen as the only places where human mind can recreate itself. All this proves that the contrast between what is *natural* and what is *artificial*, which was created during the Industrial Revolution to give voice to man's horror toward the destruction of nature and its beauty as a source of happiness, is still crucial today.
As a third and fundamental thing I would like to take into consideration those phenomenons such as drugs-addiction or alcoholism, which I see as extreme methods to find a way-out from our hectic modern life. We know that hallucinogenic drugs and alcohol can give people the impression of entering another world, where everything is easy and relaxing: these are the *new dreams*, this is the proof that human mind, still in need of something more than what money can buy, is trying to find a help, unfortunately in the wrong way.
As a conclusion, I want to say that even if in our modern world there is no longer a place for dreaming and imagination, they still have a place inside us all, because it is man who does not want to destroy them.

ITVE3003,3.5,4.0,,,,,Most university degrees are theoretical and do not prepare students for the real world. They are therefore of very little value,"
In Italy it is true that most university degrees are theoretical, meaning that they supply notions which have not a concrete application in the daily life. But it is over-simplified to claim that they do not prepare their students for the real world. Indeed, what *real world* means should be examined closely because this is an expression that can have more than one meaning. Therefore can people say that most university degrees, because theoretical, are of very little value? It depends on the meaning you apply to the phrase *real world*.
If this expression alludes to job we can claim that a theoretical learning does not prepare students for it. From this point of view university degrees are not much esteemed. This is particularly true for the humanist universities. A lot of students attending these kind of faculties have got the aim of becoming teachers but, even if provided with a wide learning, they are not given specific courses for this profession. On the contrary this does not happen in Germany, where who decides to go in this profession has not only the possibility to take a vast number of courses concerning it but these courses are considered fundamental and so they are compulsory. Moreover the students that are not interested in teaching are not educated for any specific job because the notions furnished are many and not focused on a particular subject in order to provide the concrete and specific learning that every profession needs. As a matter of fact students studyng modern languages go working in the most different fields and, apart from the knowledge of foreign speeches, all that they have studied has no concrete application.
Also some scientific universities do not prepare for a job. There students study lots and lots of abstract and complex rules which are not requested when they get a job. Most jobs need very concrete and practical notions that nowadays are acquired when people go working.
*Real world* does not only refer to the professional field but also to the area of the relationships and of the dialogue among people. In this case, speaking about the humanist universities, a theoretical education can be valuable because it gives the chance to open the minds and help to build a critical and more tolerant way of thinking. The fact of reading, reflecting and going deep into the thoughts of many famous writers and philosophers demands a dialectical attitude that usually enriches those who adopt it. Even if you consider areas of learning such as, for example, economics, law or science among the huge quantity of informations that they provide there are some that will be useful in the professional field but also some that, not employed, will be forgotten. In any case even the part of knowledge which will not find a concrete application in a profession, and so remain theoretical, is useful because it makes students strenghen their memory and accustom their mind to receive new imputs.
Even if most university degrees are theoretical we cannot say that they are of little value in the real life. This because universities are institutions aimed to provide not only a professional learning but also a development and an opening of mind. And nobody can deny that the real world does not only concern the job but also the human relationships.

""WOMAN STABBED TO DEATH"", ""YOUNG BOY (10) MISSING IN LESUND"", ""LARGE QUANTITY OF COCAINE CONFISCATED IN OSLO"".
These are all main headlines we often hear of in the news. Crime has become a very common word these days. No matter where you are in the world, it will always exist.
Crime is an old ""sport"" which has been around for hundreds of years. You do not have to be in any good physical condition to join in, any ages above 16 are accepted and the ""teams"" are always recruited. But mind you. The membership can be pretty expensive. Unfortunately not everyone joins the ""team"" voluntarily. Some just have to make a living out of it to be able to survive.
Thanks to the technical revolution the crimes today are more advanced and much more difficult to discover than what they were back in the old days. ""Modern crime"" is something we hear a lot of. Forgery of money and credit cards, embezzlement and transactions are some examples of crime, which goes under this category. Well-educated adults are the largest group of ""participants"" within ""Modern crime"". The investigation of such crimes can take quite a long time to solve because it usually involves computers and other advanced equipment. Many times the crime is not even discovered. Because of its advancement and large amount of money, which is involved, many governments around the world take these methods of crime very seriously. The punishment is therefore quite strict, some countries more then others of course.
What happened to the ""old fashion crime""? I am sorry to say that this kind of crime is still on the marked, and it is quite ""popular"" too. The largest group of ""players on this team"" is between eighteen and forty years of age. Crime such as stealing cars, braking in to others houses and murder are some of the crimes the police has to deal with almost daily. These criminal acts are, in many cases, easier to discover and solve, but the punishment is not necessarily milder.
What may seem unthinkable and hard to understand for many of us is that some people commit crimes just for the fun of it. For some this is their way of getting attention. I believe many also regret it when they get caught.
In Norway the prisons are quite nice comparing to prisons in other countries. The inmates are allowed to have TV, radio and some even have videogames and computers. So what is the bad part of being behind bars? For many, for example drug addicts, which do not have a roof over their heads every day, this must be like a vacation at a three stars hotel?
When you are young and naive you tend to live in the moment without thinking of what your past can do to your future. Many young criminals seem to think that dropping out of school, going in and out of jail is not too bad. Well, it destroys opportunities for you later in life. You will always have a criminal record, and you will not be allowed to visit curtain countries outside Europe. Most importantly it scars you for life.
Does crime pay?
In the end I do not think it is worth taking the risk.

NOAC1005,4.0,3.0,,,,,Crime does not pay,"
I remember the first time my mom caught me with my hands way down in the cookie jar. I wasn't very old at the time, probably about four or five years old. Still I remember it as if it happened yesterday. She wasn't angry, but calmly she told me to ask first.
I guess most people have experienced somewhat the same thing. Children are told, very early, not to steal and not to be mean to others. As we grow up we tend to pay little attention to those guiding words. We all know that in the end crime doesn't pay, still there is this inner force driving us all into some sort of crime. We all commit smaller crimes at some stage in our lives. For example when one is out driving, one is tempted to bend the speed limits a little. When speeding you know you're doing something wrong, still it's so tempting. We don't always consider the consequences of our actions until it's too late.
Some sort of crime has existed throughout history and wrongdoers have been punished or imprisoned. The societies' reactions have always been crucial when it comes to preventing crime. Many criminals, i.e. Al Capone, have been glorified by media, especially by movies and television. This glorification has misled many unfortunate souls into the idea that a life of crime is a life of sunshine. For instance when I watch movies like ""The Godfather"" or ""The Untouchables"" I often drift into dreams of being either Michael Corleone (The Godfather) or Al Capone (The Untouchables). The lives of these mobsters are portrayed in such a way that it's almost impossible to think that their actions are wrong. I know that they are criminals but still their way of life with easy money, fast cars and gorgeous women sort of takes the focus off the fact that they commit serious crimes.
In today's Norway we have long lines of people waiting for their trials. Many of those don't even get tried. This inefficiency in the legal system sets a bad example for coming generations. People may be tried for crimes they committed some two or more years ago; in the meantime they have lived ""free"" lives like anyone else. Many of those mentioned above commit new crimes waiting for their upcoming trial. For some of us this may mean that it doesn't matter if we do something illegal, we won't get sentenced anyways.
When we as children are being told that crime does not pay, we are presented with an illusion. In the real world it's almost as if crime pays. This development is in my opinion going the wrong direction. If we want our children to become law-abiding citizens, we need to take action. The first step would be to make the legal system more effective. We also need to work more on rehabilitation of criminals. I believe that the police should be granted more power in the fight against the growth of crime. Morals and ethics should play an important role in young children's education, more than it does today at least.
As a conclusion I would say that crime does not pay, although it may seem so sometimes. Our past eventually catches up with us, and then we will all have to face our wrongdoings. The fight against crime is both time-consuming and it demands resources that could have been better spent in other areas.

It is my opinion that in Norwegian schools the focus is too much on grades and reading. That is why a lot of people finish high school and still don't have a clue what they want to study further. In today's society high school is no longer enough to get a good job. Today's society requires more education. Instead of starting an education that might be wrong for you and put a lot of time and money in to that, an/or start working and for instance get dependant of a steady income which makes it harder to return to school. It is possible to set up an educational system that can prevent this from happening.
In ninth grade in my school in Norway, we had one week to try a profession to give us some experience. However one week in ninth grade can hardly qualify. We need more time to try different things to discover what we are good at and want to do for a living.
I think there should be an equal amount of studying theory as there should be using your mind and body solving practical issues, in the schools early on. If this can become a natural part of school the benefits are many.
A person experiencing life through books is missing out on a lot of what real life has to offer. The one's who are used to sit around in front of a computer and read a lot, should get a chance to socialize with others. They should also work with people, cooperate with them and experience how to get a long with people of different backgrounds. In short they can see for themselves what real world is like and put theory in to practice. Sometimes theoretical people cannot imagine how things will be once they are put in to life. For example after the Second World War in Norway they were going to build a new hospital in Finmark. What happened was that they build the doors to small for the hospital beds and the project cost more than it had to and took longer to complete.
Students who don't have very good theoretical skills, can prove themselves in a practical way instead. If schools were better at supporting and making it easier for students to use their practical skills in everyday school I feel everyone would have a more equal chance of being successful and no one is labelled an outcast. It is easier to confirm and show that everyone has a purpose and everyone has the same value as everyone else. In an even greater perspective, it can also prevent people from ending up with a life of crime and drug-, alcohol-, and gambling abuse.
The cost of putting more focus on practical skills in schools may be a reason why this has yet to be put into action. To solve this problem companies can support the system financially. This would only benefit the companies later, when they whish to hire new people, they will get people who are more diverse and flexible.

I say that the world is still open for changes, new ideas and improvement, which leaves lots of room for both dreaming and imagination.
The year is 2001 and yes we have come quite far in the development of science technology and are a lot more experienced in such areas than say just twenty years ago. Still the expansion of technology is not completely world spread. It is limited to the countries with the right economy to be able to experiment and try out new paths on the way to becoming an even more advanced society. Take for example the third world. How much knowledge do they have about technical equipments? They have more than enough with providing food on the table and shoes on their feet to be thinking about industrialization. Dreams are certainly a part of their everyday life and for many probably the only thing that keeps them going and not giving up even at times when things seem pretty hopeless. The dream of a roof over their head, end of starvation and misery and one day to live in a peaceful world which are things that we and the people who say there is no room for dreams, take for granted, but they are dreams and no one can take that away from them.
Stating that the time of dreaming and imagination is over is quite a sad statement. Without dreams and hopes how will the world move forward? With so much information and knowledge we now sit with, the possibilities of achieving new goals and accomplishing our dreams are even greater. So why stop? Why discourage, when encouraging the progress of development is the most logic thing to do. Why satisfy with what we have now if the ability of reaching our imaginative perfect world lies in the hands of the dreamers. Think if you were able to fulfill the one dream you have had for the last three years. Would not this give you the courage to go for your next dream or make the first one even better? What if people had the same attitude when the computer was made. Internet would not have been here today. The computers abilities are expanding just as I am writing this essay and for that we can thank the ones who had a dream of making the computer to something more than just a typing machine.
Science technology and industrialization will not get any further if imagination is given up. I believe that the world is still full of dreams just waiting to be exposed to the public as a positive achievement, maybe a new step in manhood, just like the first step on the moon or the first transportation of food and clothes to needy people in a war-area. But of course, it does not have to be as drastic as that. Dreams can be as innocent as a little girls dream of becoming a ballet dancer or being asked to the prom by the guy she has had her eye on the last three months, it can be a students` dream of passing on a final exam to go on to law school or a football teams` dream of winning the world championship for the first time.
According to my opinion, there will always be a place for dreaming and imagination. In a way I feel sorry for people with no dreams. I think they are missing out on something for what could possibly feel better than accomplishing your goals? Dreams are forever, whether big or small!

NOAC1015,3.5,,,,,,Most university degrees are theoretical and do not prepare students for the real world. They are therefore of very little value,"
MOST UNIVERSITY DEGREES ARE THEORETICAL AND DO NOT PREPARE STUDENTS FOR THE REAL WORLD.THEY ARE, THEREFORE, OF VERY LITTLE VALUE.
Looking at people with university degrees and people without degrees can sometimes be the same. Why is this a question that often comes to my mind?I have found myself often wondering if universeties and higher degrees really is nessesary to live a good life, like they say it is.""They"" would be your teachers, parents and other people older than you, which seem to think that you can't live a good life without a good degree which could give you a good job and a lot of money.You can live a good life without all the theoretical things you learn at the university. So I cann't see why we should waste time and money on going to university when we can do just as well without it.
By saying this people can look at you strangely.How can a young person with the whole life infront of her say something like that.They will all say that school is very important and that you need an university degree to live a good life.Some people would not agree with that.A lot of people in this world today, live a perfectly good life without having a university degree.Just think about our grand parents, great grand parents and ancesters .Some of them didn't og to school at all and some might have gone a few years.Some learned to read and write at church,while others learned from friends and family.
Most of the things we seem to learn in High school is to prepare us for University or college.What about those people who are not going to og to university,should they just drop out of high school too?Then when you og to university you learn theories on things that we do not nesseceraly need in real life.It's more effective to be taught your job or profecion at a company or factory, rather than sit in a classrom and listen to professors going on and on for hours about things you might never do your self.
Universeties don't seem to be as serious as we think it should be.There are proffesors that are bad and that not really know what they are talking about or you can get those who think they know everything but does't know how to teach it to you.Some doesn't even prepare their lections so you cann't follow on what they are saying.Another factor could be that they are to young,which can make them og along with the students perfectly outside the lection room, but then get lack of respectin the class.This will then desterb you and your classmates.
Then on the other hand universeties to day are very expencive,which makes it hard for a lot of people to join the universeties.So that kind of means that,ok if you have money you can learn all these different theories and other things, but if you are poor you cann't.The people that cann't affored it can sometimes reach higher up in society than people with degrees from university.The point being that if all people cann't get the opportunety for an equal education ,it should not be that important either. A lot of people have to work a lot during the time they spend at the university ,to be able to pay for it and some like their jobs so much that they just drop out.Still doing well whitout all the theory from the university.
When getting a degree you should at least be able to get a better job than people that do not have it.Unfortunatly that is not the way it is. People that are working as substitutes often get more payed and just as good jobs as people with degrees.That also happens even though the substitute does not have a degree.So in other words the universeties do not necesseraly prepare you to og out and live in the real world. It may seem that the universeties are useing the wrong methods for getting the students on the right track for life.You can be self-taught,as well as have a good degree and both do bad or well.So the conclusion would be: Why waste money and time on things you can learn elsewhere than in a universety!

The prison system is outdated. No civilised society should punish its criminals: it should rehabilitate them.
We have had the prison system for a long time now. To punish the criminals with prison has been our answer to what we mean they deserve after a violation of the law. To hide them behind locked doors and walls. The prison in these days specially in Norway are pretty nice. The sets of furniture are good, the food they get is good, and the prisoners also get to watch TV if they want. Their punishment is just to be locked up. After spending some time in prison they are supposed to go back to society, and live a ""normal"" life. Does this work?
When the prisoners get out of jail they often commit new violations of the law. Some the same day they get out, some after a few months and some after years. Why? Didn`t they learn something at all while they were locked up? I have worked at a mental institution for one year. While I was working there, we had several patients who were criminals, and many of them also had drugproblems. I know that this was not the right place for them, but neither was the prison. We often heard that when they got out, they came back very soon. I have a friend who works as a prison guard. She told me that they had a psychiatrist working with them, but that was one psychiatrist alone on maybe fifty prisoners. And many of them didn`t even want to see him. So there were just a few of them who got treatment. To punish a child after he/she has done wrong, is something many parents do because they want the child to learn what's right and wrong while its in the learning process. To do this with a grown up is wrong I believe, because the grown up knows what he or she did was wrong. So no one needs to teach them about that, the criminal needs to learn how to get rid of the desire to break the law. That`s the difference. That is also why I think that criminals need rehabilitation instead of punishment in prison.
This rehabilitation should be just for criminals, and there should be plenty of psychiatrists working there. The reason for that is that the psychiatrists are experts on way of resolving a problem, and the criminal is an expert on him or her self. So here we need a perfect teamwork, otherwise the treatment will never give results. I think the ""punishment"" should be psychich. The criminals should feel bad about themselves, they should feel naked and vulnerable. Then the psychiatrists should help them to get back their selfesteem.
In many countries people can condemn someone to death. For me that seems insane. Murderes are sick, very sick, they really need treatment. In my opinion only God can condemn who should live or die, not people. It`s a very simpel solution; ""he is a problem in the society, let him die""
After having conversations with criminals while I was working in the mental institution, I saw very clearly that these people had a lot of resources. You just had to look for them a while. In many cases they have never used these resources, or not even knew they had them.
I think that one time in the future this problem will be preferable, because I think more people will understand that when you have done something wrong you don't have to be punished with prison. There is a reason that you did it, and it`s the reason we have to focus on. We have enough resources to do something with this problem, and even though people in Norway aren`t satisfied with the prison system or the public health services, it is quite good compared to other countries. This is a very important them that demand a lot of work and planning. But I think we have something going on, at least that we are moving in the right direction.

NOAC1017,3.0,3.5,,,,,The prison system is outdated. No civilized society should punish its criminals: it should rehabilitate them,"
There are almost 2 million Americans in prisons in the U.S. today. Many of these criminals go in and out of jail their whole life. Prisons are the perfect school for criminals. They can go in with a ""Bachelor"" degree in stealing cars, and then a few years later they can come out with a ""Masters"" degree in narcotic smuggling. The criminals often share information ""in the joint"" about what they know best, usually criminal stuff.
What can this world give the criminals in prison after they have served their time? It is hard to imagine how it must be. Serving years behind bars and then trying to blend in to our society. First of all, things change and the life they knew isn't the same any more after all those years. They have to adapt to ""our new"" world. This must be very difficult for them. Getting a job is important, but who wants an ex-criminal with a criminal record to work for them? If they fail getting a job, they often do what they know they do best, criminal stuff.
The prisons system should help the prisoners to get a new start in life. Help them with a college degree, or train them to be able to get some kind of a descent job after they are done serving there time. Let them work and feel that they are a part of something important and are needed in society.  But most of all show them there is more to life than being a criminal. It is possible to make descent money doing ""normal"" stuff.
The most important issue to help prisoners with, that will later live in our community, is to help them understand that they cannot keep on disobeying the law. Everybody should be able to talk to a psychiatrist, or some person that will help him or her in his or her situation they now have to serve time in jail for.
Putting the prisoners ""away"" in jail cells will usually not help the prisoners, especially later on in life. After being stuck in a cell for many years, like an animal in a cage, away from any kind of freedom, the prisoners will probably have more problems when they get out, than when they where put in.
The jail system needs to be changed. For thousands of years we've locked criminals up in prisons. There have to be other solutions.
There is a reason why criminals get caught for something illegal again and again and are put back in jail. But why anyone would dare disobeying the law ever again after serving time in prison, is outrageous, but happens too often and shows that serving time in prison does not help nor change the prisoners lifestyle.
A descent job would definitely be a huge lift for them in changing their lifestyle. That is why they need help in prison, talk to psychiatrists or people who can help them and working so they can feel good about themselves and not wanting to go back to there old lifestyle as criminals.
All of these issues are depending on one thing. Money. The taxpayers are the ones who will suffer for all the ""help"" the criminals in prison will need. But thinking in longer terms, money will probably be saved because of less criminal activity.

NOAC1023,4.0,3.0,,,,,Crime does not pay,"
A crime is a felony, which is when you do something that is against a law. A crime can also be something that is just morally wrong. You can for example break in to a store, rape a person or speed on the road. As most times when you do something illegal you get caught. That is a reason why crime does not pay.
When a person does a serious crime he will most likely have to pay for it. And it is not just talking about money, because that is just a small reaction to a crime. If you are a first-time criminal you can get off with only a fine, but it will depend on what you have done and what kind of intentions you had when you did the crime. If you already have a criminal record you will most likely have to go to jail.
A crime can and often will give you a sentence. Your life will be changed no matter what. You cannot do an illegal thing and not expect to get some kind of punishment from it. If you go to prison it probably will not be easy. In a prison your inmates will treat you good or bad. It sometimes depends on what you have done. People in prison have feelings too, so if you have killed your baby for example you might get in trouble with the inmates. They might not approve of what you have done even if they also have committed a crime. We often see in movies that prisoners get raped by their cellmates or even sometimes get killed.
In Norway, I think that we have better prisons then for examples the US. The prisoners here can often serve an open sentence. That means that they will work outside the prison during the day, but when work is finished s/he has to go back to the prison. The prisoners here do often just serve a third part of what they are sentenced to do. We have secure prisons too, but I think the Norwegian prisons are too good. The people in the cells have good food, TV and all kinds of equipment that poor people does not have. The prisoners should not have it better then other people living in our society.
In some cases people are so helpless that they go out and do a crime just to get in to jail so that they can survive. When they are in jail they have a bed, food and good facilities. That is much better then have to find food in the garbage bin and to sleep on the street. In these cases it might be that crime does pay, but is it worth it?
A criminal who is sentenced will always carry a scar from the crime. It is a scar that other people cannot see. He will always have a criminal record, so when he will apply for a job he will have to tell the employer that he has been to jail for a regulation against the law. Even if the lawbreaking was long ago and that he regrets it, it often has nothing to say. There are not many people who will hire a person, which has done something bad like steeling. It is always a risk that it can happen again. If you cannot get a job I would say that you have thrown your life away. If you do not have a job it is hard to survive in the world, and it is so much easy to get back to the criminal ways again.
There are reasons for and against that crime does not pay. Often people do a crime just to get some kind of attention. It might be a cry for help or just a sick mind. But there is always a reason behind a criminal act. As long as the world continues, the crime will carry on. There is too much difference in the world for the criminal to stop. In my opinion a crime does not pay, no matter what. A person will always feel guilty for what he has done and if he gets caught it is even worse for him. So crime does not pay.

NOAG1004,3.0,2.5,,,,,Crime does not pay,"
What is crime? In our world different cultures have different answers to this question. That's also why people sometimes are punished for things we didn't even know were illegal. Such an event might take place if a European travels to Asia. The governments of our world have enough to think about if they should not also have to enlighten people from other countries around the would what we may receive the death penalty for in their country, but not even be put a finger on in other countries, for instance adultery.
Crime can be divided into 3 main boxes: THEFT, VIOLENCE and SEX. To mention some sub- boxes we have fraud and robbery in THEFT, murder and fighting in VIOLENCE and incest and necrophilia in SEX. These are just a few examples out of many, but all crimes will eventually derive from at least one of the 3 main boxes.
So what causes crime? THEFT is most certainly caused by poverty, but also greed and lack of respect of others' property. VIOLENT crimes happen as a result of anger, but also in coalition with THEFT and/ or SEX crimes. SEX crimes happen because of repressed sexuality, but also as a result of people's sexual nature. What is looked upon as crime varies a lot between different countries, as mentioned before. The trend is that Western countries have a more liberal view as well as softer punishment for crimes. The exception is USA, which still has the death penalty in many states.
So how is crime stopped? Police is the number one physical crime- stopper with millions of police officers worldwide. These uphold order by their presence in the streets, but it's the arrestations and jailing of criminals that really rids the society of its unwanted.
Before this stage though, the entire social network of a ""criminal to be"" is able to prevent crime by not causing it. In our world only coincidence creates good or evil; where we grow up, which fiends we have, which girlfriends/ boyfriends we get or do not get, which possibilities/ abilities we have and not least how people treat us. Still, personal interests like greed and gormandision will make us cross the border to crime without regard to our personal environment or past events in our lives if it suits us right.
So why then does not crime pay? Surely when we steal a purse with 1000 in it we are 1000 richer! Or when we rape a beautiful girl we are an orgasm richer! It's hard to argue with these statements. Our conscience is often a low threshold to climb when we think of the prize we gain from committing a certain crime. And when wee know that at least 50% of crimes committed will not be discovered and brought to justice, the chance of ""getting away with it"" is sufficient to encourage us to go through with our sinful deeds.
But if we want to scare criminals from committing their deeds, we can explain our brethren and sisthren what would happen if everybody did what they do: THE WORLD WOULD BE EXTINCT. And that would surely not pay. We could also put them to jail, where the incomes aren't lucrative.
Nevertheless, without crime all policemen would be out of work, everybody would need a job and God would hardly have any sinners to forgive. Would you push the button if it meant crime would be abolished?
To conclude, there are probably more people who are happy about having crime than there are those who aren't. Still, only the wicked and the scruple- less gains from crime. The rest of us good citizens will have to make our wealth the hard way. Until we decide to do something else...

NOAG1011,3.0,3.0,,,,,"Some people say that in our modern world, dominated by science and technology and industrialisation, there is no longer a place for dreaming and imagination. What is your opinion?","
Our world is on a constant path of change. Nothing really ever stays the same. The so-called modern world will not be so modern a bit further on in the future. So how do we define our modern world? Is it all the technology we've come up with or is it just another way to describe today's society? And what meaning do we put into the words of dreaming and imagination?
We call our world a modern one because we have invented and put to life things that perhaps wasn't even thought about in old times. In one way we have made life easier than it was back then. The telephone, the computer, the car are things that are made to simplify our lives. Yet, in many ways they do the exact opposite. But the intention tends to be simplicity and pleasure.
Human-beings are creativity themselves. They like to make dreams into reality. It's almost a sign of success. The author Jules Verne already wrote about travelling under water long before the first submarine saw the day. Unthinkable in his time, reality in our time. Man has always looked up to the stars, wondering. Today we still haven't reached the stars out there, but we are on our way. But if it wasn't for dreams and people's imaginations, we would still just wonder.
For some, dreaming is what we do during sleep. Imagination is for those who have their noses buried in books that tell tales of fantasy worlds. But to dream is to learn, and to imagine is to live.
People have been dreaming and using their imagination since the beginning of time. Dreaming is what makes the world go round. The way of life which is dominated by science technology and industrialisation was, and still is, created by people who dream and who uses their imagination to put these dreams to life. These dreams are our world. The way people dream today may not be the same as the dreams of older generations. Life changes and so do dreams.
Children are very good at dreaming and imagining things. It is said that all the movies and computer games ruin the child's fantasy and it's ability to make-believe. Perhaps it instead has changed the way children use their imagination? Seeing, feeling and experiencing things can be a seed to imagination. We are told that reading books increases the capability of imagination. But not everybody needs books to do so. Nevertheless, books are a path towards imagination.
But, dreaming is also about escaping reality for a while. Life runs fast today and dreaming can be a way to pause for a moment. Letting the mind wonder off on it's own can work as therapy. All the things you want to do or not do, to become or not become, can be real in your imagination. And this is something people need, but not all are aware of.
No matter how ""modern"" the world becomes, there will always be room for dreaming and for imagination. Creativity and ambition is our driving force, and is what will make us continue to dream and to imagine.

NOAG1013,3.0,2.5,,,,,Feminists have done more harm to the cause of women than good,"
In USA, Europe, Australia and in Scandinavian, in countries with developed western culture and thinking, woman have achieved a positition that gives her all basic rights as regards to education and study, religious performences and believes, to ways of living and to work and career. Even in some countries legislation gives her preferences to certain political and work positions and statuses just because she is woman.
Besides this achievements, the woman has gained understandness and respect from men, as this is what the women's fight concerns about-the liberation from men's suppression.
This long women struggle to achive equal possibillities in life and living, respect both being a woman and a person is long time ago fullfilled in the western culture. Their faight is over. The feminists work is succeeded and all men agree that they have done a most marvelous and highly nessessary work.
However, we have seen during the two last decades that feminists objectives have turned into extremeties. Equally rights and respect and possibillities are no longer enough. Feminists objectives are now to be superior to men- in all aspects and on all levels. And if they do not fine goals to fight for at home, they find abroad, but fight them from save positions from homeland.
Not long ago I read an interveiw with a nearly fourty year old woman. She worked ver hard and long and ahs given career first priority. However, she sais that he had a man who had given her a child and to whom she was married.
This way of perform life and living, to look upon man's role has become common and fully acceptable today. Man's role is being a fertilizer fullfilling woman's prestige to give birth and prove her womanhood.
More and more women seems to look upon men as a practical object, useful to have at hand when needed for different purposes.
Asking young women today what they features and characters they prefer with a future husbond, they will strongly underline that he must be rich in money, have a good job, a nice house and a fast car, and that he must be kind in the sence that he is very generous to her.
Hard values as money, status and position, etc are today dominent preferences to men.
Looking women today you will observe more and more confirmity with women. Personal identity and individuality are disappering. This confirmities you now can see in women's behavior, dressing, attitude, living and careers, and not least in their personal appearence. It seems to men, very unfortunately that to look like a manis most popular. Sometime even an experienced eye hardly catch the difference, if the person you look at is male or female.
Idealistic struggles when loosing objectives to fight for, too often turns into exstremeties, and so also with the western feminists fights. Objects become more peculiar, and it now seems that the main object is to be superior to men. And to have the slightest possibillities to gain an objective as this, to gain attentions and support, the feminists fighters must exaggerate, and exaggeration leads to vulgarity. Bad behavior and living, swearing, drunkness, drugs, etc, etc, what earlier were men's ""exclusive privileges"" are now fully atapded and accepted by women and seems now more common among women than men. To be bisexual and to perform bisexualities makes you a modern woman and gives you prestige.
From men's point of view the feminists have turned or transformed women into unpersonal objects. It seems to men that modern women are not allowed - or not so free - that she does not dare show that she is a woman, dare not show her femininity. Modern feminism has made femininity something shamefull. Even better under Talibanlike regimes - at least you know that under this dress is a woman.
Maybe men are too romantic. But for more and more western men, the modern feminist struggles and fights and influence on women seems to have killed feminism and where are the feminine women. This kind of feminist behavior and performance make men run away in distress and frustration. Modern feminism will turn back upon the women themselves, as the man will not allow feminists to disturb his nature born basic instincts.
More and more western men turns their back to their native women and look for partners and wifes in other cultures where preferences and values are others, where he feels cared for and where home, children and family still are dominating and most valuables factor for live and living. Or expressed by five men I happened to meet in an East European county's restaurant some years ago: -""We are looking for a feminine woman - feminist we have enough of at home.""

NOAG1015,4.0,3.0,,,,,Crime does not pay,"
According to the Concise Oxford Dictionary crime is ""an action which constitutes a serious offence against an individual or the state and is punishable by law"". Cultural and religious differences along with secularization and changes in time make ""serious offence"" a changing notion. Some ideas of crime are universal, while some kinds of actions are accepted in parts of the world, and made punishable elsewhere. This essay will discuss the consequences of committing crime. The basis of this essay will be in the Norwegian administration of justice.
In Norway all criminals are punished either economically, with community work, by sentencing s/he to prison, or one can given a combination of these. The punishment is given according to a different number of factors. Economical punishment is given with basis in the criminal's income, which means that rich people are forced to pay a higher amount of money than not so wealthy people. Prison is given for more serious crime, and one's freedom is taken away. The criminal is locked up in a little room and has little control over his/her own life. The type and length of punishments are under constant discussion.
Crime is punished in all societies. Still crime can pay. In most societies there is a long way from crime to punishment. In Norway the police investigates all reported criminal actions. The suspected is entitled to defend him/herself, s/he will not be punished before the trail is over, and the person is found guilty. This is a complicated system, and the period from a crime is committed, until a possible punishment, is often long. This rewards the criminal.
Many criminals get away with their crime. The investigation of the police does not always succeed. In Norway in 1999, 31% of the reported crime that was investigated were cleared up. Thus very many criminals are never arrested and will never be punished, which means that crime does pay! Nevertheless 97% of all murder cases and 89% of all drug crimes were solved. But only 12% of reported thefts is solved, which makes the total percentage of solved crimes this low. (SSB, 2000)
In many reported cases the police cannot prove who did the crime, thus many criminals get away. They might know who did it, but they do not have the evidence needed to prove it, hence they cannot arrest him/her. This often happens in cases concerning rape and violence. Often there are few witnesses, drugs involved, and the case often ends in word against word. The number of dismissed cases is constantly increasing.
Punishment is given for three reasons: to punish the criminal, prevent him/her from doing wrong again and prevent others from committing crime. As I have pointed out, many criminals go free, and often the punishment cannot prevent people from repeating illegal actions. On the other hand, there are reasons, in addition to the punishment, that makes crime no good friend.
Many ex-criminals, who have done their time, have a hard time getting a job after being in prison. Who wants to employ an ex-criminal? Can you trust an ex-criminal to work for you?
Secondly, the society often has another kind of punishment. When the criminals, who are supposed to be free and forgiven, return from prison, the person is often pushed out of society. The family is, in many cases mistreated too, children might be crowded in school, the marriages of criminals often fails etc. In America, they have put up posters outside pedophiles houses to tell that here lives an criminal, which adds up to the fear and the gossip, and society treats these men almost like animals.
Thirdly, criminals that get away with their crime, often regret the rest of their life. Their conscience haunts them and many suffer from both physical and psychological illness.
Make a little mistake in life and you can end up in jail. Many good people serve their time and want to begin a better life after the sentence, but the crime they did often follow them, and they regret and suffer their whole life.
There are reasons to think one might get away with a crime, as I have pointed out, many often do! Many think the time to serve is worth the risk. But altogether the punishments both from state and society are not worth a possible gain. Crime does not pay.

NOBE1002,2.5,2.0,,,,,"Some people say that in our modern world, dominated by science and technology and industrialisation, there is no longer a place for dreaming and imagination. What is your opinion?","
""Time is money"" is a frequently used expression in our modern world, and this term reflects important and central concerns in the present way of living
Some major reasons to this are the development of science technology and the industrialisation which have found place with swift speed during the last decades in our society. In connection to this developement materialism has become a well known term, and to many people the possession of objects and how to get a hold of them have grown to be their major interest in life. Combined with the rapid development the question is wether these materialistic concerns leave us some time dreaming and using our imagination, which I am going to focus this essay on.
A characteristic feature of our modern community is the time pressure mainly caused by the swift progress in science technology and the industrial world, which steadily present new inventions, discoveries or products to us.
These presentations are particularly made by different mass medias and because of the great number of television -and radiochannels and various newspapers, we have to spend a lot of time selecting important information. If we not bother to do this, we may not be able to participate in discussions related to important matters in our society.
In many cases commercial advertisement make us think that we need this paricular product, and since possession of objects are essential to a lot of people, they spend much time getting a hold of these products. Another vital result of the development is the replacement of machines to do work previously done by human beings, and using machines instead of human work force also means that the machines do the thinking instead of us and they also work faster than we would have done.
When time is money and dreaming does not give you any financial profit, some people might say that dreaming is a waste of time, but in my opinion it is very important to use your ability to dream. I believe that many people living in the modern world need for one moment to turn the focus away from real life and the increasing pressure which is connected to it.
In your imaginative world everything is possible, only you are able to decide what to think and dream about. In our society I think the opportunity to escape from real life and spend some time with your own dreams and thoughts is a necessity, because wielding your imagination do not cost you anything, which differs greatly from the materialistic world where we have to pay for almost everything. Emphasize on such a non-materialistic aspect is of great importance in a society whish so strongly focuses at possession of objects.
I believe that using your dreams and imagination will add a deeper meaning to life in a modern world where materialism easily leads to a superficial attitude to life.
It is a fact that a modern world dominated by science technology and industrialisation, resulting in a more rapid development and materialism, has given us less time to dream.
But I believe that most people, no matter how busy they are, spend some time to ""fly away"" from all worries in the real world.
Most importantly; this ability is a part of human nature; we are able to think and feel things, machines are not. Because of this very reason I think that there will always be space for dreaming and imagination in our modern world.

NOBE1004,3.5,,,,,,Most university degrees are theoretical and do not prepare students for the real world. They are therefore of very little value,"
There is no doubt that most university degrees are theoretical. They do not prepare students for the real world and are therefore of very little value. Students that graduate have studied for many years, but they have never tried out their theories in the real world. Everybody can read a book on mathematics or biology, but do they learn how to use it in their future profession? Nobody can argue that there is a great difference from reading about something and do it for real. It is sad when one after five or six years of studying find out that one do not fit in the profession one was aiming at. It goes without saying that an education is an expensive investment in one's future. If one is unfortunate enough one have to start all over again to get a new education that fits. This could have been discovered much earlier.
A great many student with university degrees become teachers. During their studies they do not have the opportunity to find out if they fit as teacher. They do their reading, but they do not know what is the most important to learn or how they can teach it to their future pupils. If they had a chance to do it practically in their studies they would know more about teaching. One need exercise to become a skilful teacher.
It is obvious that some people are better theoretical than practical and vice versa. Some students may get the best marks in the university, but they do not know how to do a day's work. On the contrary there are students who are good at practical work, but not at theoretical studies that are found in the university. Is it fair that those who get a degree with excellent marks should get the jobs that the latter could have done better? I guess there are a good many employers that would choose those who know how to work in the real world, and do not only have the knowledge of different theories. I personally hope so. At secondary school most of the teachers have graduated from a university. They know a good deal about their own subject, but do not know how to teach it to their pupils. What is the use of such teachers? One has to think about those who suffer damage namely the pupils.
In spite of the examples above, quite a few people argue that university degrees are valuable. Even though some students do not manage to relate their studies to the real world, a great many of them do. A number of people also claim that one have to know the theory before one gets a job. Theory forms the basis of good work. That may be true, but why do they not include practical work in the degrees like they do in for example training colleges? Then there would be both the theoretical aspect and the practical aspect. But that is not how the university functions. People at the university have attached importance to the theoretical aspect for many years now and will doubtfully change that in the next couple of years. It has always been like that. Maybe the system would be changed if there were granted more money. Until then we will have to deal with the theoretical degrees and hope that the students manage to relate their studies to the real world.
As we have seen there is a disagreement between those who believe that the university degrees are of little value and those who think that they are valuable. Still nobody knows what the future will bring. One day there may be a change that will prepare the students for the real world.

NOBE1008,3.0,,,,,,The prison system is outdated. No civilized society should punish its criminals: it should rehabilitate them,"
It has often been questioned whether society should punish or rehabilitate its criminals. Today's prison system has no room for rehabilitation, but is rather based on the deterrent system. The criminals, or the persons convicted, are supposed to be discouraged to commit any more criminal actions when released.
Some prisons already have a rehabilitation system, but it is not good enough. The system is based on different educational courses, courses levelled against the prisoner's attitude etc.. If one are supposed to be able to rehabilitate a notorious criminal, the criminal himself have to change his attitude (I choose to refer to the criminal as male, since most criminals, at least in Norway, are young males with lack of education) and frame of mind.
If the prisons should be transformed into rehabilitation centres for criminals, however, this may put the society to further expenses. After all, rehabilitation system do require more efforts than the system already does.
A rehabilitation programme is perhaps more necessary in some cases than in others, since there are some crimes which are more serious than others. A person who has committed murder or a rapist needs far more help than a notorious criminal, since this has to do with persons who are seriously mentally ill. On the other hand, a sort of rehabilitation programme is already established for such criminals, where they get mental help either in a penal or a mental institution.
Now it is not said that other criminals do not have the need for rehabilitation. Some crimes, such as crimes for profit, are perhaps easier to fall back on after serving their sentence. Here I would have to state an example to make my point more clear: A notorious criminal has committed several minor crimes, and gets eventually caught and imprisoned. When his sentence is served and he is released, what do he do? The one thing he knows: continues committing crimes because that is the only way of living that works for him, and it gives him some sort of an income. This notorious criminal is also aware of the fact that it is impossible for him to get a decent employment, since no employer would choose to have a person with a criminal record to work for him. The only course open to him is to continue as a criminal.
In such cases also is a rehabilitation programme a necessity in order to convince the offender that crime is not the only way out.
But there are of course those who intend to start over and continue their life in a respectful manner, it is not our purpose to generalise. But many ex-convicts experience that finding a job is difficult, even if they have the qualifications required. However, one can understand when an employer chooses someone with an unblemished record in preference to someone with a criminal record.
It is possible that a rehabilitation system in the prisons will make society change its view on criminals, so that they who wish could more easily adapt to society. Some would perhaps say that rehabilitation of criminals is only possible in an ideal world, that one can not change a persons personality. Nonetheless, it is up to the individual whether he wants to be rehabilitated or not, and in what degree. One can not force someone to become a better person. Some would even regard rehabilitation as a punishment as much as anything.
As the situation is the today, the prisons do not make their prisoners better persons, on the contrary. Some even become worse than before they were imprisoned. So if the prison system is to change, it is not only the inmates of the prison who have to change, but also the staff of the penal institutions.

NOBE1011,3.5,2.5,,,,,"In his novel ""Animal Farm"" George Orwell wrote ""All men are equal but some are more equal than others"". How true is this today?","
""All men are equal: but some are more equal than others."" What could be read into this statement is that all people should be equal but are, in fact, not. The satirical novel, Animal Farm, in which this sentence is found, is based on the Russian revolution in 1917.The political leaders, Josef Stalin and Leo Trotsky, are perfect examples of those more equal than others. By always putting their own wishes first, they turned an otherwise good thought, Lenin's idea of equality, into a revolution gone tragically wrong. This happened a very long time ago, but are conditions really any better today?
Discrimination against certain groups of people has more or less always existed. In recent years, however, this has generally become a smaller problem than it has been before, especially in the matter of public life and occupation. Women, as well as minority groups in white societies, have made great progress in their fight for equality, and organisations for this purpose are still working to improve their conditions. In spite of this, the ultimate goal remains to be reached.
Women are still having problems when it comes to equal pay for equal work and being promoted to prominent positions. The majority of these positions are still occupied by men, due to the fact that it is easier for them to climb the corporate ladder than it is for the female part of the population. Even in the British Parliament women are facing problems in being selected as parliamentary candidates and winning seats in the House of Commons.
Some religions are also cause of discrimination towards women. In Muslim countries, for instance, ladies are subdued by men and have to obey by their commands entirely. If not, banning and even death are common results. Since it is written in their holy book, the Koran, that men are superior, most people who are Muslims, accept this view on society. In recent years, however, more and more Muslim women are breaking out of this pattern.
Immigrants are often facing great problems in their new society. Employers will frequently choose not to hire those with a different skincolour, and problems in terms of language are significant obstacles. Furthermore, the adults are not the only ones who are given a hard time. Many immigrant children are having difficulties at school. Problems in adjusting to an entirely different culture and language barriers could lead to serious racial issues, which makes it difficult for them to develop in the right direction.
During the second World War, Nazism became a horrendous feature among Hitler's supporters. Even today the so called Neonazism is continuously growing. A few weeks ago this movement took racism to a new level by committing murder. A Norwegian teenager with a dark skincolour was killed by neonazis, an event which horrified the whole nation.
A totalitarian system of government could be said to support the statement that some are more equal than others. This is very similar to the way of ruling during the Russian revolution, and is presently seen in countries such as Zimbabwe, in which the inhabitants are forced to support the one political party in power.
In conclusion it should be stated that all men are not equal as seen from the examples of such mentioned above. The situation has, nonetheless, improved severely in recent years due to the different movements working for this cause. Regardless, George Orwell is still right by saying: ""All men are equal: but some are more equal than others.""

NOBE1013,3.5,2.5,,,,,Most university degrees are theoretical and do not prepare students for the real world. They are therefore of very little value,"
It is generally agreed that a university degree throughout story has been more of status than other educational achievements. Overall, the opinion of today`s majority is based on the same view.
Indeed, the university education leads to a great decline in academic standards. Upon that assumption, graduates should be perfectly prepared for his or her future profession. Of course, at some levels this is true. But what is not paid attention to according to this opinion, is the fact that most university degrees are more or less theoretical, and do not prepare students for the level of the real world. In other words, based on previous statement, the value of a university degree might be a topic for discussion.
One issue of entry is the stage of getting a job. You just graduated with a diploma displaying your brilliant academic ability. You occupy all the theoretical knowledge required. Perhaps you are young. Yet the overall fact is that employers do favour applicant`s earlier practical experience. As a result, practical experience might be hard to gain when your lack of it pulls you down on the rank of qualifications. Maybe involving obligatory practical training in university degrees would place one higher on this ranking list.
Another point of this matter would involve the next phase in the situation of a new job - the phase of beginning. You know the theoretical quota needed in this position, but you still need on-the-job training for this particular work place. Slightly more practical training in your university degree would conceivably curtail this procedure, a procedure known to effect the work for the inexperienced beginner, as well as for the colleagues and production. Beginners with no experience often cause delays on their work place; another factor influencing the employer`s preference of experienced applicants.
The main aspect is probably actuality of theory, indeed being divergent than real world. A medicine student might be a plodder who really devote his or her youth to books and studies. This devotion might secure students a diploma of excellence. But what the diploma does not tell the employer is whether this person occupy the social skills needed for a position as a doctor or not. There are several cases of medicine students spending most of their college life in their rooms studying to achieve good grades. And equally there are cases of these students, later on in doctor professions, not knowing how to treat or even talk to a client socially. In these circumstances, the value of the theoretical university degree might be questioned.
As has been noted, there are several reasons to introduce more practical training in the university degree, but one must not forget to look at this case from other aspects of perspective. Comparing a university degree with practical education systems, the heavy academic knowledge is, in a higher advanced quantity, generally found among the university students. And one must neither forget the importance of student`s possession of the theoretical academic knowledge.
So based on the discussion above, the first sentence in the topic statement: ""most university degrees are theoretical and do not prepare students for the real world."" Is an essential and correct statement, and a fact that should be attempted to be reformed. The second assertion: ""They are therefore of very little value."" Is, according reasoning argumentation above, probably not correct. As stated earlier in the text, the theoretical knowledge you get in a university degree is important as well as of high value. But the degree might have raised it`s value even higher if it would include more practical training.

NOBE1018,3.5,3.0,,,,,Crime does not pay,"
It is generally agreed that crime does not pay, regardless of the character of the crime.
The value and importance of leading an honest life is being taught and emphasized both by family and by society from early life. Nevertheless the expression is so well known and to a certain degree worn out, that most people use it without reflecting on the content of the statement. Is it really the case that crime does not pay?
There is no doubt that quite a few offenders manage to commit crimes without getting caught in the act, often leaving them with a considerable amount of money or possessions. Once in a while some of them do get arrested, but regarding the insignificant penalties and the Norwegian prisons reminding more of hotels than of convent institutions, it is likely to get the impression that from an economic point of view crime does pay after all. However, in this matter there are other aspects to be considered than just the possible economic profit.
In many ways the offenders exclude themselves from society by committing crimes, in the sense that they do not adopt the common norms and rules that is required to be a part of the community. They are on the contrary unwanted elements that society spends a great amount of time and effort to eliminate. Even though many criminals probably have their own, little communities consisting of other people of their kind, the lack of feeling included from the society as a whole is a burden, and the prize these people have to pay.
The avoidance of the rejection mentioned above is only to be achieved by the criminals by concealing their affairs. The evident risk of being caught is always present, creating stress in the matter that the law-breakers always have to be on their guard. A direct consequence is that they make it difficult for themselves to relax, especially in the presence of other people unaware of their occupation. Criminals are thus to a high extent prevented from developing close relationships with common, law-abiding people.
People committing crimes often have a perspective on both their fellow men as well as on values and morals that somewhat differs from the rest of the community. Criminals become victims of materialism, sacrificing their moral qualities for material cravings. Their constantly fading sense of conscience makes them capable of acting ignorant towards other people; the real victims. These are the people whose lives are deeply influenced by the crimes committed, whether they are the family of the offender or more important - the people violated or offended by the action. By depriving themselves of the quality of being able to have empathy with other people, the criminals mark the most basic difference between themselves and desent people.
The ironic fact is that if a criminal later in life should want to start an honest life after being imprisoned, he or she is depending on the exact same empathy from others to be able to get either a place to live or a job. The disfavour people hold against criminals is difficult to discard, and is often still there even though a criminal claims to be rehabilitated.
On the whole there is nothing with crimes that pays, it is merely an exchange of values, where the person committing a crime obtains material possessions at the expence of his morals, his conscience and his freedom.

NOBE1020,3.0,3.0,,,,,Crime does not pay,"
It is a simple message: Crime does not pay. What is so hard to understand about it? The words are common. There are no metaphors or fancy imagery, no irony or implied meanings. It is a simple message. Still, every day thousands of new criminals have to learn it by way of experience. For some reason it seems impossible to tell someone that crime simply does not pay.
Of course, it could be argued that crime does occasionally pay. People get away with murder, robbery and shoplifting every day. Or do they? They might not be caught. They might not feel sorry for their actions. They might not even suffer the fear of being discovered. But they will, sooner or later, have to deal with it again: Remorse might show her face any day. Perhaps was the successful snatch what triggered a more serious crime, changed their lives and made them suffer.
And those who do get caught: How many of them really think it was worth it? Apart from the Hollywood train robber with his treasure hidden and the girl waiting - hardly anyone. A large portion of the punished criminals have trouble understanding what they have done. They tend to blame others for their crime, in order to escape the self-reproach. Grown people who cannot or will not take responsibility for their actions expect to get away with anything if they  can only blame the right persons for their mistakes.
It is strange that so many of the criminals blame parents, teachers and bad friends for their misery, while at the same time their siblings and fellow students have had no problems at all with the same parents, teachers and friends. It is strange how the poor, unemployed single-mother next door inspired one neighbour to struggle for his education and at the same time she become another neighbour's proof that the struggle is not worth it. But what if the inmates had no one to blame? What kind of person deliberately hurts another human being, for money? Who can admit to be such a person?
Another unpleasant thought, is the thought of the victims. 'Victim' is not a pleasant word, is it? Have you ever thought of how it feels to think of the ones who got their homes turned upside-down by burglars. Poor old ladies who have had their bones broken for a lousy 50 pounds. Six-year olds who have to walk seven kilometres to get to school, because people don't pay their taxes...
Yes, there are also innocent victims to tax evasions. In contrast to what seems to be the common belief, taxes are not intended to 'rob the rich'. They are intended to raise money for the welfare state. And if 'the rich' set higher priority to skiing in Chamonix than to the welfare system, the myth of the exploiting land-owner might come true once again.
Crime does not pay. It never does, no matter no smart you are, or how brilliant your plan is. Mothers can always tell when their children have been eating sweets before dinner. All criminals will eventually be forced to eat their vegetables and skip desert. One way or the other.

NOBE1027,4.0,,,,,,Most university degrees are theoretical and do not prepare students for the real world. They are therefore of very little value,"
While the number of young people going to university seems to be on the increase, there are only a limited number of students who actually undertake a vocational study while at university. In fact, the Faculties of Arts at universities across the world are probably among the largest in student numbers. Here, students come to study languages, religion, history, philosophy and other non-vocational subjects. These subjects are by and large exclusively theoretical, and a number of people take more then one subject on foundation level, while pondering what they will do next in the big, wide world.
To say that these degrees are of little value, is however a statement without much foundation in facts. Take for instance students at the department of English. While in their first year of studies, they will gain a number of skills in language and linguistics, e.g. phonetic transcription, sentence analysis and practical usage of English, both as a spoken and written language. These are skills that will be fundamental and of great importance if any of the students would want to pursue a future career in teaching. A good knowledge of English would also be useful in a number of careers, both nationally and internationally, as English is today seen as an international language.
It is also important to consider the full range of skills that students acquire while at university. For instance, students who have completed a program of study have shown that they are capable of undertaking projects of research and study, both independently and as part of a group. Only in order to pass a program of study, a person will have to have a certain level of self-discipline and initiative in order to structure their studies and learning progress.
They acquire skills in presentation, both written and orally, and they will also have gained a certain level of interpersonal skill. It is of course no secret that today's university life is much more than attending lectures and numerous hours spent in the quiet study areas. In order to attract new students, universities will promote their social activities as well as their academic courses
All of these skills are points that a future employer will take into consideration when former students apply for jobs, having left university. One should not, therefore, mainly focus on whether a theoretical degree is of much value or not. It is what one has gained out of the time at university as a whole that is important, not just which subject one passed ones exams in. And if all else fails, one will have gained knowledge enough to answer more or less important questions in Trivial Pursuit.

NOBU1004,2.5,2.0,,,,,Feminists have done more harm to the cause of women than good,"
When we look up in a dictionary the word ""feminist"" is described like this: a person fighting for equal rights among men and women. More than hundred years ago women in Norway really had no rights at all. They couldn't claim education. The most important issue was to learn sewing and cooking in waiting for a marriage. When married she had no rights either. She was her husband's property. We must thank God for what the feminist have done for us women. Today we take for granted woman's position in society. A lot of strong women have fougth for their rights but they had a long way to go and they met opposition among men. In 1882 the first woman obtained Examen Artium and in 1884 women could enter university. Women won the right to vote in 1913 but they had to be aged 30 not 20 as the men.
To a great extent feminist have been a benefit for women. But when women enter the labour market they tend to get employed as social workes. So what has happened is that instead of being at home taking care of children and elder parents they prefer to get a job and doing the same work in a kindergarten or at a old people's home. The difference is that they get paid and get sosialized. A man and a woman working e.g. in a kindergarten have equal pay, but because it's a typical woman profession the salary is lower than for example in the industry. Three years at college doesn't pay! At least women have got economical freedom, gained self-respect and are not dependent on any man. The last tendency is that young girls chose other education, they want to have a decent salary and not physically hard work. Who are going to do the social work? In the long run we have to import workers from foreign countries.
In recent years it has struck me that feminist have done some harm to their own sex. The hours spent with family and children are less. Bad conscience about work and children are
something many working women have to live with. I think that men and woman are not biologically equal. Women are born to take care of their children and men to go out and hunt.. No feminist can do anything about it. When parents come tired home from work there are still working hours left in the house. Of course many men do their share but statistically the woman do most of this job at home. Why? Are men lazy and women not angry enough?
Feminist have done us a disservice. We have never been more tired and exhausted than today. Maybe the housemother should be more acknowledged and better paid to the good of the family as a whole. When mothers are working the children have to be taken care of by others. They have to stay at school from early in the evening to late in the afternoon. That is a very long ""working day"" for a little child! The husband is also exhausted because nowadays he also have to do his duties at home which in earlier days was done by the wife. The parents have both got an extended working day because washing, ironing, meals to be prepared must be done in the evening and in weekends.
Many women find this hard to balance and have found a compromise solution; they work part-time. Women who can afford this when their children are small are usually very satisfied. They are able to spend much time with their little ones and fulfil themselves in a job, used their skill and meet other adults. Few mothers are at home nowadays so one can feel rather lonely working at home all the day. The streets are empty and no children are out playing. Most of them are in kindergarten and when they come home they are too tired to go out. The family has suffered as a cause of feminism and the divorce rate has increased. Today it's difficult to be a family in balance where everybody claim their rights.

NOHB1001,3.0,3.0,,,,,"Some people say that in our modern world, dominated by science and technology and industrialisation, there is no longer a place for dreaming and imagination. What is your opinion?","
In the question about the place for imagination and dreaming in a modern world of science technology and industrialisation, my first response would have to be that they sure would have to have a place. But I can also see why some people say that there is no need for dreaming and imagination any more. One of the reasons may be that since the world now is full of modern technology, the use of dreaming and imagination is no longer needed. These days one can get all the help one needs through technology, and the workload in many places is lifted because of the technology and industrialisation which are developed during the last century. That has made the everyday hassle much easier for most people. I think, however, that even though all this new technology has made life easier for us who are living at present, we have to have the opportunity to be able to dream our way away from our everyday life.
I think that the ones, who are able to just sit somewhere daydreaming, have a very special gift. One can get the feeling that today's society is very much based on the people not using their imagination and dreams, considering the fact that we lead a stressful life style, with things happening almost every second of each day. And the only time we do not run around, is when we are sleeping. No wonder people of today have not got the time to dream. That is one of the reasons why I admire the people who are able to take a break from the stress of today, and just relax and enjoy themselves with their dreams and imaginations.
But when you think about it, we should all have had better time to dream, since the technology have lifted the workload off things, and thus made life easier for us. But instead of having more free time, many people have found other things to do, so that they still have very much to do all day. And by having so much to do, they do not have time to daydream any more.
I have experienced once, that children of today are not used to use their imagination very much. They watch a lot of television, and have less opportunity to think for themselves. I once said to some children I looked after that they ought to go outside and play instead of sitting inside watching television all day and they said to me that they did not know what to do. They did not know what to play, and I had to make suggestions for them. That scared me a bit. And I could not stop thinking about what all the technology have done to the children. They are getting too used to getting information from the radio and the television, and thus they use their own imagination less than I have the feeling they did, say 15-20 years ago.
So even though most of the technology is good for us, I think that there should definitely be a place for dreams and imagination in our everyday lives.

For centuries and centuries groups of people have been oppressed because of their religion, sex, cultural background and so on. This is mainly because of other extremely powerful people who can do whatever she or he pleases even though it means death and poverty for those not so fortunate.
In today's modern society we live after the principe that all men are equal."" This means that spite ones religion, way of life, sex, looks, colour of skin, one should all be treated the same way, in all branches of society. And one should respect one another for the differences and not criticise each other because of them.
Most of us would like to believe that that's the way things work in our western community, and that all sorts of discrimination only takes place in other parts of the world. This is true, to some extent. People in the third world and in countries stricken by war and poverty are more oppressed by those in power than those who are oppressed in our part of the world. But still there are people in our part of the world that also suffers . Added to the groups I already mentioned I am going to mention drug addicts, unemployed, those who suffer from different diseases without getting any medical help and so on. For people like this it is difficult to be treated like equals compared with those without trouble's like this, especially those with a great deal of money.
Those who for example are famous or extremely rich get special treatment and more attention than those that are not. Even though the same incident might occur for them-that is not equality
The politicians all say that all men are equal. But do the drugaddicts and the unemployed get the same treatment as the ones with money in the bank? All the goods is not for those who really need it but for those who already have everything they could ask for. And is it equality the way all the money in the world is distributed to the masses? People die on the streets from cold and hunger, without getting a share of it, while others get millions a week for playing football. I do not think that is equality.
I also think education comes in here. A good education costs money. And those who does not have a lot of money will sit with dept up their ears for years and years after. Some might ""skip"" a higher education just because of their poverty.
So to the question of how true the statement ""All men are equal: but some are more equal than others"" is. What the society wants is that all shall be equal. But if you ask me this will never happen. I think some men always will be more equal than others, in one way or the other. Because some will always have more power than others, and some will always have more money than others, and after my opinion this is what makes the statement true.

NOHO1001,3.5,2.5,,,,,Most university degrees are theoretical and do not prepare students for the real world. They are therefore of very little value,"
At Oslo College we have had many different subjects during four years of study. In these subjects there have been many differences in how much we have learned about how to teach. In some subjects we have not learned anything about teaching methods, which should be very important for us.
During our education we have had several weeks of practice in compulsory schools, but I am not sure if this will make me a better teacher. We are usually four students together in the same class with the same teacher. Most of the time everybody is inside the classroom when we are teaching. This is a very awkward situation since you normally are by yourself and do not have anybody to help you. In this particular practise- situation you are able to give the pupils a lot of help, because we are five grown-ups inside the classroom. This makes the whole situation very unrealistic.
Another aspect is that normally the teachers chosen for this kind of job, have few problems with their pupils. Everything I have experienced is that the pupils are very well behaved. I have not had the opportunity to solve a huge problem, which I probably will meet as a teacher. So generally, I think the practice is too unrealistic.
But of course, we do learn a lot of being out in school as well. We do get to see how it actually is. You get an idea whether you suit as a teacher or not, and you can also get an idea about which age group you would like to teach. It is a long time since we were at a compulsory school as pupils. Therefore we can get to see the school in a different perspective. Even though, we probably do not see how it actually will turn out for us, we do get a pretty good idea about how it is to be a teacher. The workload, what kind of problems they have to put up with, everything they have to do apart from teaching etc.
Apart from our practice, I have already mentioned that there are differences between the different subjects at our college. Why I do not know, but I do find is as a problem. In my point of view we have to learn the basic in the most common subjects as Norwegian for instance. In those subjects we choose as main subjects we should know much more than the basics.
I have chosen English and Physical Education as my main subjects and in both of these subjects we learn a lot about teaching methods. Physical Education is especially good concerning teaching methods, because we actually have a lot of practise within the group.
Some of the subjects I have had before have not been that good. One example is Norwegian where we did not learn anything about how to teach, but a lot of theoretic stuff.
Another aspect about our subjects is that our exams are very often not related to teaching methods. Only in Physical Education we do have a practice exam where we are suppose to teach other students. It would have been much more realistic if we actually had to teach pupils.
Because of the theoretic exams, we are very concerned about learning the theoretic stuff. We are less concerned about learning the teaching methods, because we want be asked for it at an exam. Or actually, we have had questions about how to teach at some written exams, but nobody feels that this is the most important part of the exam. Usually, it is a quite small part. The teachers are also concerned about that we are going to learn the theoretic aspects before the exams. This is probably the reason we do not have more teaching methods inside our courses.
My opinion is that this is too bad, but I also think it is the reality. Because of this our college degree can be too theoretical. Our exam-results do not say much about how good we are in teaching, but it is also important to have a wide range of knowledge in the subjects you are suppose to teach. So I would say, our college degrees are valuable, but they do not say everything about our knowledge in teaching.

The only college education I`ve ever done is the one I`m doing here at the teacher training college at the moment, so I have nothing to compare this statement with. But using my own college education as a starting point I`m not quite sure if I agree totally. Our education is special in that way that during these four years we have seventeen weeks of teacher training practice at different levels at the schools in Oslo and the area nearby. These weeks have taught me more then anything else during my education. And here you get a good idea about what your everyday life as a teacher could be like. So, I would have to say that this really prepares you for the real world. Then again, there is of course a debate about how real the teaching practice situation is. When you give a lecture you have three or four fellow students and your practice teacher present as well. This is of course not an ideal situation, and for some aspects very far from what you experience when you start working out in schools, but I felt that teaching practice gave me a good impression of what the ""real world"" would be like for a teacher anyway.
There is a fact though, that most of the college education, both for us, and even other college graduates, is theoretical. This is done to build up a certain platform of basic knowledge for everybody that takes this kind of education. For teachers I feel that it is important to have some general knowledge about most of the subjects that are being taught in school. But you are by no means done when you graduate from the college. Then you are only finished with a small part of your learning process as a teacher. A lot of the information you have to gain after that is also theoretical, and in this way our college prepares us for the ""real world"", by showing us where, and the methods to find more information.
IT is also starting to play a very significant role in everyday life, and especially in schools and for teachers. I feel that our education, although I guess this would depend on the courses you attend, gives us some very valuable experiences in this field, by integrating the use of the computer to that extent as it does.
Much of the education here at the teacher training college is also based on co-operation between students. My impression of a teacher`s day, is that a lot of it consists of working in teams, and work together with other people. This would also be preparation for the ""real world"". But the problem as I see it, is that at our college group-work is emphasised so much that it actually ""kills"" some of the strengths in the individuality which you also would have to depend upon out there in the ""real world"".
There is a lot that could be said about our education at the teacher training college here in Oslo, but I do not feel, as I`ve tried to argue for now, that our college degree is so theoretical that it is of very little value. I feel that our education have problems and could perhaps have been different, but this is by far not the biggest one.

NOHO1003,2.5,2.5,,,,,Most university degrees are theoretical and do not prepare students for the real world. They are therefore of very little value,"
I am a student at Oslo College, where I am attending my fourth year at the Teacher College. My class has agreed on writing an essay about this topic.
The first thing I would like to point out is that there are a great number of college degrees to choose from, and they vary a great deal in content, purpose, length, and intensity. At Oslo College, there are several different degrees, and other colleges' offers even other degrees.
Since I don't know very much about other colleges or other degrees, I will in this essay focus on my degree.
During four years at Teacher College, you each year spend some time in a compulsory school, to see how life in the classroom is. You are supposed to give lessons, plan them, argue for your didactic preparations, and why you chose the methods you used. The first year, this is done also to give the students a chance to see if they are fit to be in front of children, and if this is something they would enjoy doing. The two following years, the practise period the students take over the teaching responsibilities, and are to participate in all the work the teacher of the class has.
In most of the different subjects we take at the college, didactics is infiltrated in the teaching, and as we learn, we are also shown how to use what we learn in a classroom situation. We are given points on how to plan and go through with a lesson, and most subjects really does this well. Some, of course, better than others.
In this sense, the education at teacher college prepares us for the real life we will meet as we start to work as teachers. We have experienced what life is like in schools, we have been in different classes in different areas, and in various parts of the Oslo region. By this we have seen the multiplicity and variety that will meet us when we enter real life.
By this, I have defined real life as to what meets us after we finish our degree. I think that is given as we decide to take a degree, we also intend to use it. Almost everyone who takes a degree or other forms of higher education, does so with the intention of using it for work in some way. The teacher college is probably ""better"" at preparing us for real life than more theoretical degrees, as part of our education includes contact with other people besides our fellow students. However, all degrees are supposed to prepare you for future work, and in that way, they all prepare you for real life. Some educations are strictly theoretical, but that is because the job they are intended for, are theoretical.
There is always a purpose of a college degree, and if it prepares you for the work you intend to use it for, than it has prepared you for the real world.
I know that there have been changes in time regarding the content of various degrees, and the purpose of them. But these days to get the job you want, it often requires specialising in a narrow field. People take more and more education, and in the fierced competition, you must be very good at your narrow field to be excepted.

NOHO1004,3.0,2.5,,,,,Most university degrees are theoretical and do not prepare students for the real world. They are therefore of very little value,"
I can only answer this topic by taking examples from my own college education: Teacher training. I feel that I can't say anything for certain about other degrees, just what I've heard from others and know through media.
The Norwegian teacher training education is a four years study. During these four years we have compulsory subjects as Norwegian, Maths, Religion, Science and history and Education. In addition we can choose between more practical subjects like Arts and crafts, home economics or music, or choose to continue on the compulsory subjects.
During these four years we have a total of seventeen weeks of supervised teaching in a school.
The main problem about the Norwegian teacher training education is that everybody who attends it is supposed to be prepared for teaching children from the age of six through to the age of sixteen! There's almost no room for specialising for a particular year or subject.
When you take in to account that we are supposed to be teachers, we have very little methods for use in school. Most subjects tend to have a major theoretical part, but seem to forget that we need a basis for our later work in ""the real world"".
I don't say we don't need the theoretical part, on the contrary! We all need to have a certain level of knowledge to manage to filter out what's important to teach and not. You also need to see the overall lines, in other words see how facts or subjects often hang together. But not when you end up with theory only!
Even in an important subject as Education it seems like the course holders are out of touch with reality. They present theories upon theories about how it's supposed to be, but when you start working, or have teaching practise, you soon realize that it not like that at all, or maybe for just a few. It's also frightening when you learn that some of the course leaders haven't actually worked in a school for several years, or they haven't worked in a school at all.
Most students think that each subject, and especially Education, should put more emphasis on how to deal with problems you face in today's schools. You can't expect to teach children when they're swamped with problems both in school and at home. Sure, you have learnt about the theories, but what do you do when they don't apply? Things like conflict solving for example is just one of the areas we don't touch during our education, but you have to use it every day when you start working.
To summarise I would say that I agree with what the topic says to a certain degree. Our education uses too much time on theory and to little time on things we feel we need when we have to face to real world. For instance is seventeen weeks of practise not enough. We should at least have half a year or maybe even a whole year to really obtain the right insight to the occupation and it's problems. As I mentioned earlier you always need a basis of theory to manage whatever degree or occupation you train for. What you make out of the theory basis is up to each student to decide.

NOHO1011,3.0,3.5,,,,,Most university degrees are theoretical and do not prepare students for the real world. They are therefore of very little value,"
To discuss this statement, I would have to define the meaning. There are a lot of different college degrees, and if they are too theoretical or not, varies a lot. I would like to discuss the college degree that I have most knowledge about, the teacher degree at ""Hgskolen i"" Oslo.
During a four-year period, we are out teaching in classes 15 weeks. The last year we have no practice at all. From this it doesn't sound like it prepare the students for the real world. Compared with the students studying to be nurses, they have 2 months of practice every year, I believe. But anyway, the way the practice period for the students studying to be teachers is made, it is not like the real world. We are four or five students with one working teacher and in the same class. So for every lesson we have with the class, we are five or six adults in the classroom. That would have been wonderful when we're educated teachers. But the truth is that is never going to happen in the real world, unless we decide to have students in practice. Since the situation from practice is not at all like the situation we're going to have when we're educated teachers, I think they should have changed it. Just the fact that it is only 15 weeks during a four-year period should be changed.
The subjects in the teaching degree are relevant for the real world. The question is if they are too theoretical. Some of the subjects definitely are. Let's have a closer look at Norwegian for example. It is a very interesting subject, and the teachers are really good. I would say they are some of the best at this school, but the themes we look at during the year, have nothing with what we are to face in school after we have become teachers. The Norwegian subject for instance lack the subject on how to learn children to read, which is a very important theme for new teachers with no experience.
The course in Norwegian has the same level as the University in Oslo, and that is great. The problem is that the course doesn't relate any subject to the fact that all the students taking the course will teach Norwegian in primary schools. So for the statement in the title, I would say that the course in Norwegian is too theoretical.
The English course here at the same college, is maybe to practical. The reason is that everything is related to the fact that the students will be teaching English in primary schools. Everything is taught with the same methods you could expect in primary schools, but we're at a higher level, though sometimes it you couldn't tell the difference. In a way it does prepare us for the real world, but I mean you could combine what the Norwegian course does and the English course does, not too theoretical and not too practical. But all in all, I would have to say that the college degree I take is too theoretical, but its not of very little value. It does prepare us for the real world. But of course if it was more practical it would be better.

NOHO1013,2.5,3.5,,,,,Most university degrees are theoretical and do not prepare students for the real world. They are therefore of very little value,"
In the following I will try to discuss the above statement. I will do this by putting emphasis on the college degree I know the most about, the teacher education.
Most College degrees are in need of both a theoretical and a practical side. In the today's society the technology has, in many ways, taken over, and to keep up with the development you need a theoretical background in most occupations. Although the theoretical background might be important, you can not underestimate the fact that many college degrees also need a practical side. In these cases the practical side of the education might be well as important as the theoretical side. In occupations like nurse, police officer and teacher you definitely need more that the theoretical part the education provides to function well.
In these studies among others, you have a practice period during your study time. I find it limited what you are able to learn during a couple of weeks a year. There is simply not enough time to learn everything, which is important to know before you start working. The whole practical situation is very artificial, and does not prepare the students for the real world. You are constantly watched by someone professional, and are told what to do in every situation. This does not bring out the best in people, and the whole situation limits what you can learn from your own mistakes.
On the other hand you, as a student, need supervised practise. In many cases you are in charge of a lot of people, and you can not afford to make a mistake. When you are to work with people you are in need of a background which is more that just theoretical. You need to know how to act in different situations, and this is something you can not learn from books. In many cases it would have been better for the students if the Colleges could have tried to make the theoretical and practical parts more of the same standing. I feel that although I take a practical degree the lack of practical topics are severe.
What I miss the most in my education is the practical advice, which might help me through my first year of teaching. I know that many of the teachers at the College mean that they do not have the time to teach us these things. Nevertheless it would have been of great help to get some good advice from someone who has been in the same situation, and knows about the difference between being a student and a teacher. I am afraid that if the college do not start putting emphasis on this, many students might find it too hard to handle the everyday situations as a teacher. This might end in the teachers using their education some where else than in school.
It is hard to state what needs to be done with the situation, but I know for a fact that if something is not done it will become harder to recruit people to the practical college degrees in the future.

NOHO1018,3.5,3.5,,,,,Most university degrees are theoretical and do not prepare students for the real world. They are therefore of very little value,"
Although there would have to be different views regarding this issue, I think it is necessary to say that it is an important question, which politicians and universities should keep in mind and evaluate as often as possible too ensure a best possible education for the students. I also think the question is too extensive to simply answer yes or no. Some university degrees would naturally have to be more theoretical than other degrees, depending to which type of occupation they prepare the students. Each university degree should therefore be lead by competent people with work experience, who know which skills are required in the real world and who have ideas of how the balance between theory and practise should be. However, this may not be as easy as one would think. The society today changes so quickly, that a person with a lot of experience from a long career may not have the right knowledge or skills to pass on to the students, or may not know which skills the students will need in the future. The universities and politicians have a difficult job deciding what to teach the students, and must therefore be prepared to receive critics, like the statement claiming that most university degrees are too theoretical.
I think it is important to look at this statement in connection with the opportunities for getting work and education today. Traditionally, all types of education have been quite theoretical and I would think this is the situation for a lot of university degrees also today. Earlier it was people who succeeded in school that went on with further education. And an academic education with a lot of theory has traditionally had a bigger status than a more practical one. Today almost all kinds of jobs require some kind of education, and I believe people react when you previously could get a job without any education which now suddenly requires an education with quite a lot of theory.
However, I think there are more sides to be considered. Most young people in Norway today study for many years, and it is a trend to study the subjects you like, not considering which occupation you want to get. ""The jobs are there for you anyway"" seems to me to be a common attitude, and young people are not in a hurry to get a job. I would therefore think that they would be satisfied with a study based on theory since practise would be regarded as irrelevant, without an occupation in mind as the aim for the practise.
However, there are still many university degrees that do prepare students for a certain occupation, and to get the right quantity and quality of both the practise and theory would be necessary to make the education meaningful for the students. I believe it is these university degrees that mostly get the criticism of being too theoretical. The students may feel they learn more in practise than learning theory at the university.
When I first started on my teacher training, I had high expectations to the standard of the training. However I was soon disappointed. T o me it seemed like some of the teachers had never been teaching school children, and I felt the training was poorly organised. In accordance with the course plan, each subject should contain a method part with a lot of practical ideas, but I strongly felt that this part was ignored in most subjects. But although I feel that the teacher training should contain more methods and practise, I also think it important to know your subject well as a teacher. To be able to help the pupils professionally the teacher should have some more knowledge than the pupil.
I do think some university degrees should be more practical than other degrees and some university degrees should include more practical teaching. But I do not think it is right to say that makes it an education with little value. Practise is something you get throughout your whole career, and should not replace the theory. I believe it would be a good idea to get professional guidance or help when you start your career in addition to the practise you get at the universities, but this seems difficult to realise. While some students cry out for more practical teaching, other students may study only subjects and not doing or learning anything practical at all. Maybe this can be an important issue to bring into the discussion about the quality and quantity of the different university degrees.

NOHO1019,3.5,2.5,2.5,3.5,3.5,4.0,Most university degrees are theoretical and do not prepare students for the real world. They are therefore of very little value,"
This statement does probably make sense to very many people. However, I find it important to focus on the necessity of theoretical knowledge. I would like to separate this essay into two parts; to what extend is theory in general necesarry, and where and how does practice take part in the university degree.
I myself do not have a university degree, but I have done the first year of law studies at the University of Oslo. This gave me some experience on how university degrees can be very theoretical and is therefore mainly what I base my writing on. No matter what you hope or plan to work with in the future, theoretical knowledge is important. It is important both to your own self asteem as well as to the fundamental theory needed in very many jobs. How can one be prepared for the real world without this fundament. When you first decide to be educated at a university, I think it is because you want to learn something thoroughly. This is something that takes time and demands a lot of reading and studying. But when you really want to learn something, I do believe it is all worth it.
When this is said, it is clear that a practical part of a university degree has some importance. As a law student you go through your education of at least five and a half years without any time of practice. To many this is the only way and they do not think of practice as a option. However, I remember thinking how much more interesting things could have been, and also how much easier to understand with some time to practice the theory one is learning. Those who deal with legal questions in the daily life do not often do this alone behind closed doors. They have to communicate and deal with all sorts of people, and this is not something you can learn only by reading. It is possible that future lawyers and other legal advisers could be better equipped with some time of practice during their studies. And this goes for many other working groups as well. If you go to the university to prepare to be a teacher, practical learning is very important. I would go as far as to say it is essential, and I do not think this has to be explained. As a teacher communication is probably the most important ""tool"" you can have at hand. It does not matter how much theoretical knowledge you have, if the practical one does not exsist. (To a techer to be, practice is obligatory at the university. This is just an example). At the same time, I am well aware of how theory is a necessity. A good mix of theory and practice would be the golden mean. But then again, how is this ""mix"" to be decided.
It is impossible to generalize when it comes to the importance of practical learning in a university degree. Very often this will depend on the subject or field one is focusing on. However, the statement at the beginning of this essay is not something I agree with. It would be one thing to say that some university degrees tend to be too theoretical. To say that they are of vey little value is a bit too much. As I have said earlier, I believe that preparartion for the real world is important. At the same time this also applies for ""the theoretical world"". I do not think it is possible to have a good education without parts from both ""worlds"" implied. The clue would be to find out how this could be arranged in the different university degrees. This is something I do not intend to look further into here. The matter is difficult and needs developing and discussion on a whole other level.

Imagine you are a young boy or girl around fifteen or sixteen years old. Your watch shows 01.30.am and you are about to commit a burglary. This is a situation that may change your life forever but you are not thinking of the consequences at this moment, the excitement drives you. You are lucky this time and you get away with it. What about next time when you are not so lucky? You have now entered a new society; you have become a criminal. Once you have crossed that line and chose not to live by the rules set in your community, your everyday life is about to change. Whether you have to serve time or do community service it will still go on your criminal record. And that is not something you would want to put next to your job application. For some reason employers do not favour applicants with a record. Of course it is possible to change and everyone deserves a second chance, but it is a fact that most people would find it hard to trust a person with a criminal record no matter if the crime was committed ten years ago. Your past will haunt you there is just no escaping from it. There are not any advantages combined with crime, it will only cause you trouble. Frustration in search of a job and constant fear of being rejected. And when you do get a job there will always be these suspicious looks and people judging you for what you have done. It does not matter if you believe you have changed and are able to start a new life there will always be someone or something to remind you of your past. If you are once branded a criminal it is hard to erase that opinion of you from peoples minds. They see you as a burden to society and not an equal member.
It is not hard to see that crime does not pay. Your criminal behaviour will cause another person pain whether it is something you have stolen from a private person, a firm or you have hurt someone physically, either way there is bound to be somebody hurting. And for those involuntarily involved there probably are not any excuses good enough. Not only does crime affect innocent people; it also turns your own life upside down. Once you have broken the law the chances for doing it again increases. You get in deeper each time and make it harder for you to start a new life. If you become a part of the prison system it will eventually seem like a home to you. Being surrounded by other criminals with negative attitude will effect your mentality. It will lead to a self destructive way of thinking and that will get you nowhere, except to perhaps a different prison. It is important to be aware of the consequences that arise from a crime. There is a reason why laws were made with the intention of keeping the society together. There has to be a distinction between good and bad, a common view of what is right and wrong. If you obey the law and behave accordingly you will be excepted as a part of it. If you do not you pay.

NOHO1023,3.5,3.5,,,,,"Some people say that in our modern world, dominated by science and technology and industrialisation, there is no longer a place for dreaming and imagination. What is your opinion?","
Some people might say that in our modern world, dominated by science technology and industrialisation, there is no longer a place for dreaming and imagination. I could not have disagreed more to such a statement. To try to prove that people who actually believe this are wrong, I am going to give you some examples of things or ""happenings"" which I believe proofs that there is place for dreaming and imagination in our modern world.
One example to prove ""them"" to be wrong is the popularity of fiction books, both for children and adults. Some good examples here are the book ""The Lord Of The Rings"" and the books about ""Harry Potter"". Of course books with less ingredients from the magical world, are popular as well. The most important part is that they represent something fictional. By this I mean that the books can be so close up to the real world, or they can contain elements which make us understand that this would be unlikely to happen in ""real life"".
Most of us human beings like to read books, because through the stories told in the books we can escape from the real world. We are able to literary walk into an imaginary one and stay here as long as we want to. And often we feel a strong identification with what the main character is going through or experience. We also tend to make up our own scenes, how we believe each scene in the book would be if it was filmed. In other words we make our own ""film"" of the book, and we imagine how each character is suppose to look like. At least that is what I often experience when I read well written books.
Another examples is that we tend to watch films or movies just for entertainment bit. I dear to say that it depends on your mood what kind of film/video you choose to see. If you are sad or a little bit depressed, you would probably choose a comedian film/video or at least a film/video which would make you laugh and forget about your problems for a little while.
Or if you have just been dumped by your boy/girlfriend, you would probably not choose a romantic film/video. Simply because you would then be reminded of your new status; you being single and alone. Or if you are dreaming about having a boy/girlfriend, you would probably prefer to watch a romantic film/video. Because by watching this type of film/video you might ""re-believe"" the fact that there is such a beautiful thing as true love.
It is in fact the same thing with films/videos as with books, we tend to use them as a port to an imaginary world. We can escape from the real world and be in a dream world where everything can happen.
A third example is the fact that there are dozen people who uses their imagination and their inner (and often personal) dreams for a living. Such as artists within the different genre of art, for instance painting artists or craftsman designers, poets and musicians within the different categories of the world of music(pop, rock, jazz, etc.). And these people have an audience who are willing to pay to see, read about or hear their dreams and inner thoughts.
Another example is that science technology have made it possible to fulfil different types of dreams. For instance the opportunity to do cosmetic operations. Many people are dreaming about being able to improve their looks. Or what about the first time in history when the first human being was walking on the moon. For some people that is their biggest dream. There are of course several other things that have been possible to do because of the improvement within science technology and industrialisation, but it would be too comprehensive to go further into these things in this essay.
One of the good things of being a human being is that we have the possibility to put word on what we desire, what we wish for, and what we are dreaming about. And that distinguish us from other creatures. Either we are daydreaming or dreaming while we sleep, our dreams give expression to a great amount of imagination. We are able to use our imagination, and to express to others what we are dreaming about.
Hopefully I have been able to express my opinion through the examples mentioned above. I truly believe that there is and always will be a place for dreaming and imagination in our modern world. We are ""made"" to do that.

NOHO1024,1.5,2.0,,,,,Feminists have done more harm to the cause of women than good,"
Have feminists done more harm to the cause of women than good? That really depends on what is defined as the cause of women. Obviously fighting for and eventually gaining the right to vote was a major step forward for suffragettes all over the world. Fighting for equal pay is also a natural thing to do. Things as basic as these can be seen as matters-of-course, and the main problems with the whole women's liberation movement today are quite different. Take for example the ever-returning discussion regarding what certain women feel as the objectification of women. Sexual objectification, that is. Every Christmas at about the same time Hennes & Mauritz has huge billboards all over the country depicting some very nice looking woman wearing affordable clothes. And every year there's the same discussion whether this is fine or an insult to every living woman. Now, what the hell is the problem? Fact one: Sex sells! Fact two: Men will always enjoy looking at pictures of beautiful women. If something is popular you'll have a hell of a hard time convincing the rest of the world that it's poor taste. Yes, most men see the woman on these posters as a sex object. What can you expect? It's a photograph, it's not as if you can have a meaningful conversation with her. When, from time to time, there's a man in his underwear on these billboards are men screaming about what a low self-esteem this is causing them? I think feminists who are so upset by this are missing the point. It's all a matter of context.
Another area where I think women's lib has gone astray is work vs. Taking care of children. I am neither a Christian conservative or a member of the Taliban, but I think some women try their best to ignore the scientific fact that, during certain periods of early childhood, the mother is the main key figure in a child's life. Otto Jespersen did a fantastic parody of a career woman who was also a mother to a young boy. So many women feel the need, or some kind of pressure, to have a successful career even if they have small children, pressure which can be traced back to the whole women's lib movement. Why on Earth shouldn't the raising of children be regarded equally important as some pathetic career in an advertising agency, selling detergent. This, I think, comes from all the talk about realising oneself and one's dreams. Granted, I think doing something that you like or have always dreamed of doing is important, it's just that you can't do that and raise small children at the same time. Roger Kurland's brilliant Lekestue deals with this issue by looking at a care-by-pay scenario, the day care center. How can anyone expect that, for a certain amount of money, someone else will take care of and love a child better than the mother?  If I were a mother, I would not pay someone to look after them!

He was probably looking forward to a juicy discussion, but I guess he asked the wrong person or maybe I could say he asked the wrong generation. The International Women's Day has occurred 32 times in my life but the thought of contributing in one way or another has never crossed my mind and I believe a lot of women in my age would say the same. Feminism is a non-existent topic but in the back of our minds we despise the feminists and call them names: Man-looking man-haters who threw their bras and forced abortion upon every woman.
On the other hand we take it for granted that our husbands cook, do the dishes and change diapers as much as we do. Are we ungrateful heiresses to what is gained throughout a century of ""war""? Or have feminists done more harm than good to the cause of women? My answers will not be based upon research but simply upon my own observations and thoughts being a mother and wife -and obviously a woman.
Please your husband, take care of your children, and accept whatever comes; these were your only instructions and rights a hundred years ago. I think most Norwegian women are happy that they live today. Some of my girl friends are film directors, shop owners, designers, dancers, newspaper reporters, top athletes, musicians and doctors. Some are single mothers and own their own apartment. We have conquered every stage of society; the world is at our feet.
But the discontent always speaks out loud. Enough is never enough and it might seem pathetic that some feminists still are so extremely angry -because women aren't represented 50% in the best paid jobs, quota above qualification. I am sure I could point at several bad things that took place in the name of feminism. But this is where I think the feminist warriors have lost their way: in their eagerness to achieve equality they ignored to define what feminism truly is as a starting point.
We cannot deny the fact that we are women; nothing can change that (except an operation of course). Have we lost our feminine character? Oh, we are so fit and good looking and anorectic and dress like hookers but in an expensive way so as not to be mistaken for one, but do we feel female? Are we too hooked up in the money race that we don't recognise our own gender? We give birth to kids that we put in kindergarten, have full time jobs (or even more because carrier demands it) and someone (a woman?) to wash our big houses.
What are the female characteristics -things that men don't have? We do not dare to ask our men. That would be very degrading to admit our lack of knowledge and a huge step backwards. Why do ""they"" find the South European women so attractive? The modern super model carrier woman doesn't need a man except as a sex partner. She wants children but success is more important. She sees her children 30 tired hours a week while more than 40 hours a week she gives all her energy to the job. Making other priorities is a total failure.
We've become like our men, but as a result of this our men have become like us. Why do ""we"" find South European men so attractive? While we eagerly have struggled for our quotas, the enemy has become wife-ridden and henpecked. What a misunderstanding of female integrity!
However, a glimpse of a burka-wearing person in Yemen is enough to conclude that we are quite lucky to live in this ""androgyny"" society. Feminism has certainly contributed in making our world cynical and selfish, but in order to create change and revolution things needed to be stirred up, provoked and brought to the extreme edges.
The eighth of March is only one week from now. I won't be joining the demonstrators this year either.

NOHO1027,3.0,2.0,,,,,Crime does not pay,"
One day you think to yourself ""I have no money, but I do not want to sit at home today. Perhaps I will take a trip down town"". You sneak onto the train, where there is no ticket control, and you get away with it. You remember that you forgot to brush your teeth after breakfast so you go into a supermarket to buy one. But then you remember that you have no money, what are you to do? You go and put the gum in your pocket, no one sees you. You walk out of the store, and you get away with it. Once you are in the city you realise that there is not much to do if you do not have any money. The day is cold and you are getting cold. You walk towards the tram station. And as you get closer you se an old lady looses her wallet. You look around and notice that people are to busy with themselves to see that you pick the wallet up and put it in your own pocket, and you get away with it.
All these actions are in themselves rather small crimes, but they affect people's lives in some way. The train tickets gets more expensive, because people do not pay. The trains carry the same amount of people but if 1/3 of these do not pay, it means that they do not get the money they are supposed to and can therefore not give the service to their customers, as they would like. Which leads to the fact that prices rises. Prises will also rise if people go stealing in shops. There will be increased security and you might actually feel like on of the characters in Big Brother, with cameras everywhere.
We have this imagination that if a crime is done someone will be caught and punished. Either with fines or do jail time, and hopefully be rehabilitated not to do it again. But sadly that is not always the case, as we have seen to many times now.
Another thing is that once a criminal is caught the legal system fails. People who rape and child abusers, actually sometimes get off with less time in jail than a person who is caught smuggling drugs for his or her own use. Of course this last crime is severe enough, but I think it is necessary for the legal system to look through their five hundred years old laws so that people who commit a crime is punished after what the crime is, and that the laws a strict enough to prevent other people to walk that same lane.
It seems to me that at the moment crimes pay, if you get away with it. And this is a frightening thought. Frightening in the way that we do not know where we will end up if the society looses respect for other people and their property. Hopefully we can one day say that: ""Crime does not pay!""

Crime doesn't pay, or at least it doesn't for the people we read about in the papers. The ones who get caught once in a while, the ones who rob the 7-eleven twice a week, the same people who steal pocket money from their grandparents. Crime is much like any other business really, terribly unfair. Except for one major difference that is. We never hear much about the really good ones, the master criminals. Actually they would probably be insulted labelled criminals in the first place. You must remember that they are highly skilled at what they do. They would certainly love to brag about their cunning plans and their greatest adventures. But they can't do that. Of course they can't. They are never seen on the front pages around the world. The bags of money they steal might look just the same as any other money around, but I tell you it's not. They can't go out and spend it all away. It is infected money, and nobody knows this more than the master criminals themselves. Bringing the money out of that vault is only part of the job you see. Getting it back into the legitimate flow means more work. And then suddenly a totally different group of people enter the scene...
So who are these people then? I can't really tell you, because I've never met one myself. One might speculate however. It is easy to think of the professional burglar as sort of a James Bond type. A high profile and well-dressed gentleman. I'm afraid that this indeed not the truth. The successful criminal probably lives and looks just like any other legitimate businessman. He runs his own little company, wears his grey suit to work and even pays his taxes. Keeping a low profile might be the most important skill for a successful criminal. The really gifted ones know they can't be too careful. There's always someone out there watching, tracing back that money, searching through those accounts.
How about the moral aspect then. The poor addict who spends half his time a free man and the rest behind prison walls. Does he have problems falling to sleep at night because of bad conscience? Well, first you might ask yourself, should he really have to struggle with a question like that at all? Isn't he punished enough as it is? To be honest I believe it is too late to expect much deep thought from this sort of criminal. His worries lie with far greater problems than those concerning right or wrong. He would sell all his grandmother's furniture for all I know. For him it is no longer a question if crime pays off or not. In order to survive he has to do certain things. And if that means stealing your car, that's just what he'll do. As simple as that.
The other type, he who truly profits from stealing all that money, does he have his ten minutes of serious doubt every now and then? ""He should"", I hear you saying. He doesn't of course. And I can tell you are not overly surprised for me telling it to you. He might fear getting caught once a while, but that is not the same as regretting or even questioning his chosen occupation. This guy may use his wits a lot, but his thoughts are not exactly hung up on moral philosophy.
So does crime pay off then? Obviously not for those who get caught every time. For the rest it certainly appears it does. But one thing you definitely should remember before considering a new career in crime, most professional criminals put down more work in what they do than what most law-abiding citizens will ever do.

NOHO1032,3.0,,,,,,"Some people say that in our modern world, dominated by science and technology and industrialisation, there is no longer a place for dreaming and imagination. What is your opinion?","
Yesterday my boyfriend came home, screaming and jumping with joy. He came home with a huge box, containing his fancy brand new laptop computer.
In the 1980's ""nobody"" had their own computer. In the 1990's more and more people got their own computer, and now - in 2002 - literally everybody has their own. And a mobile phone. And internet access. And their own DVD player. And MasterCard. We get information and access faster and faster, into our own home almost without moving an inch. Everybody seems to embrace a sort of ""faster, better, MORE!"" mentality, as we spend more and more time and money on our computers and the new technology.
People have changed. From an innocent ""do-it-yourself"" mentality, people have now got a ""let-the-technology-do-it-for-you"" point of view. It is hard to say exactly when this changed, but my suggestion is that much of the innocence concerning the research connected with receiving information and communication technology died with the 80's. This is part of what is called the ""Second Industrial Revolution"". In families with children, often both the parents work, and they often have the money to buy their kids a computer and a cell phone as well. Kids aren't as much out as they used to be. No, they're playing ""Shoot to Kill"" on their PlayStation 2 (which they of course got from Dad for Christmas, who also likes to play occasionally). Is this good? Is it good that children who before had to activate themselves now are being activated by a computer? And what if everybody expects an easy, well-organised society where everything is set up for them, - somebody has to be the ""organisators"". (And who are they?)
Let's compare today with the ""old days"". How much better was the world? If you ask your parents they would probably say that ""I don't understand the technology, the world was safer, I don't really like the way it is today"" and so on. If only they knew. The world is actually depending on the growing technology. It creates new jobs and it is actually supposed to make the world better and easier to live in. The science technology offers new information for us to think about and dwell on, which again gives us more facts to base our reality on and this again offers us a basis to develop our imagination.
So in my opinion an industrialised society is not necessarily negative. Development is natural, changes are natural. Science can be brutal, but I think it is supposed to be. We are also supposed to be critical, as we have that ability as human beings (most people are afraid of new things). I think this ""conflict"" is less about what is new, but more about how to decide what you want to spend your time on. Both imagination, fantasy and information technology depend on creative people.
So is there still a place for dreaming and imagination? In my opinion: Yes. There is place for whatever there is time for, and just as we have to choose throughout our lives, we'll have to choose in this case as well. In my opinion, the question of if there is place enough for both science technology and imagination, I would say that the question is quite irrelevant. Of course there is place enough! Instead, we'll have to ask ourselves the question, ""What do we want to spend our time on?"" and so forth, and we will have to choose. There is brain enough in us for both information technology and dreaming/imagination. As I said I think the biggest problem is enough time. To explore all fields we need more time, and also time to relax in between so that our imagination gets the chance to develop.
Normally one would recognise dreaming and imagination as something good, but we must also remember that fantasy and dreaming not necessarily is something positive. For instance, children are often easily led and they often need their parents to help them focusing on the positive (""right"") aspects. The only problem is that with all the information we have, it is often hard to point out what is relevant.
In today's society we depend on something called ""communicative competence"", which is part of people's socialization, and this is acquired in many ways. We need communicative competence to use information technology, but most importantly we also need it to convey other aspects in our lives, like our imagination. Many grown ups tend to forget their imagination and fantasy, and this is not because of the science technology, but because they are grown ups and play a role in ""life's theatre"". Sadly, grown ups aren't ""meant to"" be childish. It's sad, because it prevents them from exploring their imagination more often.
And remember, even if every computer in the world exploded, if every server was gone in a bang, you'd still have your brain and you'd still have your imagination.

NOHO1033,3.0,,,,,,The prison system is outdated. No civilized society should punish its criminals: it should rehabilitate them,"
We are now in the year 2002 and have entered the 21st century. It is perhaps time to think new ways when we talk about sentences, but where shall we draw the line? Shall we continue having prisons? Who will come under the criteria for rehabilitation and who should get a prison sentence? Is our prison system so outdated that we should abolish today system and close down the prisons and rehabilitate our criminals in other institutions? Which criteria should those new institutions have if these not should be a new type of prison? We certainly can't have a holiday resort for criminals!
Should we start with home sentences? In Sweden they are testing home punishment. There is the convicted person marked on either hand or foot with a sensor, a public attendant comes around daily to check the sensor. The sensor records every movement the convicted person makes and will tell if she/het has been outside the restricted area. This will save society money and it makes life better for the convict. How it functions and if the politicians and the legal system are satisfied with this new way of prosecution is unknown for me. I haven't seen any article or documentary about an evaluation of this way of paying your crime.
Should someone who has committed a murder be allowed to have a nicer way of doing his time than sitting locked up in a prison as they do today? How would society feel if those two young men who committed the terrible rap and murder of two small girls in Kristiansand where rehabilitated into society without been imprisoned? We are not ready to not prosecute our criminals and not put them into prison. Finding a solution to rehabilitate them is a good thought, but those who are touched by the criminals action want to see them punished as hard as possible. Society still demands punishment for crimes committed. Especially crimes which includes children or murder, people will not except any milder form for punishment than a long prison sentence or in sever cases death penalty. (I think of countries who have death penalties, like for example America and China)
I don't think that we can discuss our legal system and criticise it from the point of view of being a civilised society. If we were such an incredible civilised society why do we have criminals and why do we need sanctions for behaviour we dislike?
I know that one reason of becoming a criminal lies in the way we treat our children when they are small. Alcohol and drugs, unemployment and other factors can have much to say which direction your life will take. There are many children today who need extra care, something they don't receive. Some teachers see their extra needs and try to apply for extra resources during their education, but many don't get the help because of lack of money.
Many children experience that being a looser is humiliating and being good in something gives a good reputation. Playing tough, getting hold of things which others don't have when you are young gives in the beginning a good reputation, it often ends in bad circle, which is difficult to get out of.
Even if our technology is good, people still get disabled children or children with brain damage. Some of these brain disorders are not found and can later in life occur in a lifestyle and behaviour which society not appreciates.
I don't think that we ever will have a society without anyone behaving against what we accept. Believing in something like that, will be a utopia.

NOHO1034,3.0,,,,,,The prison system is outdated. No civilized society should punish its criminals: it should rehabilitate them,"
In the period 1996 till 2000 24.255 pupils were charged with crimes. (Statistisk sentralbyr) 13.357 of them did crime again, said with other words: in that period 55 % of the criminals had relapse. When we look at the age of the criminals we can see that it is much easier for youngsters to get relapse. Among men between 15 and 17 years old 62 % had relapse, and among men between 40 and 59 years old 29 % had relapse. The most important thing is to rehabilitate youngsters. The circumstances in prisons are tough and there are a lot of drugs among the criminals. Some says that if you are not a criminal when you get into prison you nevertheless will end up as a criminal during your stay.
It is important for youngsters to have good role models, and when you only have company with other criminals there are lack of good models. Most of the young criminals have lack of self-esteem. The reason why they end up like criminals can bee several and difficult to recognise, but I am sure that many of them have had a bad childhood. Some of them have lived in families with alcohol problems, problems with drugs, criminals, abusing, incest or other psychological problems. Some have been bulled at school and in leisure or they have problems with their identity. Some are in need of exciting experience, they love to try out new things, like alcohol, drugs, stealing and extreme sports. Some are just unlucky and have company with wrong friends. There is one thing most of the young criminals have in common, and that is their problems with drugs. They start to smoke, they try out alcohol at the weekends and then they start to use different sort of drugs. Most of them start with hashish and end up with ecstasy or heroin. In the beginning they just need little hashish, and it is quite cheap, but after a while they need more and more drugs and now they will be in need of a lot of money. Then many of them have to do crimes to get enough money for drugs.
These youngsters are among other criminals in leisure and some of them have bad role models at home, they get into prison and there they also have company with other criminals. The result is that they do not know how to behave like ""normal"" human being. Very often young people look up to older people and try to act like them, and when they act like the older in prison they will continue as a criminal. Some says that a prison is like a school where they teach pupils to become criminals.
Some of the criminals are born and bred with punishment and there has been a lack of attention from their parents. For these children it is better with bad attention, like punishment, than no attention. Then they do bad things to get attention. In many prisons they use punishment as an effect, and isolation and control are often used as punishment. If you are delayed after a leave, you use drugs or you use violence among the others, they punish you for example with isolation at your room. I heard about a girl with psychological problems, who was imprisoned because of drug-crimes, and she had a fortnight left. She had a leave, came 2 hours delayed and the punishment was 14 days in isolation. After a fortnight in isolation she was supposed to be prepared for freedom outside...
This was one example, but I am sure there are lot of others. Prisons do not prepare people for a life in freedom. When the imprisoning is finished a lot of criminals are just standing outside the prison without a job and without good friends. It is very difficult to start a new law abiding life. Most of their ""friends"" are other criminals and they have a lack of self esteem, then it is easy to continue with crimes.
Every human being is in need of love, positive attention, respect and acknowledgement. Many criminals have lack of self esteem because they feel people just look at them as criminals, not as human beings with feelings and some positive points. Punishment in prison will not rehabilitate them for a life in freedom. They need love, positive attention and respect to be rehabilitated for a good life in freedom.

In this time, with all this ""smart solutions"", many people try to get maximum disbursement for minimum effort. This may, in some situations, lead to solutions which can be extremely untraditional, and in some cases, also illegal.
As time goes by it is easy to loose perspective on what is legal, and what is not. Crime does not pay is a statement which becomes the essential topic of the following discussion. Our judicial system is clear about this statement. Crime are not suppose to pay, but is it a fact?
If we look back at our Norse family saga we can se that they had a simple definition on what crime is. That is, doing wrong against people or society. What is wrong could be different from society to society.
People in all times have stuck together in minor groups. As time passes by the groups got bigger, and the need to have some kind of control became importunate. The most important job was to keep peace within the group, and to defend the group from intruders. To be able to do this, it was necessary to make laws and rules that everybody had to relate to. The first rules that were invented dealt with economic conditions. We know from the Norse family saga that all crimes can be paid of with economic means. As punishment you could also be sentenced to be an outlaw, or to be told to leave the country for a certain period of time. Crime against individuals was settled with the molested. Crime against the country/society was settled with the King.
As you can see of the history, people have committed as long as people have existed. After a while, the society had to protect themselves against a steady increasing criminality. The punishment is suppose to prevent these things from happening. Later this sight has changed. Nowadays the punishment is also meant to rehabilitate the punished.
An important principle in our judicial system is that the punishment is suppose to relate to the crime. ""A tooth for a tooth, an eye for an eye."" It looks like the judicial system separate between the seriousness of crime. Crime done against individuals have harsher punishments than crime done against society, probably because, people as individuals are much more vulnerable than a whole society. This of course, depends on the crimes dimensions.
The penal code is suppose to take care of the most important principle in our western legislation. That is Crime is not suppose to pay of. But is it possible for our judicial system to maintain this principle? I often read about cases in the newspaper where cases have been dismissed because the state of proof. This tells me something about many criminals, who are not punished as they should.
Let us look at one case from the latest years, the case about O.J. Simpson. This case has circulated in media for a long time, and it is hard to form an opinion about the question of guilt. In this case however, the accused had almost unlimited means to hire the best lawyer that was available, this lead to a game within the law, which in the end lead to finding the accused not guilty. Have justice then won? This was the question many people asked themselves when this case was closed. Competent lawyers carried on a cynical game on the edge of what was legal. It looks like it can be hard to separate between what is reality, and what is TV-entertainment.
I believe that we look at the lawyer as a moral person with noble motives for his actions, but reality can be more made up than that. When you see in the newspapers it looks like the most competent lawyers take the cases that get the most attention, because they involve prestige. The result is that ""petty criminals"" have to serve sentence for their crime, while the ""great criminals"" get off. The conclusion must therefore be that ""crime does not pay"" is a statement with great modifications.

NOHO1038,3.5,2.5,,,,,All armies should consist entirely of professional soldiers: there is no value in a system of military service,"
Many European countries have abolished compulsory military service, or they are currently working on it. Norway is one of the countries that still have it. Some people, especially those working for the army, navy or airforce, claim that we have to keep this general conscription in our country. They say that our very defence system is based on the national serviceman, and that the system is something very Norwegian. The latter can not possibly be a well-considered argument: 'we have had this for a long time, so we must keep it...'
Every man must contribute to the serving of his fatherland. Women can volunteer. But all males must serve, unless his physical or psychic health makes it impossible for him. First of all, that is not the entire truth; in fact, one may refuse to serve in the traditionally way (and do some kind of a community service instead). But to achieve this one may have to take the initiative and do a little work, so most people do not really think of this as an option. Secondly, many people do not have to serve at all. They are dismissed or rejected before even enlisted. I do not think it is much of an exaggeration to say that forty to fifty percent of the males able to serve do not.
Myself, I did my service in the Royal Norwegian Navy, onboard the frigate (a warship, gun-ship) KNM Narvik. As far as I remember the ships' crew consisted of 30 officers, 30 professional 'soldiers' (people who after finishing their service have signed a contract to continue as privates, but with a wage) and craft-men, and lastly 70 ratings (conscripts). When I was serving, Narvik participated in STANAVFORLANT (NATO's standing naval fleet in the Atlantic ocean). The fleet consisted of several frigates and one tanker from different NATO membership countries - USA, Great Britain, France, Spain, Germany, the Netherlands, Denmark and Norway. Narvik was one of the few ships with non-professional crewmembers. Although we did an okay job, I was always under the impression that the professionals onboard the other ships did better, and so did the few professionals we had. No doubt conscripts can do some jobs, like washing the dishes etc, without problems. But this is not the case. They are set to do jobs that you need more than 10 months (after the drill school for recruits) to learn.
My job was to be a radar operator. My place was in the operational room, and I was to compile a picture built on the contacts on my radar. Which vessels were enemies, which were allies? Gather the information and make an overview for the weapon officers. This was not an easy job, and it took a long time to learn. The position was originally meant for an officer, but this was not followed. My point is that things would function much better if the defence force, and at least the more complicated parts of it, consisted more of professionals, and less of 'rookies'. Another thing is that people who serve because they want to, and because they are interested in what they are doing are likely to do a better job than people who are 'forced' to do it.
Armies should consist of more professional soldiers than the Norwegian does. If this works in other countries, why not here? Even if our country is a small one. Remember that Norway is a member of NATO, and that an attack on one of them is considered as an attack on all of them.

NOHO1040,3.0,,,,,,All armies should consist entirely of professional soldiers: there is no value in a system of military service,"
I think this statement will be irrelevant for Norway. In a small country like Norway it would be difficult to have a defence force consisting of entirely professional soldiers. Norway doesn't have that many inhabitants necessary for a well qualified full-time defence service. It is much better that we have compulsory military service where a lot of people, mostly young men, get to learn something about weapon and defending a country. If it should be necessary to defend our country more people with weapon and defence knowledge would be available than if we had just a professional army.
If Norway has had an army consisting of just professionals and no compulsory military service, the country would have been vulnerable to small groups trying to take over the government of the country by using military power. We see it happens in other countries. By having a compulsory military service the power is divided on many hands. If a little group should decide to take over a country they would be fought back.
It is easy to loose contact with the everyday society when there is a system of professional defence. They have all the facilities they need themselves, like hospitals, shops, court system, police. It is important to keep in contact with the people of the country you serve, if not it will easily be ""them"" and ""us"".
I can see why some people want a system with entirely professional soldiers. Because there are advances for that in a bigger country than Norway. First, the quality of such an army would normally be quite high. They are trained and paid just to do a special job. By doing a certain job for years you'll be highly qualified. Most likely they are more motivated than an army consisting of a bunch of people that don't want to be there. When you are motivated you do a better job.
But to be able to establish a military system consisting of only professional soldiers
it is necessary with a certain amount of qualified people, if the amount needed is not available, it might be necessary to reduce the requirements to get a job as a professional soldier, which may lead to an army consisting people which are not that skilled and motivated as wanted and that again leads to an army of ""bad"" quality.
From my point of view Norway is better off with the system we have today since we are such a small country as since I believe in the power divided on several hands. I also think that the people of the county should contribute to their nation by spending a year in the military forces. But I don't believe in a compulsory military service for women. As long as the women have to give birth to children they shouldn't have to serve the country by attending the military services. If they had to do it they would then never be able to compete on the ""labour market"". Women contribute to their country by giving birth to new citizens.

Science, technology and industrialisation tell us a lot about our world today, but is this all we need? Maybe for some people, but for the most of us I think it's important to take care of the small things in life. Of course our life depend a lot on technology, just think about all the things we have in our homes; washing-machine, TV, refrigerator, and so on. Would you like to wash your clothes by hand? I don't think so. Of course all these things have made our life easier, but for not so many years ago our lives were much more primitive than it is today, and still in many countries they haven't got longer than that. People weren't stuck in front of the TV, and all the things that machines do for us now, they had to do with their hands and together with each other. Maybe there were more room for dreaming and imagination. People weren't so spoiled, and they didn't took everything for granted. They took more care of each other, and the family were more close and held together. But is our generation so spoiled, and are all we think of just getting a new car, the best computer or new clothes? Well, I think material things are very important for us, but in our minds I think we seek for something else. Maybe material things are just to cover over all our sorrows and problems?
We do need each others company! We need friends and family. We need someone to share our life with. We still have feelings, and we still have dreams. I don't think technology could ever take over that. Still we do seek after the simple things in life. To go with our families to a little hut in the mountains. Go skiing into the beautiful nature with our little rucksack and a packed lunch to eat in the free. We still want this pure and simple things. Just to take your dog for a walk in the forest on a sunny afternoon. Sitting on the top of the mountain looking out over the sea, and just imagination how your life will be. Lying in the grass, looking up in the sky, just dreaming. We have not become robots, and I don't think we ever will. It will not be like it is in science fiction movies. Well, I don't think so. Maybe some of it, but we will not loose our feelings, nothing can replace them.
We are still human beings, and we all have a dreamer in us. But yes, our world is surrounded of things that don't make us have to dream. Our dreams are already been made up, and everything can be bought for money. But for those who hasn't got so much money maybe the dreamer is more alive. I am a little dreamer, I think, and I don't have much money either.
We must not take away peoples dreams, that's what keeping us alive isn't it, our dreams. Think about a life without dreams and imagination, what a boring life that would be!

NOHO1043,2.5,3.0,,,,,"In his novel ""Animal Farm"" George Orwell wrote ""All men are equal but some are more equal than others"". How true is this today?","
If there is one statement that could cover the society we live in close to all times, this must be one of them. As long as man has been around, there has been a fight for power, land and even people. The Indians were less equal for some, like the English explorer Martin Frobisher said"" They live like animals"" And the story keeps on going, we had Hitler and Pol Pot.
And still people all over the world considers themselves more valuable than others. When thinking about this, you would think that some of the leaders of the world would keep an attitude against this, so there will be some equality. If you put a pig tale on a grown man let him stand on two feet, it will all probably look fairly funny, well it has happened, and I call him George Washington Bush, the President of United States.
Once someone wrote on a piece of stone, "" You shall not kill"" Sadly enough some think they have the right to do it anyhow. Are they more equal then their victims? I say no, and this is generally the opinion most people have. We condemn them by using the legal system. This is when the pig-tailed Mr Bush appears in the picture of being more equal than others, he probably read the same rule as we all did, about not killing others. The American way of thinking, is one of the strongest when it comes to the issue of freedom and justice, still they manage to get up in the morning to write Mr.Bush on a piece of paper and hand it in on election day. Having a legal system that actually agrees to death penalty is an enormous reason to believe that someone considers themselves more equal than any. How did Bush read the stone rule that most people live after? ""You shall not kill, but if you do, I will kill you."" Murder is one of the reasons that build upon the statement discussed, because if you kill someone, you take control over a life that you are not in power to control. So, when you kill someone, you put yourself above the victim and above everything that you can not control, and who then made you the boss over someone's life besides your own? This is the thought that many are left behind with after loosing someone close. Norwegian people are punished for their illegal actions, by prison, and exclusion from society. We are not allowed to kill, but in the United States this is ok. For Mr.Bush pulls the trigger himself and joins the line of murders that the society convicts. And if killing someone is not under the statement, ""but someone is more equal than others"" I do not know what is. The ones who kills actually put their life above the ones they kill, and then the murders just could have said, "" I am more equal then you"".
In 2001 the Americans elected the biggest pig of them all to run their country, like Germany elected Hitler in 1936. So if you have the wrong colour, wrong culture or background, or even at the wrong place at the wrong time, you never know what can happen- so be aware.
Time changes, but people with power do not. So maybe one day, if you have dark eyes and dark hair, you might not live the next week, wait that happened already. What is next? Who decides our destiny? I say we do. In the western world we choose our own leaders. So when we choose someone like Mr George Washington Bush, we have not got as far as we might want to. I stop to think that he must believe that he is more important, when he kills a killer to justify a murder. My father told me when I was young, two wrong do not make one right and just because someone does something stupid, do not mean that you have to do it. Maybe I could send my dad over there to raise this pig-tailed man.
So if anything is true, the statement George Orwell wrote many years ago certainly is. People act on their believes, but if your believes are that you have more right to kill someone, I have to say; turn your head one more time around when you put it on in the mornings, Mr Bush!

NOHO1044,1.5,2.0,,,,,Feminists have done more harm to the cause of women than good,"
This is an interesting start to a discussion of women`s rights, because a great deal of women today seem to deny feminism and look at the movement as some sort of a threat or something ridiculous to laugh about. First I would like to look at the word ""feminist"", because what does it really mean? What exactly is a feminist? We like to believe that women in the 18th and 19th century that fought for women`s rights were strong and powerful, had lots of talents and were good looking. Many women today, I am now talking about the western world, has got this romantic idea about the strong women in the last centuries fighting for their rights, but when it comes to our ""modern times"" it seems as if they feel deliberated and (almost) perfectly equal to men. Feminists today are often looked upon as ugly, angry women that do not have any boyfriends and therefore are angry and bitter towards men. It is a strange idea, but rather common.
A feminist can probably come in many forms and it is not as if a group of women can be recognised as feminists on the basis of their clothing, their sexuality or the way they speak. I do believe that feminists have changed, though, I think the idea that women should be as similar to men as possible to be equal to them is not as popular a view as it used to be thirty years ago. The women calling themselves feminists today are often using the so-called ""weakness"" that women tend to have as a kind of weapon or means to get to a different goal than before. Instead of trying to become men to fit the society and become equal to men, some feminists focus on the idea of changing society into a more ""womanly"" one, with much more interest in communication and co-operation than economy and power. And this brings us to the statement in the beginning of this text, whether feminists have done more harm than good to the cause of women in general. One may blame some feminists because of their consisting wish and desire to be like men, thereby helping change society into one where women need to act like men to feel equal to them. I believe the whole question of the cause of women is a far more complex one. A lot of what happened in the 18th and 19th century was deeply needed to change the cause of women, and incidents earlier as well. The women liberation was also strong in the 1960`s and 70`s, but in the decades after it seems as if the questions are not so many anymore and the issues are not so hot. (I am still referring to the western world as the situation in many other parts of the world is very different). The word ""feminist"" is used as an insult in many occasions, surprisingly often by women, but in spite of this I do not think many women would agree to the statement that feminists have done more harm than good. Considering the whole picture, western women today are satisfied and happy that women before them have demanded more jobs, respect for their sex, higher wages and more power within politics, religion and economy. That is also perhaps why some women feel almost ashamed over demanding even more, they think we have gone a long way and that the issue of women liberation is a bit out of date. Personally I believe that it is no longer so much a question of women liberation or women becoming more equal to men. It is more a question of how to make individuals work together, how to communicate with and treat people of the opposite sex whether you are a woman or a man. Human worth and respect are words that are far more interesting in our society today, than whether a woman should wear a bra or dress like a man. It is just as important for a man to adjust to a woman than the other way around and that is why it is wrong to focus on only one of the sexes as long as they have to live with each other.

NOHO1045,3.5,2.5,,,,,"Some people say that in our modern world, dominated by science and technology and industrialisation, there is no longer a place for dreaming and imagination. What is your opinion?","
I have a dream. These are the famous words of Martin Luther King Jr. I think a lot of people still have this dream. They dream of peace and harmony in the world. Not only peace between blacks and whites, but between all countries and races. If nobody had this dream what would the world look like? At the moment wars are going on in several countries. Some seem not to want peace, while others hope that one day all peoples will live as equals in harmony. This is probably the biggest dream of all and the most important one. However, smaller dreams are also important. And the road to peace starts with only two people becoming friends. It is a small step, but maybe the most important step on this road.
In everyday life we all have dreams. Some of us dream of a great job, winning the lottery, travelling to the other side of the world, or simply a happy family. A lot of these dreams never come true, as life is hard for most people. It is not easy to make it today, neither in the working situation nor in family life. Many have had their hopes crushed and stepped on several times. But usually they stand up and walk on. Their belief in their own dreams is what makes life worth living, and often a setback only strengthens their will to continue reaching for that dream.
Television, science technology and industrialisation have in some way replaced the need for using fantasy and imagination. Television gives us a picture of how things are, or rather how the media wants us to see things. Books give the readers an opportunity to imagine how the characters in the books look and act. This is an opportunity we even get from the radio. Cinematic versions of books give no room for imagination. In films everything is already decided for us. This is also the case in science documentaries. Everything is presented as a fact, and gives us no other choice but to accept this.
I think fantasy is a very important aspect of our life. We need to use our imagination to prevent our brains from decaying. When I was younger I loved to read books. I read at least a book a week and I had a great imagination. I enjoyed writing and I used a lot of fantasy in my stories. When I turned a bit older other things seemed more important than reading. And the only thing I read was my homework. Television more or less took over the books' role in my life. Lacking the books' influence my imagination suffered tremendously. I still enjoyed writing, but the use of fantasy almost disappeared. Recently I have regained my interest in books and I have already experienced that it has triggered my imagination. Hopefully I will continue to read books for the rest of my life.
I have dreams. I dream of an easier life, owning an apartment, becoming a millionaire, and maybe most of all I dream of love. I am a hopeless romantic. Even after getting my heart broken a thousand times I keep my faith in true love. That is one of the reasons why I get up in the morning. We all need to believe in our dreams. To me, that is what life is all about.

NOHO1046,3.5,3.5,,,,,"Some people say that in our modern world, dominated by science and technology and industrialisation, there is no longer a place for dreaming and imagination. What is your opinion?","
We live in a high-tech, modern world. I am truly amazed by all the fancy products from different industries that come up nowadays. It seems to me that almost everything is possible. At least we put a lot of effort in trying to make everything possible. Technology and industrialisation are dominating factors, and in our part of the world they affect everyone. Most of the education that people choose is also based on science and facts. The focus on general truths is characteristic of our time, and some may claim that there is no longer a place for dreaming and imagination.
We are all equipped with creative minds. There is no doubt about that. I believe that there is nothing that can ever stop us from using this human quality. Dreaming will always come natural to us, nothing can stop that. We cannot even control it ourselves. I think we are all dreamers, whether we are aware of it or not.
Dreams were sources for all the science and the technology products that we can get or use today. There was someone who had a dream about flying across the Atlantic, curing consumption or washing clothes in a machine. This is possible today and they are realisations of dreams. Even if we have what we need, we always search for something better. One thing leads to another, we want to take one step further. There are no limits for imagination.
Museums and exhibitions, people go here to dream and imagine and escape from the present existence. These are places that make us fantasise. How did people live in the past? What does this picture say? We are curious and want to make up our own minds and create our own versions of something. Society's focus on facts and real information is in the long run boring for most of us, and therefor it can be relieving to fantasise and dream about fictive stories and situations.
Our hobbies often involve dreams. The main force behind all kinds of art and culture is fantasy. Here there are no wrong or rights, no true answers. It is a matter of using imagination and to create something original and personal. Then it is up to others to make use of their own fantasy and try to get something out of it. For instance when you read a book your imagination creates your own pictures and ideas. Dreams are also central in sports, whether you are an athlete or a fan. As an athlete your central ambition would most likely be to work hard to reach your goals and realise you dreams. And as a viewer you fantasise about good victories for your team or your favourite athlete.
In my opinion imagination is a vital value in life and there is always room for imagination and dreaming if we search for it. It is important to get the most out of our spare time and make use of all our potential creativity and fantasy.

NOOS1003,3.5,2.5,,,,,Most university degrees are theoretical and do not prepare students for the real world. They are therefore of very little value,"
I find this statement very true indeed. After attending to three years of studying at the teacher's college of Telemark, I discovered that even though you make an effort through the entire semester, you're being judge only by your exam results at the end of the course.
So what if you have a bad day, at the day of the exam? What if you for instance have been so nervous that you haven't slept for the whole night? Well, the bitter truth is that you fail! You may have been at all the lessons, made excellent homework and hand-ins, but if you don't make this exam, then all the work is in vain. "" - Better luck next year, pal!""
My personal opinion is this: let the student's results through the course count fifty percent, and let the exam count fifty percent of the degree. Then your work through the year may be judged with your exam, and you get a more fair degree, and then you also study harder during the semester.
Another example of the uselessness of university degrees, is the fact that very little of what I learnt at the teachers college, can be used in real life. Most of my tutors at the teachers college had not been out in the real world school for 10 to 15 years. And when you, as a student, attend to practise in teaching at primary or secondary school, you have a practise-teacher and four other students with you. Then you keep babbling away about feelings, the right way to stimulate the pupils, what the other students did right and wrong, and so on. All it comes down to is a constructed situation.
Then you get a substitute-teaching job when you're finished. You discover that you're on your own, with thirty(!) noisy fifth-graders, and everything you have learnt about motivation, pupil-activity, and other pedagogical terms, floats in the theoretical sky, way above your head.
Your primary mission in the real world, is to keep pupils from fistfights, destroying school property, and maybe to teach them about one third of the material you had prepared for that lesson!
Therefore, should the tutors of universities and colleges, especially tutors in job-related education, been handpicked from the real world. They would tell us about how to cope with everyday problems, as for me, in the classroom. It was very little talk about how to behave in situations like fistfights among pupils, in my pedagogical classes at the teaching college.
My impression is that most of my former tutors had very little experience from the real world. They lived in a world of theory and books about what dead, old men and women had meant about children, during the past decades and centuries. It was more important to know the names of, for instance the behaviourists and what they meant, than how to comfort an eight-year-old, with bloody wounds on his knees.
So my conclusion is that universities and colleges must get a grip, and step in to the real world! Don't let them hide behind their desks and paragraphs, but get rid of all the tutors with no detachment to the everyday problems that the students must face, once done with their education. Bring in people that know how the system really works. Then, students might feel that what they're doing is worthwhile.

NOOS1007,3.5,3.0,,,,,"In his novel ""Animal Farm"" George Orwell wrote ""All men are equal but some are more equal than others"". How true is this today?","
The qoute ""All men are equal, but some are more equal than others"" refers to the situation on Animal Farm after the pigs had taken power by a coup d'etat. They changed the 7 commandments , which had previously been democratically agreed on, in their behalf. This single commandment divided society into classes and led to privileges for the ruling class, ending in totaliarism, dictatorship and tyranny.
We Europeans boast of living in a democratic society. Laws are democratically passed , laws protect us from violence and discrimination. Our politicians are legally elected, and the opposition in Parliament function to keep an eye on the government. But all the same, it turns out that ""some are more equal than others"". One might ask , are we all alike in front of the law? No! We all know that people with money which means power, more easily get away from akward situations , i.e. they can use their skill and money to have lawyers to help them. The man in the street, a lonely mother and old people can't afford an expensive lawyer to help them win a case.
We all know, at least women know, that they are treated differently from men. As a woman you have to be strong, well-educated, have faith in your own cause if you are going to win. Even if there are laws that say that women are to be qouted into different assemblies and
positions, it takes a lot of stamina to ""run the race"".
As regards races, we all know that, despite laws fo non-discrimination and ""all men are equal"", there are groups of people that are discriminated in our world today. So also in Europe, and Norway. There are still Lapps in Norway that want to hide their Lapp origin frightened that they might be discriminated or mobbed. Elsewhere in Europe we know the sad story of the Gipsy people. Even if we buy records of the famous ""Gipsy Kings"", many people wouldn't want their sisters or brothers in their neighbourhood.
In these days a political party in Austria that have Nazi-sympathies is invited to reign the country. We all know what human values the Nazis claimed. Nietzsche's Ubermensch is roaring in our ears!
In the Usa - despite Civil Rights that forbid discrimination of races, we know that African Americans still have difficulties in finding jobs and good housing and that they still are looked upon as second-class citizens. Can they blame themselves? Maybe, but about 300 years of suppression, slavery, manipulation and subordination don't leave you with mountains of self-esteem and pride. Such conditions don't give a boost to your guts.
As regards religion , the white Christian interpret his religion as the one and only true belief. We regard people with other beliefs and customs with suspicion and anxiety. There is a discussion in Oslo now whether the Muslims in one part of the town may call to prayer once a day during the week. Some politicians mean that such callings don't fit in in our society. Of course it is strange, but the Norwegian constitution state that we have freedom of faith in our country, so why make so much fuss of it?
These were just a few examples of how people are discriminated and treated differently today. So the conclusion must be that George Orwell's writings are still true.

NOOS1014,3.5,3.5,,,,,"In his novel ""Animal Farm"" George Orwell wrote ""All men are equal but some are more equal than others"". How true is this today?","
George Orwell was right in many ways when he said this in his famous novel ""Animal Farm"". The phrase ""all men are equal"" is a famous sentence from the American Declaration of Independence from 1776. When Thomas Jefferson and the others in the committee wrote this, they believed in a society where everybody, concern-less of their religious, political or social background, should be treated likewise and have the same rights.
But, history has showed that this would take a long time to be realised. As a matter of fact, even back then, racism appeared, and we can see it even more obvious in our modern society.
Today we learn that our society is still looking quite idealistic upon early class differences in England, due to the fact that some people consider themselves more valuable than others. Many are judgementive in their way of thinking that rich people are better than those who haven't got money. Today it is highly necessary to have money if you want to have a good life.
The question of equality has drawn more to the question of races the last decades. I guess it is wrong to call it races, but that is what most people consider people of a different culture, and most of all, with another skin-colour. The colour of your skin seems to decide what your future will bring. In western countries the white race is the dominant one, and also the absolute best one! Well, this is what most Europeans and Americans think. This is an extremely good example that some are more equal than others: White men knowledge of their own race being so much better than those of a different colour.
Despite the fact that people from the white race are well educated and ought to know that all men are equal, they somehow still consider whites as more equal and more loved by God. The majority of white people feel they are the best , mainly because they have a well-developed, rich and wealthy culture. When we talk about the coloured race, it's mostly the Blacks we're dealing with, because they are more visible. A great opinion is that blacks are not worth so much as whites because they doesn't know as much as us! In my opinion, this is very unfair, when we look at the reasons why it has become like this; the blacks have their origin in the poor part of the world, in many ways. Industrialisation, education, sanitary system etc. is not especially well developed there. That is why we call their countries underdeveloped. You might think that this is not quite true. Some African countries are developed with technology, factories, and cars and so on, but very often the goods of agriculture and factories are being exported to western countries for low prices. So, they remain poor.
It seems like man puts himself in Gods position and makes himself available to tell who are better humans, and who're not so good. I hope this development doesn't go any further, because where will it end? God created all men equal, both men and women, children and grown-ups, white or coloured.

I think it was last Monday... I came home from school, completely aware of the fact that this day would be a boring day, with a lot to read, a meeting at work and by the way my room looked like a...well, I don't think a messy place would cover the it... Anyway, as I opened the mailbox, I noticed that we had got the travel magazine for the season summer - autumn 2001. I hurried inside the house, called three of my best friends, asked them to come home to me, and there we sat, dreaming for maybe 4 hours before we decided to order a trip to Corfu in Greece. No matter how much technology and science there are, and no matter how industrialised this world is becoming, I really doubt that people will ever stop dreaming. Are we even capable of stop dreaming and imagining?
Well, obviously some people are... I once heard a very successful businessman say; ""I'm prepared on dying early. My body has dealt with so much stress and is so burnt-out that my age should be 85 years instead of 43..."" He worked with computers and said that they were his life. Life?? He hadn't had a week off work since he was 20, and the only time he saw his wife was when he got home from work and kissed her good-night. I really felt sorry for him... He was 24 years older than I was, and still I had seen more of the world than he had. He said he had been to Denmark twice- on meetings, and three times in Germany- on meetings. I probably had more dreams inside my head at that very moment as I listened to his interview than he had had through his whole life. The reporter who interviewed him was obviously as shocked as I was, and she asked him if he had ever imagined himself lying on a beach on an island far away from work and stress, and the answer he gave was; ""Workaholics don't have time to dream and imagine"". And even though the danger is small that it will ever happen, I have decided not to become a dreamless workaholic...
In 1841, the Englishman Thomas Cook arranged the first holiday travels with transfer, board and lodging included. These travels became a success, but only rich people could afford them. Today the problem has changed from not having enough money till not having enough time. Enough time to either dream or make the dreams come true. Our modern society has developed a very wrong idea. It's just as if you have the time to make your dreams come true or just sit in a chair one afternoon and let your thoughts sink into the world of a book, or as in my introduction, a travel magazine, then you're not busy enough! It's trendy to run down the street with a coffee in one hand and a brief case in the other. To be constantly pressed for time is the way life should be lived nowadays. Luckily, there are still many people who, so far, disagree with this modern world of ours. For most of us having time to dream is a part of our lives, and I guess most of us are dreaming without even planning to do it... As for myself, thinking is sometimes the same as dreaming.
For the average person a dream could be to buy an expensive car, to afford to build an inside toilet in your cottage in the mountains or to shop without thinking about all the money you're spending. At the same time, a rich person could be dreaming about spending a weekend in a silent cottage far up in the mountains without any luxury, to have the time to watch a football match on TV and to make dinner for the family. Isn't it weird how the grass always turns out to be greener on the other side of the fence? Rich people want time and the more average people want more money to get the opportunity to be busier in their spare time...
The burnt-out businessman can say whatever he wants. I don't believe him when he says that ""workaholics don't dream and imagine"". Because all around us there are pictures, names and memories that cling to our mind and start thinking-processes inside us... There is no chance that anyone can just turn off his or her imaginative part of the brain and only focus on work. Either we want to or not, we dream and imagine. And luckily, neither science, technology nor industrialisation can put an end to that...

This essay is about whether or not there are any place for dreaming and imagination in the modern world of today. Are we left any room for our own imaginations when our heads are filled over the brim with more or less useful information every day? We may be entertained by the television 24 hours a day, we may download information about nearly everything in the world on our computers, we don't even have to move outside our own houses to get food. In a world like this, is there really any room where we can be all by our selves, where we can think our own thoughts and use the creative abilities that lies within us as a potential energy source? I will try to show that this is still possible in our modern world, I will even try to explain why dreaming is the basic source of development of our species. But first I will define what I mean by dreaming.
What do we really mean by dreaming and imagination? Is it only what goes on in our heads at night-time? No, dreaming is a lot of things. Dreaming is using our creative abilities in a way that influences our lives and our surroundings. Most things start with dreaming or using our imagination. Like when one should choose a career in life, or when the 12 year old is working really hard to earn money for a new bike. The dream is like a carrot that keeps us going. Dreaming is also escaping from the world we live in, and this I will look into later.
Where would we be today if it was not for our ability to dream and use our imagination? A person that stops dreaming, that can't see oneself in an imaginary world, is a person with no personality. Then the main difference between human beings is then gone. As long as a person is dreaming and having ideas about one self and the surroundings in an imaginary future there is room for improvement an further development of the human species and the world we live in.
If Bill Gates did not have a dream that he could develop a computer-program that would revolutionise the world, where would we be today?
Dreaming and using our imagination is the modern Darwinism. We don't have to be physically stronger than our opponents to be the survivor in the society of today. What divides winners and losers in our world is more of an intellectual art. And the more able one are of having dreams and following these dreams in hope of fulfilling them, the bigger the chance of succeeding in this society of competition.
The fact that most people in the western world belongs to one or another religious foundation, is a proof that we are not capable of living a life without having any dreams. The more complex, ""smaller"" and faster the world becomes, the bigger is the need for something to believe in, something to escape to when we have had too much. Where people two hundred years ago sought comfort because they could not understand, people today seek comfort because they can't handle all the information. Believing in a superstitious being is using ones imagination, dreaming that there is something better.
One solid proof that there is room for dreaming and imagination in the society today we find within sports. How many thousands of boys and girls all over the world do not dream of one day standing on the podium receiving the gold medal. Not many get to the top, but I think we all have dreamt of being there. The dream of one day to have a victory over ones own fears and crossing the inner borders have driven many people towards achievements one would not have reached without dreaming.
I think it is wrong saying that there is no room for dreaming and imagination in our modern world. If it was not for dreaming the world would not work at all. Dreams may help us getting further in developing our surroundings. Dreaming is by my opinion the main source of creativity in our society. Dreams may also be a way of getting away from a complex world things happen fast and continuously. Even though the world has become smaller, even though less is left to our imagination, we still escape to our different dream worlds through our imagination.

NOOS1022,2.5,3.0,,,,,Feminists have done more harm to the cause of women than good,"
It has been said that feminists have done more harm to the cause of women than good. In my essay I want to give a historical background for the feminist movement before I discuss for and against this statement. It is important to remember that the goals of the women's liberation movement have varied widely from country to country. In Africa the feminists goal have been more basic, such as removal of the bride-price. In my Essay I will mainly concentrate on the historical situation in United States and western Europe.
Concern for women's rights dates from the Enlightenment with their liberal and reformism ideas. Mary Wollstoncraft wrote a book which was publicised in England in 1792, ""Indication of the Rights of Woman"". This book challenged the idea that women exist only to please men. Until nearly the end of the nineteenth century a wife was legally a man's property. The book also proposed that women should have the same opportunities as men in education, work and politics.
During the 19th century feminists most important goal was to obtain woman suffrage which they as a whole achieved during the first half of the 20th century. The rise of modern feminism came with the book ""Le Deuxieme Sexe"" (The Second Sex) written by Simone de Beauvoi in 1949. The book became a best seller and was based on the idea that liberation of women also was liberation of men. During the 1960th the Civil Right movement inspired women to try to obtain better condition through campaigns off mass agitation. In 1963 an American feminist, Bette Friedan, and other feminists founded ""the National Organization for Women"". Also in western Europe feminists established similar organisations. They wanted to change the woman image as a weak, passive, dependent individual and a sex object.
The feminist movement reach its peak in the 1970th. In the United States the feminists fought to pass the Equal Rights Amendment. Both in the United States and western Europe feminist agitated against the way mass media presented women.
If we look at the historical background for the feminist movement, it is difficult to take a statement as ""Feminists have done more harm to the cause of women than good"" seriously. It is important to remember that the life of woman must have been very hard. She had no legal rights, the man was the head of the family and a man thought of his wife and also his daughters as his personal property, and so did the law. In England, during the industrial revolution, women were forced to work like slaves in factories and workhouses. Until 1882, a woman had to give all her property to men when she married him. It was almost impossible to get a divorce, and until 1891, husbands were allowed to beat their wives. In 1850 this was a serious social problem.
What most people associate with feminism, is what happened in the 1970th.  If we look at this specific period, it may be possible to understand why somebody can say that feminists have done more harm to the cause of women than good. It is due to the fact that many feminists were extreme. Some of them acted like they hated men, and did not only want equal status with then, but a society run by women. Others believed that there were no difference between boys and girls, what made the difference was the way you were brought up and educated.
Another reason why some people think the feminists have done more harm than good, is because during a few years the situation of a woman was turned up side down. From her traditional role as wife, mother, and homemaker, it was now expected of her to be educated, get a job and participate in all area of public life. The main problem was that she still had the main role as a wife, mother, housekeeper, daughter, the social organiser and lover. Many women felt that even if they had obtained equal rights, men were not willing and ready to participate and share her former duties.  A women is not longer economical depended on a man. A result is an increasing number of divorces. In this new situation many look upon the children as victims.
During these 200 years of struggle, women have become independent. They have the same equal rights as men, they can participate in political decision-making and in all areas of public life. Still there is a main difference between the life of a man and the life of a woman.  For many women it is a main conflict between her traditional role as a mother and as an employee. Even so, most women gratefully appreciate the result of the women's liberation movement.

NOOS1038,3.0,,,,,,Crime does not pay,"
We hear from people all the time: Crime does not pay! Since the day we learned to walk and during all of our upbringing, we've been taught that crime is bad and it certainly doesn't pay. Think back to the happy days when you were five years old and you had a friend over to visit. Your friend had this urge for cookies and he wanted you to get him a cookie from the top shelf, and you, even though you knew it was wrong, climbed all the way up there, just to fetch him a cookie. This day, however, was not your lucky day, because the minute you put your hand in the jar, your mother walked into the room. The end of it, was usually this: Your friend got a cookie for being such a good boy, not climbing in the shelves. You, on the other hand, was sent to your room without a cookie and perhaps without dinner as well.
It makes me wonder. Does crime really not pay..? I'm sorry to say, this story tells us different. The real criminal in the story was not me, but my friend, my clever, clever friend, who tricked me into doing this bad things for him all the time. He was the real criminal and he got the reward!
Inside every one of us, there's a bit of my friend. The little clever one that lies in the back of our heads, just waiting to get an outbreak. Most people know how to deal with him and hopefully, we are among those people. But then again, there are people who don't, and for some of these people, crime pays.
There are different kinds of crimes. In most of them, the criminal gets his or hers punishment. But that are only the crimes we see, like murder, violating human rights robbery and so on. But what of crimes we don't see? The crimes that are invisible to us, or the crimes we don't want to see. Every day, most people get into their cars and drive off to work. Is that a crime? Well, if it is, it certainly doesn't pay! Shouldn't we protect our environment, rather than polluting it? There are other options like public transportation, but we choose to do it our way, and the ""reward"" is a dying world which we choose not to see.
An other form of crime is fraud. You may say it is the same as stealing, only in the ""dark"". It's hidden crime and it's everywhere, without anyone noticing. Perhaps your good neighbour is a criminal, stealing money from the government through tax fraud. Perhaps you do the same? Somehow it doesn't seem like a crime, does it? You are only taking what's yours, aren't you? Well, that's my little friend talking.
The fact that we are being told that crime doesn't pay, does not prevent us from doing it. Is that a sign that it in some cases actually does pay? Well, it's hard to say. We should, however, keep saying the opposite. That is what I am going to tell my children, and hopefully what they again are going to tell theirs.

Some people say that in our modern world, dominated by science, technology and industrialisation, there is no longer a place for dreaming and imagination.
In my opinion it is quite opposite! In these days of thunder and lightning(Read: Stress and overworking) people have a great need for dreaming. Our lives consists merely of hard work and money worries of some kind. Since professionals has uttered that depression is the greatest disease of our time, one can only think for one self that the reason for this must be that there is too little dreaming and imagining going on these days.
One can see, at least in the big cities, that centres of the occult and similar things, pops up on every street corner. In my opinion this can only be happening because PEOPLE NEED TO DREAM.
Asian ways of thinking are getting more and more popular, I dare say, even ordinary in our time. Since I am also one of those who need to escape the every-day stress and expectations, I feel I know what I am talking about.
I joined a Qui gong group some time ago, and I was really surprised to see what kind of people that attended this group. It was not only bohemians and weirdo's , but simple, common people, like the housewives you meet in the grocery store.
I think that people feel more and more empty. And are beginning to feel an urge to know where we come from, and why. I mean that their lives are so empty with only work, work ,work, that they need to know that there is some kind of plan with all this stress. Is this it? Is there really nothing more to it than this?
If we didn't go searching for the ""meaning of life"", I think the mortality age would be lowered with several years. Probably end up at 40 something. Heart attacks, depression and similar stress diseases will kill us all eventually if we keep up the paste that we have.
That's why it is so important to bring the Asian way of thinking into our every-day lives. It brings us inner peace and contact with our minds, in a way that keeps the stress level down.
Any way, if people think that it is to over do it a bit with all this Asian stuff, I think they have to just lie down on the couch and dream away every once in a while. Turn the world off, and pretend to be somewhere else, maybe. At least find a way that makes them relax, without having guilt feelings for not doing whatever it is they ""should"" be doing!
On the other hand, when technology are concerned, I think one with good reason can say that there is not much room left for imagination. Our homes are surrounded with television, video, computers, DVD, playstation, etc. How much room is left for the imagination? Not much, I dare say. I think it is sad to see children glued to the TV set, not interested in free play. In a while they might not be able to play on their own any more. Every family should have restrictions regarding how their children use the technology in their homes. It is important for the development of both their minds and personality that they engage in free play, and use their imagination as much as possible!
I have now uttered my humble opinion, hoping that more and more people agree with me! Not saying that my opinion is the right one, but that it is a healthy one!!!

NOUO1009,1.5,2.0,,,,,Crime does not pay,"
The prison system is most definitely outdatet. The prison system is most definitely not outdatet.
If the goal is to eliminate criminal actions: What kind of system will eliminate criminal actions?
If the question you choose to seek an answer to is this, both of the above answers could easily be defendet, or attacked.
My point is: Noone has yet found a proved answer to this question. And I will not dare to suggest a conclusion about what this answer is.I think many answers will be required at the same time. The closest thing I want to come to a conclusion is how to use the answers when they are finded.
The society can choose between different forms of actions. Hard, middle and low punishment. No punishment, but rehabilitation. High, middle and low supportative rehabilitation programs. Or a combination between these alternatives. Human beings are individuals. So are also criminal human beings. What will work against one type of criminal will might encourage another poosible criminal to become a criminal.
This calls for a complex answer(s).
I do not think there is anyone who can answer this question today. If the society really wants an answer to what will work they must be willing to use the method of trial and error. And to admit if they are wrong so they can change an ineffective system. (Then another question approaches: What politician will admit his system doesn't work? REEEAAAALLLY DIFFICULT TOPIC, THIS)
The society will have to establish limits of how far they will go in order to fight criminalism.
I look at it as a hierachically pyramide splitted into three parts: The top, middle and bottom. The top line (first brick) of the pyramide is the easiest and the least complex answer. The bottom line (the bricks at the lowest floor) represents the most complex answer. Both the top and the bottom line would represent a society without no criminial actions.
The top line (and the easiest answer) would be to kill all human beings. Bang! No more criminality.
The bottom line (or other end of the line) (and most difficult) would be to let all human beings live in peace (alive). And to let them live in peace (which I presume is the ultimate goal of a criminality fighting society) we would have to separate all human beings into their own small cells/areas. (Then we would all die anyway.)
(I do of course not think of the top line (or the bottom line) as the answer, but in a full picture of the whole mind system it must be there to represent the end of the line.)
In the second line to the top/bottom I presume it is possible one day to find bad genes and select or manipulate them. Top line: Kill everyone that has ""bad"" genes. Bottom line: Let the bad genes be plucked away by doctors.
In the two top lines of the pyramide as well as the two bottom lines, the society will have have to sacrifice a lot. The effort won't be worthed it.
The middle of the pyramide is in my figure the part with the most lines. In other words it is more complex. The lower the line, the more complex it gets. And the lower the line, more laws/regulations are required. This will require more experts. The more experts, the more laws. The more laws, the more laws to be broken. Show statistics.
Today the society is at the middle level of this pyramide. Therefore I think there will take more than a decade or a couple of governments to figure out what works. And whether the prison system ever through history has been at its hightest efficiency or lightyears outdated remains to see for those who come after us. But I think we should try. We should try rehabilitation programs. If they do not work, try new rehabilitation programs, and so on. But there can not be only one answer to criminal actions. The answers will have to be individual and therefore complex. The reason why I think it is worth trying is that the easiest choice always will be within the grasp of human beings. Many criminals are good at easy choices. Maybe we should ask them. They have at least tried other solutions to things.
My conclusion is as already mentioned that the society will have a hard time fighting criminality. And that a realistic approach would be to find the method that statistically works best.
So the society has to well define what to put in the word ""rehabilitated"". Then rehabilitate what statistically will lower the criminiality the most. Do not rehabilitate those who can't be rehabilitated. Punish them for all that it's worthed?

NOUO1018,3.5,2.5,,,,,"Some people say that in our modern world, dominated by science and technology and industrialisation, there is no longer a place for dreaming and imagination. What is your opinion?","
In this essay I will try to explain what my opinion is on whether dreaming and imagination is dominated by science technology and industrialisation..
Today everything is suppose to be very efficient and fast so I think the old way of thinking of dreaming and imagination is vanished. Such as if a child lived in a very isolated place he or she needed to pretend to have toys which did not exist and have imaginary friends. Also the dream of a better place to live for ones family was harder to achieve before the industrial revolution than today. Although it was specially in the western part of the world, but quite a few people still dreamed about it. Many people lived a very different life before the industrial revolution such as if a family lived on a farm where they all worked and gained little new information from others. They had to use their imagination to for example tell stories in the evening for the children. They did not have radio, television and internet where they could obtain new information, but had to use their own dreams and imagination on how the world was outside their town or village.
Even though I believe that the old way of dreaming has vanished I do not think it is gone completely, only changed. If we did not have dreams and imagination it would not be a healthy society because it would be a society without progress. A society needs dreams to develop new ideas and also the ability to imagine that the world can be very different in a hundred years time. Today we obtain ideas from all over the world because of internet, easy access to international newspapers and it is also much cheaper to travel. This also leads to a change in the way we are dreaming and our imagination because we can see with our own eyes how for example the pyramids in Egypt look like. Although our society has developed from depending upon the work from a human body it now depends on machines. People still dream of everyday subjects such as summer or winter holiday or a fancy new car or a boat, some even imagine sitting in a fast car some times when they are sitting on the bus home from work.
In may opinion it is not true that there is no longer a place for dreaming and imagination, but the words has changed its meaning from dreaming of a better life and have imaginary dolls and skis to use ones dreams and imagination to gain progress in society. It can also mean that many people dream of a simpler life without industry and technology and imagine themselves far away from a city to a more deserted place. I do not believe that a couple of hundred years with industry can change the human mankind completely and that it can take away the purpose and meaning of life for very many people.

NOUO1025,3.0,3.0,,,,,Feminists have done more harm to the cause of women than good,"
I believe that this statement is used, unfairly, by people who disapprove of the feminists` radicalness in different times. In their opinion, the feminists have, among other things, changed the old consept of family. For instance, a result of the feminist movement in the 1970s, is more divorces. Women can get out of marriages if they have been treated badly by their husband.
The suffragette movement wich started in the late 19th century, resulted in womens` right to vote in the early 20th century. Feminist have managed to change the way society look at women and the way women view themselves. A woman`s reputation was earlier the most preassus thing she had. After ""the sexual revolusion"" one have acknoledged that women have needs the same way as men does. Women throughout the western world have got new opportunities and possibilities. They choose higher education, which lead to economic independence and more freedom for women in general. A concrete result of feminism in the 1970s is women`s right to have an abortion.
Young women today cannot identify with the term ""feminism"". Even though many women feel that still, there are areas in which men and women are not eqal, they will not be indentified with the ""un-feminin"", angry women that ""hated men"". I think that is where the feminists in the 70s were wrong. They had to many rules according to how women should look and act. Today, girls and women do not feel at home in that discription. They are individualists. They want to be respected in the same way men are respected; like individualists. That is why a new feminist movement arose in the late 90s. They call themselves ""the new-feminists"" or the ""Gucci-feminists. They feel that there are areas in wich they still have to fight. The issues are not as concrete as the ones that their mother-generation were fighting for. One example is domestic chores. Now that almost as many women as men have a job outside the home, women tend to be the ones who have to to all the work at home as well.
One negative effect of feminism which can be seen in this time, is the negative signals that espessially women give to other women if they choose to stay home, taking care of theur children instead of having a career. Women should be able to chose what they want to do without getting reactions that they are anti-feminsits.
In my opinion, feminism has not done much harm to women. The feminists have been radical in all decades and therefore thay have gotten a bad reputation. I believe though, that there has to be radicalism to create a norm. There are negative effects, but simply because there is still a long way before men and women are equal in all areas.
The fight for women`s rights is really a fight for human rights. Women should have the same opporunities as men.

NOUO1027,3.5,3.5,,,,,"Some people say that in our modern world, dominated by science and technology and industrialisation, there is no longer a place for dreaming and imagination. What is your opinion?","
Dreams and imagination are the source of progress and development. Without them our society would stagnate and change would be impossible. Human beings are equipped with an ability for conscious innovation. If we were to cease dreaming and using our imagination, our society would not evolve and new solutions to everyday tasks and problems would not be thought out. If one takes a look at the twentieth century on an industrial, political as well as a social level, one would be hard pressed to maintain that this was a century without change and productivity.
That our society is dominated by science, technology and industrialization, to me, is not an indication that dreams and imagination have been made obsolete. On the contrary, the development of these three would not have been possible if people did not make use of their imagination and pursue their dreams. The invention of the aeroplane did not come about without someone dreaming about the possibility of humans flying, nor without endless hours of creative planning at the drawing board. The theories and hypotheses of science are likewise the outcome of active minds and imagination.
Science, technology and industrialization are, in a sense, dreams and imagination made practical. One may say that much of modern technology is designed to ensure that we have more time to devote to our individual pursuits and dreams. Through inventions such as washing machines and vacuum cleaners, we no longer have to spend as much time on menial tasks like housework. Travelling is made easier and faster by the use of cars, trains and aeroplanes. The internet offers us knowledge and inspiration from all corners of the globe, perhaps making our dreams more accessible in some ways.
Some might argue that our focus on the acquisition of material goods and the time-consuming juggling act of managing both a career and a family, curb our imaginations and leave us with no time to dream. I would argue, however, that leading such a hectic and stressful lifestyle makes one's imagination an essential tool in overcoming obstacles such as time shortage. In our modern world, at least in western society, one is obliged to be creative in a greater variety of arenas than members of previous generations were. For instance, both men and women are now expected to get an education and have a career along side having a family. Whereas in previous generations, women were solely home makers, and men concentrated on their careers, and were more marginally involved with the practical aspects of raising their children.
Perhaps the fear that there is no place for dreaming and imagination in our modern world is in reference to aesthetic arts. In my opinion there has been no decrease in the production of music and visual arts owing to our focus on science, technology and industrialization. In fact, modern technology has contributed to an increased variety of media with which to create art. Photographs, film and electronic music and animation have been made possible through modern technology. Within the genres of painting and sculpting we have seen the emergence of cubism, surrealism and abstract art, to mention a few. This shows that there is ongoing development in the classical forms of art as well.
In my opinion, the fact that our society is so centred on science, technology and industrialization, is evidence that dreaming and imagination is an integral part of human nature.

In the world we are living in we are bombard with impressions from morning to night. Visual media as tv, magazines, movies and the internet bring more pictures and text into our heads than we can absorbe. We don't to the same extent as before make images in our minds ourselves. When we read a book it is our imagination that to a strong degree creates the setting. As viewers to a movie the setting is given to us for free. A lot of children, as well as adults, these days use much of their spare time to watch tv and play videogames. Fantasy developing activities are replaced by games where the rules are allready made. The way we entertain ourselves nowadays seem to be by adding ourselves to the allready made product.
On the other hand this products can also be seen as stimuli to our dreams and our imagination. To use the internet as an example- all the information we can find on our computer could work as an inspirator to our fantasy. We learn about things and places that are out there somewhere and that gives our brains a push. Just think of how the different parts of the world are brougt into our living room by television, movies, the internett and so on. By seeing and learning about all theese places we can easier use our imagination and think about how it would be if we went there for instance.
I look at our society as a demanding society. The fast developement craves that we are thinking human beings. And just because the standard is so high we can feel pressured to be creative. I also think we are drawn to a dreamworld because the world we are living in can seem cold and impersonal sometimes.
Because of the enormous flow of information we are exposed to, it may be difficult to fill our minds with thougts of our own. The modern world requires experts on so many fields and we know that they exist. Every day we make use of several inventions that we don't understand completely. We are getting used to be surrounded by such complexity. A result of this could be a kind of passivity. A bumper to our imagination. We may not be as eager to invent new things or dream of some revolutionary invention, because the world has come so far allready. And we don't see the need to find solutions to our problems ourselves.We tend to relax in the belief that there will allways be somebody better qualified for the job than ourselves.
I think human beings are dreamers by nature. We are born with intelligent minds wich give us the possibility to think beyond the physical world around us. And therefore we will allways have the need to fantasise and dream. The question is maybe rather if the dreams have changed as a result of science technology and industrialisation. We know more about the world than before. And we certainly have knowledge on different fields than we did before. Then it would be logic that our dreams were of another content than earlier.

Our modern world surely is dominated by science, technology and industrialisation. Greater demands in terms of efficiency in today's working society may give people less time to relax and escape from these strenuous conditions. Furthermore, the way students in school are being prepared for their future occupations may seem a bit ""mechanical"". There is often little room for individuality and alternative perspectives.
The students and people in general spend a lot of their spare-time watching television, a ""product"" of the modern world with an enormous impact on society. Some people say that television weakens the creative abilities of human beings, and effects of this technological invention is one of my main concerns discussing dreaming and imagination in our modern society. Everyone needs a place in their lives for dreaming and imagination, but do they have the time and energy to find this place?
Advanced technology and industrialisation may be said to create problems in at least two ways. Firstly, the strenuous working environment often leaves the worker exhausted and without any creative energy. An increasing number of people get ""burnt-out"" as a result of the physical and emotional pressure they experience in their jobs.
Secondly, some of the new ""high-tech"" inventions like television and Playstation may deteriorate people's creative abilities. Children use an enormous amount of time in front of their TV-sets. Instead of building their own little car and arranging a race in the streets, children nowadays play ""Formula 1"" on their Playstation. Several hours a day in front of the tv- or the computer screen can be said to make young boys and girls more passive and less industrious.
The media expert Neil Postman suggests in one of his books that television makes children lose their childhood. Childhood should be a period of innocence and wonder, but today's children may be said to experience fewer surprises. Television is a very strong medium with both picture and sound, which leaves nothing to the imagination. The television reveals everything and children are at a very early age exposed to the adult world, and quickly they try to partake. This is an unfotunate speed of development, because children should to a greater extent flourish naturally through games and other activities both on their own and with other children. They should not be involved with adult perspectives and problems before they are prepared to understand and cope with them. The basis of a person's creative abilities is developed during childhood, and this should not be the stage of life where all the secrets of the adult world are revealed.
People are still dreaming and using their imagination, although the content of their dreams and the nature of the imagery may have changed somewhat. Unfortunately, some people try to broaden their horizon through artificial means, like for instance drugs. Of course we're better off exploring for example meditation or taking a walk in the mountains to make the thoughts spin. Another opportunity is the book medium, which seems to be immortal. Why is it that the book seems to survive all changes in society? Maybe because reading one is an oasis for our imagination: We can, in contrast to a movie on TV, create our own mental imagery. Through our imagination we're able to shape images of the setting and of the different characters.
In my opinion human beings will always find a place for dreaming and imagination. Because of the sometimes extreme pressure people are experiencing, and this pressure is only increasing, they have a strong need for relaxation and recreation. It is crucial for people's mental health to engage in other activities than daily routines and job-realted matters.

NOUO1033,3.0,2.5,,,,,All armies should consist entirely of professional soldiers: there is no value in a system of military service,"
Norway, as many other countries have what we call a system of military service. That means that a number of the population have to spend a certain amount of their time learning to defend the country, or maybe even fight a war.
I believe everybody has an obligation to defend ones country. It is the duty of everybody when enemies attack your country. By military service is about much that that. It is also about being part of an invasion of another country, about killing human beings - maybe even civilians for a cause you might not agree with. It is about helping destroy another country and setting in back politically and economic for maybe decades. It might even be about destroying your own land and killing your own people if you are in a civil war.
I feel that no person should be forced to aim a gun at another person, just because your nation says you have to be part of a military service. And I think it is wrong that a government can force anybody to spend time defending or fighting for something they might not believe in.
I believe that if an army consists of entirely professional soldiers we will have a much better defense. Professional soldiers are soldiers by choice, and you will therefore have an army consisting of people who are committed to their job. A country with compulsory military service can end up having an army, which is not the best one to defend the country in a time of emergency because they are not committed by choice.
There is also the issue of cost effect. Upholding an army cost a lot of money. A Professional Army might me more cost effective because they might be able to have fewer soldiers doing the same job compared to a compulsory military system. I believe that economists will agree that people who are more committed to the job and even like their job, can get the work done faster that others who merely are there because they have to
One of the problems with professional armies is that many countries are too small. I don't think a small country like Norway can get enough people to enlist voluntarily for the army. We have to have compulsory military service in order to get enough people to fill up the positions. A possible solution to this problem is to set the defense of the country out to others. Iceland is a good example on that. The country does not have an army of their own, but rely on USA and NATO to defend them in a time of emergency.
I don't believe in a system of military system. Mainly because I don't think people should be forced to kill one another, but also because of the other things I have explained here. Still, I don't see how a small country like Norway can do it any other way. The army we have today is too small to defend Norway alone, but at least we have something to rely on until we get help from the other allied nations. Maybe it is important for the people to have an army to believe in even if it is not as effective as they might think.

These days our world may be dominated by science technology and industrialisation. However, one may argue that this technology once was dreams people, such as scientists, had. The thinking robot once was a dream that thrilled our imagination. You found him in Isaac Asimov's books, for example. People began to build robots and by time they became so advanced that they could think. If we look at it like this, one may see that even in the technological and industrial field dreams help to create new technology.
Still, others may argue that science technology and industrialisation have taken control over itself. It has become a thinking robot. This means that those who work in this field have become victims of the technology - the technology controls the human being, the man has become a slave with no imagination.
This was about the dreaming and imagination within the science technology and industrialisation. Outside the scientific circle there are people who struggle to realise their dreams or even to have dreams at all. There is a huge pressure hanging over them. One has to take the right education, which hopefully will lead to the right job. Somehow the way from education to work seems to follow a tendency in the society, one may call it the mainstream. In this mainstream people seem to have lost their dreams. They may think they have a dream but the dream is the same for everyone in this mainstream. Lets call it the 'fashion dream'. The dream is created by society that need one particular worker. In our modern world this worker tends to be working for the information technology. First and foremost this means working with computers and Internet.
In our modern world it seems that we do not have time to anything and the information has to come to us as fast as possible so we do not waste our time. This time saving process is to be developed by these who work with the information technology. However, if you are not creative and use your imagination fast enough, someone else will come up with an idea that will give us the information we need, faster than we did before. This could be an example on how we need our imagination, even if we follow the mainstream and the needs in the society. It also illustrates how stress develops. We cannot find time to breathe and think about who we really are, and the most important thing seems to be our job. This is how we ruin ourselves as human beings. We are born as originals but die as copies.
Still, there are those who deliberately avoid the mainstream and believe it can take care of itself. It could be that they find no interest in the information technology or the technology as such, they have another dream or perhaps not a dream at all or they see that the society will not be in balance if everybody goes in the same direction. Sometimes they are looked at as the outsiders, however, they are a very important key to the world and society we live in.
The modern world we live in today is no less a place for dreaming and imagination than the world people lived in centuries ago. When our dreams and creativity die, we die.

NOUO1040,4.0,3.5,,,,,The prison system is outdated. No civilized society should punish its criminals: it should rehabilitate them,"
I do not really think that the prison system is outdated. I do, however, think that several areas of the politics and philosophy BEHIND the prison system is outdated. In particular, I think this applies to the way we treat our drug-criminals.
As an example, I refer to the incidents around the famous american actor Robert Downey, Jr: After repeatedly having broken his probation, when being stopped by the police for speeding, they found cocaine and marihuana in his car. He was sentenced to one year in jail, and was released this August. Now, many people would probably say he deserved this sentence, that he may even have needed it, to be woken up and maybe be scared into making some changes in his life. I do not think that is the case. I do not think that to be the case in mostly any situations dealing with drug-addicts.
My point is, I do not think that drug-addicts should be treated as criminals in the first place. I think that the last 30 years have served only to show us that our war on drugs has failed. We have lost, and it is about time we understand that making drug-addicts into criminals SIMPLY DOES NOT WORK. All it does, is adding weight to the burden allready on their shoulders. We need to understand that drug-addiction is a disease, not a crime. Yes, it may mainly be a self-inflicted disease, but it is still a disease, and diseases should be delt with in hospitals and rehabilitation institutions, not in prison. In the words of thousands of RDJ-fans all over the world: ""REHAB FOR ROBERT, NOT PRISON!!"" :)
This said, I do not think we should stop punishing drug-sales, especially to kids and youths, or other crimes connected with drug-abuse, like robbery, murders and so on. I am not advocating the point of view which some people seem to have; that because someone is a drug-addict (poor little thing!), he should not be punished whatever he/she have done. Of course, if you robb or kill someone, or sell drugs to a kid, you should do hard time! Absolutely! I just mean that no-one should be sent to jail on the sole reason that they are drug-addicts or -abusers. In stead of this, I think we should start using more forced rehabilitation. Of course, most politicians would blast out in a rage when they hear this, screaming about the money they would have to spend on building the required rehabilitation institutions! What everyone seems to forget, is the fact that we allready spend millions of dollars each year on jugdes, and on keeping these people imprisoned, and it is mostly not doing the least bit of good to anyone! I think, that once we get past the initial disbursements, and the wheels start turning, we will actually save money! Now would not that be nice?
If you take a look at the Netherlands, this is exactly what they are doing, is it not? Using drugs is not forbidden there, so instead of worrying about how to get away from the police, and how to cover up their crime, they can actually spend their time, money and efforts on how to get rid of the addiction! And inspite of what you might think, there are NOT much more drug-addicts in the Netherlands than what there is in Norway or the United States. In fact, there are less! And in addition, they do seldom occupy prison cells that could otherwise be used to punish real criminals like murderers, rapists and robbers. And I for one actually think that sounds nice!

NOUO1041,2.5,4.0,,,,,"In his novel ""Animal Farm"" George Orwell wrote ""All men are equal but some are more equal than others"". How true is this today?","
In this essay I will try to show that this statement might be true to a certain extent concerning the relationship between men and women, different social classes, the shift in the financial balance between the countries and so on. Here, I will only comment the situation in western Europe.
The relationship between men and women:
The balance between the sexes is a question which is constantly on the agenda, not at least in , the Western part of the world. The conditions in society have changed during the last two hundred years from being mostly based on agriculture (farming, fishing, working in the woods: mainly done by the MAN in the family while his wife brought up children, cooked, did the mending on the family's cloths, but of course, they all worked when the corn was to be harvested in the autumn, the seeding in the spring and so on and so forth).
In the 1880s, with the industrial revolution and the founding of political parties, women were needed in the production of goods in the factories, met other ""sisters"" in the same situation, organized (the suffragettes) and finally started campaigns which led to the first goal: equal right to vote for men and women. In Norway, as far as I remember, this happened in 1913.
During the last (20th) century, women fought for their rights and the peak point in this struggle appeared in the late 1960s and 1970s. At this time there were more or less revolutionary tendencies which swept over the entire world. In Europe, it had started between World War I and II: the revolution in Russia (which changed its name to the Soviet union in 1917, starting a regime which ended its days as a super power in the 1980s).
This started political movements and parties in the western European countries. The general idea was: ""all men are equal"" and women took an active part in the work with rebuilding the society after the wars. The view on the ""female role"" shifted - very slowly from the old:
""The Women's Place Is In The Kitchen!""
- to a more balanced view where men had to admit: in many fields, the women are as fit to do the job as men!
The civil war in Spain in the late 1930s between the fascists led by General Franco and the communist, showed also that women took their part of the struggle , likewise in the Vietnam war, which became ""a hot potato"" for the US. These wars - and the rebellion in Paris in 1968, gave the whole political atmosphere in Europe a push to the left, a political climate which did not cool down before the late 1970s, introducing what was called in Norway: ""Jappetid"".
During these ""revolutionary"" years, a movement for female rights, called ""Kvinnefronten"", organized thousands of women, gave them a new ""identity"" (ref.: ""I'm black - and I'm proud!""). The result: Today womwen have entered many leading positions in the western europe society, even become professors in the Universities, but there is still a long way to go before the wages are equal in many sectors in the society.

NOUO1042,3.5,3.0,,,,,Feminists have done more harm to the cause of women than good,"
Feminism is a word with many different connotations. When I explain to people that I'm a feminist, they usually assume I would tell a man off for opening a door for me, or for picking up the check. Not at all! I'm delighted if a man notices me enough to open a door, and if I ever had a date who would pick up the check, I would, as a poor student, be sure to appreciate that as well.
On the other hand, if a man asked my father's permission to propose to me, I would probably refuse him (regardless of my father's opinion). Even though that tradition may seem romantic to some, I would be insulted. I don't mind being treated respectfully, but I do mind being treated like an object. To use the words of Rebecca West: ""(...)people call me a feminist whenever I express sentiments that differentiate me from a doormat..."" (The Clarion Nov 14th)
But what is the cause of women, and what has feminism got to do with achieving this aim? I believe that the cause of women is to be appreciated as equal to men. It is that simple. We may be different in physical appearance and strength, and even in development in different parts of the brain, but who is to judge which is better? We are equal in worth!
Equality between woman and man should also signify that we have the same political, economical and social status. That is where feminism has had its influence. Through the work of the suffragettes, who really suffered to establish the right to vote for women, we have got the same opportunity to influence the political system.
When women started working, especially during World War II, we slowly entered the economic sphere and gained influence there as well. And with these developments, the social system changed and it is now illegal to deny women the same rights as men. (In our culture.)
This has been a slow process, and the fight for equality is not over yet. Professions dominated by women have generally lower wages than positions traditionally held by men. Not to mention that all over the world there are places where women are considered to be mere slaves! The belief that women are less worth than men is still deeply rooted in many people's minds. Among these people are many women! Without feminism, I think this assumption would have been a universal truth.
However, feminism may have taken this battle a bit too far. As I indicated in the beginning, associations around feminists are usually concerned with burning of bras and telling people off for being polite. The war-like battle and aggressive fighters of different periods in the ""combat for equality"" may have created an image or a symbol that has overshadowed the cause itself. In fighting for equality between the feminine and the masculine, it could be that we have assimilated too much to the masculine side and left behind the core of the cause: Women (as women, not as men with skirts) are equal to men! The object is not to become men, but to achieve acknowledgement for being women.
I do not think that women would have the opportunities we have now, if it had not been for feminism. It was extremely important to direct attention to the fact that women were being ignored. But women nowadays are not generally ignored, and I find it more important to work for equality than women's rights, even though these might be synonyms today. We have to stress that we do not want a change from a patriarchal society to a matriarchal one, we want a society that understands that man and woman are created equal... We are not feminists, we are humanitarians.

NOUO1043,2.0,,,,,,All armies should consist entirely of professional soldiers: there is no value in a system of military service,"
In the following essay I will examine the statement above and look at the different arguments in favour of, or against, compulsory military service. I will, to some extent, be speaking on the basis of my own experiences in the Norwegian Army, in which I served for 12 months.
In several countries today there exists a system of compulsory military service, for instance in Norway, Sweden, Russia or Israel which means that all physically and mentally fit men
(in Israel, also women) are required to spend some time receiving military training.
In other parts of the world, for example in the UK or the US, military service is voluntary.
The statement above states that there is no value in a system of military service.
What does ""value"" mean in this context? That compulsory military service is of no use to society, to the individual, or both? What reasons are there to maintain a system of military service?
The main reason must be to keep the state in question safe from attack from a foreign power, posing the question: is this best done with professional armed forces, or with a military system based on conscription? The answer to this varies greatly from nation to nation. For instance, the Norwegian Defence is a so-called ""invasion defence"", based on an imaginary threat from the former Soviet Union. Its primary goal in case of an invasion is to hold up the invader for a short number of days, until Allied forces can be deployed in the country. It is argued that a professional Norwegian army would not be large enough to maintain this sort of defence, which requires a relatively substantial amount of troops. The UK has a larger population than Norway, and does not keep a large standing army in peacetime. Instead, the country tries to keep a relatively small, well-trained army of professional soldiers and officers. Therefore, it can afford to keep the military system on a voluntary basis.
On the other hand, a lot of young men, having been forced into the armed forces, do not feel very motivated to go through a year or more with military training.
The argument would be that with a voluntary military system, those volunteering would be more motivated and more inclined to do service, and thus make better soldiers.
This is partly true, if we keep in mind each nation's special needs. Israel, for instance, with a population of roughly 5 million, is surrounded by traditionally hostile states, and it is possible to imagine that the soldiers are motivated enough by this. In addition, it is probably a good idea to have almost the entire nation weapons-trained, in case of surprise attack by Arab states.
This brings us on to another argument. Is it possible that professionally based armed forces tend to get detached from society as a whole and become small enclaves that the rest of the nation rarely gets in touch with? Is this unfortunate in a modern democracy? Maybe it is a good idea to have non-professionals in the armed forces to avoid this, and to keep a check on the military.
Seen from the individual's point of view, what does compulsory military service mean?
In Norway, it seems that a lot of people feel that the usual twelve months of service constitute ""a wasted year"". It could be used in other ways, for instance, studies or work. Many do not even get more than three months of military training, and are then sent off to do office work, making the service close to meaningless.
Although the conscripts' pay is low, the welfare system is relatively good, and it is possible to participate in a wide range of educational classes.
This brings us on to a social aspect: In the UK or US, the military system represents a career possibility for youths, some of which have been into trouble with the police. The pay is good, and you can sign up for many years, if you like. This is not feasible in Norway, where you are not allowed to have any police record at all if you want to go through with officer's training.
In this way, the military system acts as a sort of safety valve, giving opportunities to many individuals on the wrong track in society.
The arguments in favour of, or against, compulsory military service are many, and the debate in the West must also be seen in view of the new security situation in Europe.
In Norway's instance, maybe the time has come to phase out the ""invasion defence"" (and with it, compulsory military service), which regards Russia as the primary enemy, and replace it with a smaller, highly trained military force which could make a more solid contribution to NATO's Rapid Reaction Force.

NOUO1046,3.0,2.0,,,,,"In his novel ""Animal Farm"" George Orwell wrote ""All men are equal but some are more equal than others"". How true is this today?","
When George Orwell wrote ""All men are equal: but some are more equal than others"" he meant, from my point of view, that in a society where everybody is supposed to be treated equally, you will automatically find leaders who take advantage of their position and feel that they have a right to be treated differently than the great mass. Some people have to make the rules, distribute goods and take decisions, and in Marx's ideal world these people would not be treated differently than the workers. In practice we have seen, both in the former Soviet Union and China, how the exact opposite has taken place. The leadership controlled the mass with propaganda and led themselves a life in extreme luxury hidden from the eyes of the hard working people.
How society is supposed to function in order to make people live in harmony together, has been a topic all the way back to the first civilizations. Many great men and women have had opinions on this exact matter. Sokrates was the first who started questioning the way people were living and how the leaders were controlling them. He meant the democratic method, where the free men chose a leader, was the best method in order to have a peaceful society where people were happy and satisfied. Today we can of course question if his policy really was democratic the way we see it, since the persons who could vote had to be free men with a certain income and also fulfill some other demands.
Many ideologies have been suggested and tried out in different societies during the years. In the novel Animal Farm, George Orwell criticizes the Communism and the way people are being controlled by powerful leaders, something that is in great contrast to how Communism was meant to be when the theory first was suggested by Karl Marx. The ideology of the Communism is based on equality amongst people and that there shouldn't be an upper class. People should work hard and only get what they needed in their daily lives. Luxury and other material benefits should not exist. The reality was that the leaders took advantage of their power and lived their lives in great wealth, while the workers were struggling to make the ends meet.
If we said today that some people are more equal than others, we would probably hear many protests. Because we live in a democratic community where we elect our leaders who can easily be replaced if they abuse their power. Most of the western countries have freedom, liberty and equality as the main points in their constitution, and have together shaped the human rights which stress the value of each individual person.
On the other hand we can criticize many things in our modern society. There are certain groups of people who are not as wanted as others. I can mention e.g. the African American in the USA. They have been discriminated for many centuries and even today they have trouble being accepted as fully Americans. There has never been a colored president to this day.
In Norway we find some resistance against immigration. This is a contradiction to the fact that we support the human rights. We are not willing to let everybody take part of our wealth. It's easier for a European to get a license to stay in Norway, than for a Palestinian or a person from Iraq. We filter the ones don't want.
The big organizations and unions are becoming more important to each country. The European Union has a great influence on all the members and also on the countries nearby. There are people elected to preserve the interests of all the countries and to decide rules and laws. Even though we don't think it's possible for anyone to abuse the power in this sort of organization, we have seen that this is not a fact. Recently the whole leadership had to be replaced because of corruption. They also drive fancy cars and stand out from the crowd.
I could also list other ethnic discriminations in our modern community, as the blacks in South Africa, the Albanian people in Kosovo and the Lapps in Norway. These have all experienced that some people are more equal than others.
In practice it's difficult to create the perfect community where all differences between people are eliminated. Many people have made great theories on the paper, but when they have been tried out in real life, we se a tendency that they fail, or become different from the plan. As a conclusion I think I can say that the only place where some people are not more equal than others is on the paper, not in real life.

NOUO1048,2.0,2.0,,,,,Crime does not pay,"
Beeing the son of a policeman I think I am fit for answering the statement made in the title. It has surely affected my life so far and definetly will in the future.
Ever since I was thrown into this world by my mother I have been taught that one should always follow the law. Why? Because your father is a cop and you wouldn`t want to embarrass him now would you? Now don`t get me wrong here. I understand completely that without some limitations and rules the society would be a rather chaotic place, but one should be allowed to manipulate or twist the law just a little bit sometimes. But with me beeing Mr. Law junior I never have had the chance to do that. I may seem a little bitter about that fact and I guess I am. One of my earliest encounters with the devlish art of law breaking was during my first year at school. Of course this wasn`t me doing the breaking but one of classmates or should I say inmates. The classical theft of candy was my first chance to see a criminal in action. And yes you could have guessed it, he got caught. I almost have to laugh when I think of it now. He was by god the worst thief I have ever seen. The first rule of stealing is to make sure that you don`t have anybody watching you at the very second you make your move, so to speak.. He did not and therefore he got caught by the baddest 120 kilo grocery store manager you have ever seen. The mean manager pulled him crying into his office and yelled at him so damn loud that to this very day not a singel student at my old school has stolen as much as a paper bag while he was on the job. But this incident or should I call it accident got my little head thinking. Even though he got caught I couldn`t help thinking of how easy it must be to steal if you just use your head and plan in advance what you are going to snatch. This was the start of a brilliant career. I started off easy taking only candy and your ordinary groceries like condoms and serial boxes. The thing was that after I had gotten out of the store and not getting caught I always went back in and put whatever I stole back on its shelf. I didn`t get busted once. Of course this was only the beginning of a luxurious career. One day I got to the point where groceries had lost its charm and I had to move on to bigger and better things. And what could be more rewarding than stealing cars? The only problem now was that I really couldn`t put the cars back after I had taken them. At first I felt kind of bad about this but once you steal your first car and drive off into the sunset the rush is so intense thatyou really don`t think of the consequences. I got to know a couple of jail-house regulars who could take the cars off my hands, that means that they buy them from me so you law obeying morons understand what I mean. This gave me a rather solid income and you could say that my every day life changed for the better. Its not usual for a 16 year old kid to walk around being able to buy whatever he feels like. People always asked me how I could buy all the stuff I did but I just said that the police salary is not as bad as one might think, and most people believed me. You may ask if I had lost my mind doing all these things. Of course I had some bad days where I nearly got caught and felt rather strange afterwards. Imagine being arrested by your own father. That has got to be one of the most humiliating experieces one can have. But to this very day I haven`t been arrested so the only worry I have is what to spend my money on. Crime does not pay? Huh. It has paid for my entire appartment and education. I have wooed so many girls by taking them to the most fancy places just because I ripped off a car the day before so don't come here and lecture me about moral. I just hope I don`t get caught by my old man. That`s all.....

NOUO1052,3.0,2.5,,,,,Most university degrees are theoretical and do not prepare students for the real world. They are therefore of very little value,"
Among all the carreer possibilities there are today, a huge number of young people choose the university as a place to achieve their knowledge.
It is discussed whether the universitites and its degrees are too theorethical. Questions have been raised about the university not being able to prepare the students for the real world, and that is a question I'm going to discuss in this essay.
The teaching metod used in the university differs from the education from secondary school by the fact that the lecturers are the active part, while the students are listening and taking notes. In secondary school the students are given the chance to be more active. Within some studies the university offers group lectures, however, but not within all.
I react to the fact that after one year of theorethical education, one is expected to show what one has learnt in more or less an 8 hour exam. The oral examinaton seems to me to be more of a test in how to tackle stress, or how to talk as fast as you can for 20 minutes, than a test in achieved knowledge.
I'm convinced that a system where hand ins count at the final result not only gives the student better marks, but also keep them active during their education. When it comes to the university degrees, I believe it's fully possible to leave the university with a degree, but with no practical knowledge. If you study to be a hair-dresser you'll learn how to deal with hair, but if you study at the university, you'll learn how to survive the exam. I feel that the only thing that counts is a mark on a piece of paper, not one's actual knowledge. In a way you're not finished after a degree, you're in lack of the practical part. In addition, it might not be easy to get a job, because employers often want employees with experience, and most often the experience you'll have as a cand.mag. etc., is work experience. After university you might have knowledge about certain subjests, but you have to turn to others than your lecturers to find out what to use the knowledge for.
Another issue linked to this is the fact that two persons can be called cand.mag., but they might have taken completely different subjects. The degree names appear to me to be just a status title. Personnally I'm more interested in knowing the actual subjects that a person have taken, rather than a title that indicates how many vekttall that person has achieved.
As I want to be a teacher, I agree that the university is too theotrethical. I now take my 3rd grunnfag in my cand.mag., but not once during my university education have I felt that ""this is something I can use in a class"". I wish I could be more prepared than I am going to be with one year of pedagogical education. I don't think that the lecturers want to leave out the practical part in the other subjects, but there is a limit both to time and money, as well as tradition attached to this question.

NOUO1053,3.5,3.5,,,,,"In his novel ""Animal Farm"" George Orwell wrote ""All men are equal but some are more equal than others"". How true is this today?","
In 1787, the so-called Founding Fathers wrote the American constitution. One of the main parts of this written contract between the people and the Government in the USA is the Bill of Rights. Shortly, this document, which was added to the constitution in 1791, declares the rights and liberties of the American people. They have the right to bear arms, to have a trial by jury in common law cases, to deny testifying and so on. But the most important issue in the Bill of Rights is the Americans right to freedom whether it comes to religion, speech, skin color, social -and cultural background etc. Now, almost every country has a kind of constitution that preserves the inhabitants. Therefore, in this case, America is only an example. To see the world, at least the modern part of it, under a whole in this case feels right. The trend seems to be the same all over; In spite of nice words about us taking care of each other and being equal, we group more than ever.
We like to see ourselves as tolerant. What we do not see is the fact that we group with those we feel we have most in common with. This is normal, because everyone has the need of belonging somewhere, be in a group with equals. But can we not be with equals without excluding others who might not 'fit in' perfectly? This leads to a split community where, of course, those with the strongest resources reach even higher up in the system.
Money is an important part in this game. The gap between rich and poor is growing bigger, and being wealthy is more important than ever. This is shown among adults as well as among youths and kids. In Norway, for example, the difference between the rich and the average Norwegian is huge. The rich people have a totally different lifestyle, which contains fame, publicity and luxury.
Among youths, a posh facade is very important. Expensive clothes are decisive, and you are expected to have enough money to go to cafes and restaurants almost every day. It is obvious that only a small part can afford this lifestyle, and those who can not, will not be able to keep up. Another thing is the difference between the talented ones and those who are not so gifted. Being smart has become more important, because this opens the opportunity to go to high prestige universities and colleges, and receiving a good education.
Religion and color are important factors. Now more than earlier, religious groups are very strict on who and what they can accept. If you do not have the same opinions as them, you may not be welcome. In some sects, the solidarity has had disastrous consequences, like suicides, brainwashing, pacts and so on.
Dark-skinned people are maybe the most exposed group when it comes to inacceptance. Recently, a fifteen-year-old boy was killed in Oslo because of his color. Luckily, this is not something the average Norwegian would do, and 40 000 people indicated their dislike in the Centrum of Oslo after this had happened. Still, not only in Norway, white-skinned people tend to fraternize and look down upon colored people. They surely are a group with inferiority complexes.
With today's ideal it is not too hard to see why the world has become what it is. You are supposed to look like a supermodel, have a great education, a happy family, a well-paid job and interesting and sophisticated friends. Everyone is struggling for their own surviving in a society that sets big demands. And when someone is not at all like that ideal, it is easy to look upon him or her as a person who has not succeeded.
After the great Winter Olympics at Lillehammer in 1994, Norway's Prime Minister of that time, Gro Harlem Brundtland, said: 'It is typical Norwegian to be good.' How can we learn to be tolerant and open-minded when even well known and high respected people say something like that? What she really meant was: 'we are all good, but we, the Norwegians, are better than everyone, we are The Best.' This is the thing we need to get rid of. We must stop thinking highly of ourselves and quit categorizing other people that we do not know.
It would have been a good start if we actually began to look at our fellows' inner values. Then we could say that we are tolerant.
If we could throw away our cynical and homogeneous way of thinking, we would soon become less prejudiced, and the world would quickly be a better place for everyone.

NOUO1055,4.0,3.0,,,,,"In his novel ""Animal Farm"" George Orwell wrote ""All men are equal but some are more equal than others"". How true is this today?","
In the novel Animal Farm, George Orwell dealt with the problems of discrimination, segregation and social Darwinism. Even though Orwell wrote his novel many years ago, the theme is still relevant even today. The world society is full of examples showing how discrimination of other people still occurs. Because of this frequency, I have, in this essay, chosen to put focus on the blacks' situation in the United States.
There is no doubt that if you look at the blacks' history, you will see that both the blacks' living conditions and their status as American citizens have improved dramatically. But taken into consideration what the blacks started as, and how slow the improvement actually has been, the picture is far less impressive. Even though the first blacks came centuries ago, blacks were not accepted as equal citizens, all rights included, until ""the rights revolution"" in the 1960's. In the years ahead of the 60's, there had been several attempts to improve the blacks' condition; both by black people themselves, but also by some more liberal whites. The problem however was that apparently improvements soon were outbalanced by some new and stricter segregation laws. The ""Jim Crow"" laws are just a few examples of this.
As I mentioned above, the blacks' situation has in fact improved. After school segregation was banned, black students have, as American citizens, had the same right to education as others. And many blacks have taken this opportunity to become highly qualified employees. Examples of their success is shown by the fact that many more have got prestigious jobs like doctors, lawyers and scientists. Statistics also show that more and more blacks are elected officials, including mayors in several cities. Perhaps the best example is manifested in Colin Powell, who recently became Secretary of State, appointed by George W. Bush.
This is however a paradoxical situation. Even though many blacks finally have fulfilled ""the American Dream"", and live their lives like ordinary citizens, for just as many, the situation is quite different. At the same time as many blacks have experienced an improvement both economically and socially, large portions of blacks have experienced a decline in these matters. The result has been a steadily growing black underclass.
Cities in the United states have ghettoes, and even though these ghettoes consist of different minority groups, in many of them the blacks make up an important element. The ghetto dwellers have little or no hope for the future, since practically none of them will get out of there. In addition to ghetto dwellers, there are also others who have economical problems, largely due to high unemployment. There are many blacks who are low-skilled and low-paid, and therefore become victims of an unstable job market. And it is probably at this point that discrimination still occurs. Methods like affirmative actions aiming for integration have proved to be less successful than expected or hoped for. Blacks are far from the only group which is being discriminated, but they make up a large percentage. Because of the fact that people are still being discriminated just because of the color of their skin, I think Orwell's quote still is very relevant.
I also want to mention another argument for why I consider the quote as true today. That is the fact that racism still exists among groups with a Nazi ideology. Nazism is growing in many Western countries, and the United States is no exception. These people openly show intolerance towards minority groups, with the blacks as one of them.
To sum up, I think I have been able to come up with at least some facts that show how George Orwell's famous quote still is of some relevance. With focus on the blacks in the United States, my argument is that despite of improvements, many black Americans still experience discrimination in areas such as the job market. This is a result of white people feeling superior to blacks. In addition, since open racism still occurs, there is no doubt that social Darwinism still functions as a living ideology.

NOUO1058,3.5,4.0,,,,,Most university degrees are theoretical and do not prepare students for the real world. They are therefore of very little value,"
When I first saw this statement I agreed totally. The university courses are only loads of books. At the exam one cannot support one self on material that is normally at use in a similar work situation. Students know what they should know, through intensive ""catch up"" reading, before their exam, but the forget it only days afterwards. After reading through the statement one more time my mind started to work.
The first thing I did was asking my self: What is the real world? There is no such thing as a real world. The world is locked upon with more than 12 billion different eyes. Then there cannot be ways of preparing for a job that are entirely right or wrong. For some the ""real world"" can be a job as a teacher, a professor at a university, or as an author. In each of these professions different skills are required, and most likely they do not use directly what they learned as students on a daily basis. Some things may newer come in use directly, but that does not mean that it is not used. Indirectly all off the things we once have learned stays with us, and form our way of thinking, and thereby how we work.
Another thing is this statements negative attitude towards theory. I do not think it is necessary to have practical assignments in every university subject. One could look at it in a different way: The university is where you learn the theory, and work is where you get to use your practical skills. A heavy theory background is often the best way of planning your practical moves, but it does not work the other way around. It would be impossible to start the ""real life"" without any luggage. The learning of theory is done the same way fore most people, but use of theory can come out in many different ways. To achieve progress in the world we have to shape equal knowledge into different shapes, not equal shapes out of different material.
Even if I am wrong in my presumptions about the use of theory in the different subjects at the university, I think I am right about on thing: Even if you never get to use all the theory you have learned, it has not been a waste, and most of all it, is not worthless. Who should have the right to tell what is of value and what is not? Everything you ever learn gives you, in one-way ore another, personal enrichment. If one were going to sum up all the things that directly have value in the so-called real world, I think the list would be surprisingly short. That is because we are all humans and not machines. Every little thing you have, that others do not, gives you an upper hand. This is also the case when it comes to your theoretical background.
There is not only one road that leads to the goal. You can do things the hard way, the easy way, the fun way, the slow way and so on. The main thing is that you reach the goals you have put up for yourself. Often the goal is wage and hard to see clearly. Your path is constantly changing, and at all the road turns you meet you have to choose, and choose away. This is also the way with education.

NOUO1072,3.0,3.5,,,,,Most university degrees are theoretical and do not prepare students for the real world. They are therefore of very little value,"
After having studied many years at the university I wanted to go out in the real world. I wanted to teach. I signed up for Practical Pedagogic Education, a one-year course, which would in addition to my previous university degree qualify me as a teacher. I went to all the lectures, read the curriculum, discussed it with other students and completed eight weeks of teaching under the guidance of a senior teacher. Then I went anxiously, ""well-prepared"" out in the real world, to a junior high school, to teach. It was a nightmare! I was not at all prepared for the challenges that followed after having attended all lectures and passed my exam in Practical Pedagogic Education. How does one catch teenagers' attention? How does one give clear messages? How does one argue for one's case in a debate with colleagues? etc. Some of these things had been mentioned in the lectures, but one doesn't really know how to handle practical matters if one hasn't made one's own experiences. It is all about trying and failing before you finally succeed.
This university degree was as theoretical as most of the other university degrees except for the eight weeks of teaching practice, which was more or less a guest-performance! The same traditional working-methods were used in this course as in most other university courses.
In most of the university courses students attend lectures and read the acquired reading. Most students also discuss relevant topics in smaller discussion groups. But the majority of time spent on studies, is spent on either lectures or individual reading. In the real world one has to know how to present a case, negotiate, argue for a case, make appropriate use of sources, organize information and cooperate among other things. By passivly receiving information in the lectures you don't get to practice these activities hence you'll not be prepared for the real world. After having studied around a year, one has to take the exams. In the exam one sits for a certain amount of hours equipped with a pencil only. The questions and one's answer to them will inform the examinators if one has read the curriculum or not. This situation is totally odd in comparison to the way things work in the real world. Thus, one can seek help from secondary sources and discuss the problem that has to be solved with colleagues. To organize the information and to make appropriate use of it, that's where the difficulty comes in.
Today as the labor market is due to constant changes, the university system has to be more flexible and make an effort to readjust its courses to be more student-centered and focused on the needs of the labor market. Students should as well have the opportunity to choose different paths within a course that would fit their occupational interests.
The university degrees of today are of value though. One is free to choose direction after having completed a university degree, which one isn't able to do in the same degree after having completed a vocational study. They prepare for either research or an occupation outside university campus. One isn't well enough prepared for an occupation in the real world with a university degree, but it forms the basis of any occupation within the field studied. Having a university degree also makes one feel theoretically secure and competent within one's field, which is the most important thing after all when making a start in the real world.

NOUO1073,4.0,2.0,,,,,"Some people say that in our modern world, dominated by science and technology and industrialisation, there is no longer a place for dreaming and imagination. What is your opinion?","
Some people say that in out modern world, dominated by science technology and industrialization, there is no longer a place for dreaming and imagination. In my opinion, this is not true. All people in all places at all times will always be dreaming and using their imagination. Developments, new knowledge and new skills will only open for new kinds of dreams.
In the beginning of our industrialized society, things moved slowly, and new discoveries didn't come very often. But one discovery led to another and opened new doors to knowledge on fields that down to that time had been out of our reach. As soon as we had figured out one ting we'd have found five new things to do research on. Development has only been gathering speed and things are happening faster than people would have even been able to imagine just a decade ago. Things that seemed impossible some years ago are things we take for granted today. This rapid increase in knowledge gives a lot of opportunities to people, and it's possible to believe in and dream of things that may seem impossible today. Who would have thought that computer science would be as big and important as it is today, only twenty years ago? This feeling of being able to do almost anything, gives people courage to dream!
Some people may argue that we know so much that it's killing people's dreams. But the more we figure out and understand, the more we have to admit that we do not understand and don't know how to figure out. This fact also forces people to use their imagination to try and figure out new and alternative solutions to old, unsolved problems.
But also society is changing. Old differences between groups of people are fading away and new groups and differences are created. New doors are opening to new groups of people. Many are getting opportunities they never had before, and people are able to live their lives closer to their ideal life. And more freedom creates more dreams.
We live in a busy world. People work long hours and are hurrying from place to place, from one meeting to another. Do we actually have time for dreaming? Of course we do. Dreams are there all the time, popping into our heads when we least expect it. A dream doesn't need to be very big; it's not necessarily a dream of changing the world. It could be a much smaller dream. About getting a dog, visiting a place far away, learning to play tennis or to apply for a new job.
The picture painted in this essay isn't very nuanced. A lot of people will never benefit from all this new knowledge and development. Maybe they won't even know that it exists. But still they'll have dreams and they will use their imagination. For people will always be dreaming. They will always try to reach a bit further, and will always imagine what life could have been like if only...
Some people may say that there is no longer a place for dreaming and imagination. But I think they're wrong. There's always such a place. And that place is found in people's mind.

NOUO1074,3.0,4.0,,,,,Most university degrees are theoretical and do not prepare students for the real world. They are therefore of very little value,"
Let us consider some of the reasons one might have for stating such a claim. It is true that universities offer highly theoretical education, e.i. lectures, and sometimes smaller groups. These lectures and groups come to maybe 10-15 hours a week. In addition it is required that students study on their own, e.i. that they read, read, read! Some students may form discussion groups, which is advisable, but none the less no more non theoretical than the other forms of education mentioned. The statement above, therefore, seems easy to agree with.
Is a university degree of less value than degrees from other educational institutions, like the norwegian hgskole? At hgskolen it is common to combine theoretical education, lectures, with a fair amount of practice at a relevant place of work. Students from hgskolen may thus be better prepared for ""the real world"". But I would argue that for a dedicated student it need not be a problem that the university degree is theoretical, they will most certainly adjust to the practical side of their studies once they start working.
One of the reasons most of the education at universities are purely theoretical may be that the students are free to choose their own combinations of subject to a much larger extent than at e.g. hgskolen. Because the combinations of subjects vary so much one would have to ""tailor-make"" some sort of practice for each student. And this is, of course, not an easy job.
It should be mentioned here that the degrees directed towards a particular occupation, e.g. the study of medicine or psychology, do in fact have plenty of practice.
One may conclude that a university-type education does not suit all students. It may be more valuable for well-disciplined students. Students who at own initiative seek out places they can practice what they are being taught. By e.g. taking side jobs or joining organizations related to their studies. There is also the possibility of taking one semester of your degree at a desired place of work. This is a fairly new arrangement that enables students to get a ""real world"" working experience. One should perhaps increase information about, and encourage the students to take better use of, the possibilities offered.
Students at universities are mostly left to themselves to decide how to study. With no obligatory lectures or homework it takes a lot of discipline to keep up the good work all through the semester. It may seem that this is because of the theoretical form of education, when it may be just lack of determination that leads to a degree of little value. The students need to realize that they must take an active part in forming their own education. I have myself studied at both university and hgskole and, seen from the perspective of me being prepared for the real world, I value my university education more.

NOUO1075,3.5,4.0,,,,,Crime does not pay,"
Does crime pay? I do not think so, even though some may say that it is too easy to get away with criminal behaviour in Norway. Some even argument that the few that actually get caught is treated too nice and that they often get a punishment that does not harmonize with the crime they have committed. Many people are also provoked by the fact that a lot of prisoners are placed in single rooms, with their own television, computer and their own private bathrooms... Well, it might be true that the system of punishment is a bit too little deterring in Norway, but even if that is the truth I would say that crime does not pay.
Even though a criminal person might not have been caught and punished for his or her actions, I believe that such an action does something with you as a person. In my opinion you lose an essential part of yourself when you make a choice to live a life on the wrong side of the law. And that part will be really hard to get back if you should ever regret your actions.
It is also true that in most cases the benefit you will get from your criminal actions only will last for a short period of time and that a minor offence often will lead you to commit more serious crimes in the future, crimes that it might be harder for you to get away with. Research has shown that it is easier for those already convicted to do crimes again.
But, I believe that the hardest punishment of all for one that has committed a crime is the way that the rest of the society will look upon you if you get caught. Social condemnation can ruin a person just as much, if not even more, than the punishment given by the authorities. Not only will you meet reactions from your own family and your neighbours, the man in the street might even prejudge you.
Most of all I believe that if you compare the benefits you will get from committing a crime with what you will have to sacrifice in order to get them, you will find that it is a huge prize to pay and that the choices you take in such a situation will change your life forever. And, if you get caught, you will have problems to maintain a normal family life even after you have served your sentence. It might be difficult to get a normal job, to establish a family of your own and to get loans and other official papers in order.
My point then, is that if you have committed a crime, no matter if you get caught or not, it changes you as a person for the rest of your life and in my opinion that in it self is a far too huge prize to pay, regardless of the benefits you might get if you ""succeed"" in your actions. In other words, crime does not pay!

NOUO1078,4.0,3.0,,,,,All armies should consist entirely of professional soldiers: there is no value in a system of military service,"
The purpose for any good essay is to view things from different perspective. However, with something as wrong as military service, there are difficulties for me in finding any good sides about it. In fact, the entire basis for military service is not only wrong, but also against most people's sense and moral.
First, the idea of military service is in itself indefensible. It is generally agreed upon that most of the parts of military service are unheard of. The ""duty"" of young men to perform military service is unacceptable on the grounds that involuntary service is forced upon their persons. Military service is therefore nothing but forced labour, which again is all but slavery. Slavery might seem exaggerated, however it is in reality not. Although there are no whips or chains, there are many orders to follow, several new laws and restrictions on where to go in one's spare time. The compensation for the loss of income is ridiculously low and often goes back to the Government because most of the money ends up in their cantinas after the free dinner has been presented in the mess hall.
Also, the chances for not being ordered into this work camp are relative small. The idea is that anyone who is fit, but does not feel comfortable using weapons and in other ways be trained to kill, is excused, and will do civil service rather than military. In praxis, this does not occur too often. The demands are that the person in a total pacifist, who would not in any case use violence. Political or other reasons, except for physical, are often ignored, and refusal to participate is met with imprisonment.
There are two normal arguments for Military service: that it educates the boys and that it is the duty of the inhabitants (i.e. young men (?)) to fight for their land. The first argument is easy to fight back. After nine years or more of school, further involuntary education should strictly not be necessary. The second one is not much more difficult. Why is it the duty of the inhabitants? Is it the duty of the inhabitants because they are inhabitants and must fight for the freedom and the will of the nation?
In that case, one might consider the following puzzle: Should young men be ordered to fight for the system that brought them in the army? Then they will probably fight for a system they no longer believe in. If they fight because of sense of duty rather than conviction, we are forced to realize that they fight for a system that is doing just that; ordering people to fight against their principles.
The second reason is that we could do better. An army is a necessary evil, one that one cannot do without. An army is needed to defend the country, and an army should therefore be kept as good as possible to defend the beliefs and the culture the nation stands for. That cannot be done well enough with a loose group of young men who are not necessarily ready to fight, and of whom many have a strong dislike to the system that brought them in.
A professional army would to a much better job. They are there to do a job, and they are there to do it well. They wish to be good soldiers; they will have no moral issues about being in the army and they will not try to sabotage the moral of the soldiers. But can we afford them? There must be a reduction in the number of soldiers, of course, however, one soldier who knows what he or she does is worth at least ten who wave no clue. Besides, every soldier who is serving in Norway cost approximately between  10 000 and  100 000 to train. Any professional who serves more than a year will therefore be less expensive than training another involuntary soldier, since he does not need to be trained again.

NOUO1083,3.0,2.0,,,,,Most university degrees are theoretical and do not prepare students for the real world. They are therefore of very little value,"
This is a view of university education, that many people, righteous or not, tend to have. And most students have more than once questioned the value of sitting passively in the auditorium, listening to The Professor talking about something (almost) never mentioned outside the campus, only to procede to the reading room to sit there(passively?) for a couple of hours.The theoretical approach in University, can easily be seen as inadequate for coping with careers in the real world. This approach can be argued to be theoretical both in manner and content , that is the way it is taught and what is being taught.A student can stay quite anonymous if he/she wants to.There is no required attendance in smaller groups, so that working in groups can easily be avoided.The social abilities don't really have to be challenged.Another problem is the lack of focus on up-to date, concrete issues and problems, and of really facing and solving them.Maybe it can be called a kind of knowing what, but not how.
But the fact is luckily more nuanced than this.The value of any kind of education , in meeting the real world, depends upon what will be your occupation in it. It depends upon the student and his/hers abilities and efforts to extract the experience and learning actually present in the educational process. And of course, it's also important who the individual lecturers are,and what subject is being studied.
But, when it comes to questioning the value of a university degree, this will come more to its right if the focus is on the individual development: The (hoped for) wakening up of our consciousness, our curiosity, our critical abilities and not least the shapening of flexible minds. Through facing ancient questions, diving into the past to see the present, and reading the words of those who knew/know the art of conveying, we are hopefully at least given a stepping stone for our own individual development. And this will normally be tried out in the students own contributions through assignments. Also, whatever you study, you have to learn how to gain this knowledge, how to navigate in the mass of information surrounding you as a student. And this is not given you by spoonfulls, this has to be aquired through own effort, in the same way as later on in the real world.
There are for sure important qualities to gain from university studies. Still, are they sufficient and satisfactory, considering what they could have been, if providing a more practical and contemporary approach, along with the present inclination? No doubt, students would win a lot through a closer cooperation with both co-students and lecturers. Also, it would be valuable and inspiring going to other sources than mainly texts and other people's discoverings( which also now often is referred to as backgrounds, now ""out of date"").
Clearly changes for the better could be introduced in university education, to prepare students for their careers. But a crucial point has to be made about the nature of this type of education: Many of the students choosing it, do so presicely because it doesn't lead directly to any particular career. This is a fact effecting the type of education found in this institution. But even so, the need of flexibility does not require hours of one-way conversation in an auditorium as its method.

NOUO1086,3.5,3.0,,,,,All armies should consist entirely of professional soldiers: there is no value in a system of military service,"
Should all armies consist entirely of professional soldiers? Is there no value in a system of military service?
These are the questions I will be discussing in this essay. Since I am Norwegian, I will consentrate on the Norwegian system.
At the age of 18 all boys are called up into the army. Only those with bad health are ""spared"". Those who are against war and weapons are also ""spared"", but they have to do civil service for 15 months instead.
It is a quite wellknown thing that most boys are not too glad to go into the military. You hear stories of how soldiers do all they can not to do hard work and also how they fool their officers. If things like this happen during real war time, it can lead to serious problems, and that is one of the arguments in favour of letting only professional soldiers defend the country. What a national defence does in wartime is of course very important, so it must be better having soldiers who care, who are interested and who have proper knowledge and education to do this. Some claim that the soldiers' bad attitudes will change to the better when things get real, but that is not easy to say.
If we in Norway change our system into an entirely professional system, there is one big problem however, will there be enough soldiers actually wanting to do this for a living? We might be too few.
Another aspect of this are all the jobs the Norwegian soldiers do in peace time. For instans during and after big accidents and natural disasters. The professional soldiers would probably not be too interested in doing things like that, when they are educated to defend a country. So, who would do this then? And if the professionals agreed to do it, would the number of soldiers be high enough?
Some claim also that 18 year old boys need this almost obligatory year simply to grow up. This year also gives the boys more oppurtunities to choose from when they choose careers. A lot of boys and men choose a military education which is paid for, so this is actually a quite economic thing to do. And if they pass the exams, they are in duty bound to work in the military for 3 years, in other words, they are guarantied a job.
During the military service the soldiers recive a symbolic amount of money per day. An amount that should cover their necessary expenses as long as they don't have an enormous consum. And when they dismiss they recive a larger amount to prevent that they are broke when they are ""on their own"" again.
If a potential soldier really wants to start on a university or college immidiatly after high-school, it is not a big problem postponing the military service. And if you ""interrupt"" your education with a year in the army, your ""studieln"" will be freezed for the period you are in the service. On top of that, if you have rented an appartment for more than 3 months before you are called up into the military, they pay the rent for you!
Although it is almost impossible to say which option is better, the professional or the traditional system, I claim the things mentioned above sets today's system in favour of the professional, at least in a small country like Norway. We must also take into consideration the great changes the whole system must go through changing from one to the other. It might end up not being worth a change after all.

NOUO1087,3.5,,,,,,"In his novel ""Animal Farm"" George Orwell wrote ""All men are equal but some are more equal than others"". How true is this today?","
Taking a startingpoint in contemporary Norway it seems right to say that all men are equal. At least that is what we like telling ourselves. But if it is investigated further one would probably find that some are thought to be more equal than others.
Women's liberation has come a long way, still one cannot say that boys and girls, men and women are completely equal. Some jobs are for men only, and sometimes men get better wages than women. It is important to remember, though, that there are also jobs and opportunities that are for women only. It works both ways. The difference between men and women is so fundamental that even though they are equal they cannot be treated exactly the same and get all the same opportunities.
Something which seems more unfair, is the treatment of homosexuals. I believe adult Norwegians look upon gays and lesbians as equal to themselves up to a certain point, but yet not quite equal because they have a different lifestyle. This, of course, is generally speaking.
According to recent events in Norway, I can safely say that many people in Norway think Norwegians are more equal than immigrants, especially those who have a different skin-colour. Racism is one of the clearest and worst examples of giving some people less value.
Most Norwegians and our politicians say they are against all racism, which is a good thing. But although this is the attitude outwards it might not always be the case. I am not trying to say that all Norwegians are racists, but exactly the feeling that some are more equal than others gives racism a chance to grow. The fact that a political party such as the FrP, with their radical politics towards immigrants and foreigners, can get so many supporters and so much influence in Norway shows that racism does exist. Being a racist is not equivalent to organisations and violence, a frown or a comment is all it takes.
The 'everyday-racism' is very much in the spotlight in Norway these days. A group of Nazis is arrested for the murder of a fifteen year-old boy. Many claim that groups like that could not exist if racism did not exist, that Norwegians by their semi-racism allow extreme groups like Nazis to develop. Unintentionally, of course, but still it is a frightening thought. As a reaction to this murder 40 000 people marched in Oslo against Nazism and all racism. Perhaps what we were saying was that the Nazis are not as equal as us.
I have tried to link the problem with feeling better than others to gender, sexual orientation and ethisity. Age is also a matter which creates inequality. Children and adults do not have the same rights, but the explanation for that is biological and most often unproblematic.
For less biological reasons people judge equality based on income, many places in the world there is a big difference between the rich and the poor. It might be easy for rich people to think of their peers as equal and those with less money as less equal. Many people have the mentality that if you are poor, you just have not worked hard enough. And vice versa, some poor people might think of the rich as spoiled by their money, and less equal to them as human beings.
This is a very black and white picture, although the problem is quite complex, if it is a problem at all. I may have taken wrong assumptions, but I am sure, though, that many people today think exactly what George Orwell wrote in Animal Farm 'All men are equal: but some are more equal than others.'

NOUO1094,2.5,,,,,,Feminists have done more harm to the cause of women than good,"
After reading the statement above I was puzzled as to how I would approach the problem and a little curious to know in what context that person uttered such a statement. My next problem concerned how I would analyze what s/he was referring to at the time.
When I looked up the word feminism in my dictionary I fond that feminism is ""the advocacy of women's rights on the grounds of sexual equality"". But the quation above does not refer to feminism per definition but to feminists, people who supposedly fight for feminism. Hence , I think the problem the person wants to address is what we in retrospect can see as a consequence of feminist ""extemity"", that culminated in the 1970s. At the late sixties and early seventies society in the western world seemed ready for an open discussion on the issue of women and their traditional roles as mother, wife and housekeeper. This was due to changes in the political climate and society as a whole. Women began to group themselves in organisations such as Women's Liberation. This happened especially in relation to the hippie movement and other young radical groups who were prominent in society and forced people to hear their message. The ""extremism"" of certain feminist organisations was only a necessary rebellion against what was felt as supression and degeneration of women that had been going on far too long.In my humble opinion, I believe this was an inevitablereaction to an existing androcentric world both in academic circles, the working place and the domestic sphere. Many women felt they were both marginalized and invisible as both subjects and objects, especially in academic studies. And they called for a feminist critical consciousness. In retrospect there has been a tendency to point to the reprocutions of the feminist movement. People claim it has broken up homes. They see the high divorce rate as a direct consequence of women's liberation. Also , the fact that women started to work outside the home and the children have been left in daycare are highly debated. Some members of society,expecially christian right oriented groups, blame women's liberation for legalising abortion, and see pro-choice activists as an abomination. The see women's lib. activities as devastating to the cause of women,since motherhood should be a woman's first priority. Other people praise feminists and feminism, asserting that without it women would still be unjustly reduced to an existence inside the home. In contemporary society, people seems tired of the whole subject matter of female versus male. There has been a shift in focuse away from women and on to gender,which concerns itself with man and woman in mutual interdependence. This is especially recognisable in academic studies. Contemporary women's studies does now presuppose a twentieth-century (twentyfirst- century) holistic anthropology. Here the human being is defined as sexually differentiated. It is not longer split into male or female body and a sexless, rational soul. Women studies make a clear distinction between sex as biologically determined and gender as culturally constructed.
The utterance ""Feminists have done more harm than good to the cause of women"" has very little ot no relevance at this time in history. It is a new millenium and people are generally no longer interested in the dichotomy women and men. We are all a human entity and the cause of women is outdated. We are now looking at the cause of mankind.

NOUO1096,1.5,1.0,,,,,The prison system is outdated. No civilized society should punish its criminals: it should rehabilitate them,"
This is a thesis that I don't really agree with, and I shall try to explain the reason in the following lines:
I believe in Norway the judicial system is far too lenient with sentence giving.
I think that criminal offences should not be tolerated, and that people should be punished for their crimes.
Punishment should stand as a penance so people will consider not committing them again. The more serious the crime, the harder the punishment.
I truly believe that people need to be corrected if they hurt other people or their property.
The prisons are also costing society a substantial amount of money, I think we should find other ways of punishing offenders whilst also making it more cost efficient.
In a country like Norway, there is a lot of focus on rehabilitating criminals. So many resources are put into trying to make offenders see sense and become law abiding citizens, but in most cases there is a large percentage that upon returning to society after serving their sentence fall back into the same line of easy money, drugs and harmful action as as before they were put in prison.
Millions is spent on educating, feeding and past-time activities in the prisons.
They have private ensuite rooms, they get to have a television there as well. Even pocket money and the privilege to smoke tobacco is extended to these offenders that have seriously hurt people directly or indirectly.
It is more like a holiday resort, though many will object saying that you lose your freedom being locked up.
Of course you lose your freedom, but that's the only thing you do lose, and that is where I believe the way of thinking should be changed.
When you commit an offence and the Court decides that you shall serve a prison sentence, you shall be dreading it.
There should be bad food served in the kitchens, you shall make it yourself and you should only have a few basic ingredients.
There should be a toilet and cleaning facilities but these should be shared and cleaned by the inmates themselves.
No personal items should be allowed, and communication apparatuses are banned.
People should dread going to prison, ofcourse no physical or mental harm shall befall the inmates but it should be an environment of solitude.
If people cannot adapt to the minimum of rules and regulation in a society then they should be kept away from it but not at great expense to taxpayers.
These are my views of how we should deal with offenders, ofcourse the severity of the offences plays an important role of how harshly we shall deal with them, but enough of this pedagocical nonsense!
( Not everything expressed in this essay are my personal beliefs, but my old Norwegian teacher said that not everything in an essay has to be true .... Sometimes it just makes a good story.)

NOUO1097,2.0,3.0,,,,,Most university degrees are theoretical and do not prepare students for the real world. They are therefore of very little value,"
This actually is a rather contentious issue for me. The reason being I've now begun studying again, but this time I'm doing subjects which I feel will be relevant for my future career. And yet I don't really feel I need the qualifications. I'll always be able to teach English even if I haven't done English 'grunnfag' and a year of pedagogical training. I know as much because I've spent time teaching; I've been told I do it well (or well enough at least) and on the courses I hold at 'Aftenskolen' I have pupils coming back for more. My employer has told me she uses me as much as possible. So clearly you don't need years of education and exams to be a good teacher. You don't really need to know the kinds of things that are taught on the courses - like for instance the fact that the 'b' sound is a 'bilabial plosive'. What senior school kid is going to want to know that?
And what about the litterature we study? Is it necessary for me to know what other critics and academics have written about 'Paradise Lost' by J. Milton or 'The Awakening' by K. Chopin? All I'm doing (to a large exent) is regurgitating stuff that has been said a million different times before in hundreds of different textbooks. You don't need a University degree to enjoy a play like 'The Glass Menagerie' or a book like 'Hunger'. (A novel written by someone who never studied at University).
So why do we do it? Why do we keep studying, taking exams as if our lives depended on it? Why indeed am I doing it?
Hm... That's a really good question really...
... Well... a simple answer to that ( and a rather cynical one) is that I need it to get a permanent job. I don't want to stay a substitute for the rest of my life. That means I need the qualifications in black and white. It won't do just to have the practical ability - you need the theoretical qualifications as well.
But it's not as simple as that. After all, some things do stick inside you if you take all these exams - and a lot of it, I believe, is for the better.
Clearly I'm studying something that is very relevant for the kind of career I'm thinking about. And that's important. I'll be able to convert some of the stuff I learn into real practical ability. If some things are a bit esoteric then it just means that I can forget about it after the exams, though of course things might change. What I think of as useless today might one day become very useful to know. And since I once studied phonetics, say, I'll be able to teach a class something about that as well...
And sudying the literature of different ages and what critics and other academics have said about the works over the past hundred years or so, will also give me an insight into these works. I'll know why these writers and artists wrote about the things they did and in the particular way they did. For some reason I actually enjoy knowing these things, and consider it important. Probably because it's part of my identity, which obviously matters a lot.
In a way it's easy to sneer at education. There probably is too much of it at the moment, creating divisions and strife between those people who can and want to study and those people who become tired and bored by words on a printed page. But what would happen if we scrapped University education altogether? Decided that because most ot it is theoretical and impractical we could manage without it.
That, surely, would not be a good thing. Because whether we like it or not, education does shape us. It provides you with insights into the world and the people that make it up. It gives you the right tools to analyse problems and to take actions to avoid the worst pitfalls.
It's not that those people who never go to University don't acquire these tools, but I think they would agree it's a privilege to know what theories do exist about the different professions - whether it be engineering, nursing, teaching, management, and so on.
So a degree isn't necessarily the answer to all your prayers, but if you're capable of converting what you were taught into something of practical value, then you've achieved something. They can't tell you how to do that at University - they don't even tell you that that's what you should do - but if they manage, then the luckier you are for it!

NOUO2003,3.5,3.0,,,,,"Some people say that in our modern world, dominated by science and technology and industrialisation, there is no longer a place for dreaming and imagination. What is your opinion?","
The claim that there is no longer a place for dreaming and imagination because our modern world is dominated by science, technology and industrialisation is, in my opinion, downright stupid. I also think that such a claim reveals a sense of nostalgia I think has little or no relevance to the genres, or professions if you like, which best express contemporary thought and ideas, namely literature, music and arts. In this essay I will try to elaborate on a few point in order to explain my view.
Frankly, I find the claim hard to grasp. Do humans dream less because of the invention of the microchip? Has our imagination diminished because we can now read books on the Internet? I think the claim could be narrowed down to ""evolution kills imagination"". Considering that humans still possess imagination, I feel tempted to point out the obvious: Human culture has evolved since the beginning. When did science and technology stop us from dreaming? Was it the invention of the lightbulb that killed our imagination? Rhetorical questions aside, here is my point: When one speaks of dreaming and imagination, then this nostalgia, this longing for the past, should be seen as much more dangerous than science and imagination. These are all traits that go hand in hand, and they are distinctly human. In fact, a modern world dominated by science and machines gives way to new dreams and new ways of thinking. Science fiction can be seen as an example of this, and so can electronic music. I have the feeling that someone capable of declaring that science and technology leaves no space for imagination, might not be the biggest Sci-fi nut.
Modern techniques such as photo rendering and computer graphics are new tools available to the modern artist. Sampling and the use of computers have become essentials in creating various forms of modern music, and writers of all kinds now use word processing. Modern technology can not only be a tool easing the creative prosess, it can also make new forms of creativity possible. Some critics argue that the use of modern tools such as computers often results in inferior quality. To that I can only say that the artist has the sole responsibility. It should be fairly obvious that the choice of tools directly influences the creative process. Some even argue that musicians should not need to go to school to develop a high level of proficiency on their instruments. They fear that schooling takes away the individual character of an up-and-coming musician. In response to such fears I quote the renowned guitarist Bill Frisell: ""It's only the players' fault if they let themselves be programmed by the routines that these places establish."" He continues: ""For example, in the harmony classes at Berklee, they'd have 'avoid notes', notes you weren't supposed to use over a particular chord. Naturally, those were the first ones I'd check out."" (Guitar Player, July 1992) I think the combined output of all contemporary artistic activity is a clear indicator of the state of mankind. Many argue that this is precisely the job of an artist; to mirror contemporary ideas and thoughts in all its shapes.
Industrialisation and new technology inevitably shapes our daily life and the world around us, hence it also influences the way we think and the way we dream. Invention and progress should be seen as assets, not burdens, of living in modern times. I think a key point in this discussion is whether the comforts of modern life, with all its impressive gadgets and its focus on effectiveness, leaves us with more spare time to dream or not. I believe that is often the case, and if not, one should reconsider the ways in which the fruits of modern times are employed. The responsibility of an action is that of the performer, not the tool. Thanks to word processing, I have been able to spend more time elaborating on this essay than actually writing it.

NOUO2005,3.5,3.0,,,,,The prison system is outdated. No civilized society should punish its criminals: it should rehabilitate them,"
All societies have rules, and whoever breaks these will, if detected, in most cases be punished in some way or other. The rules excist partly to protect the citizens and create stability. A widely used form of punishment with very long traditions, is prison; the removal of a person's most basic right, freedom, for longer or shorter periods. The goal has often not only been to simply punish criminals, but also to protect lawful citizents, to prevent others from attempting to breaking laws, and not least to make sure the offender does not repeat his actions. Some people, though, consider imprisonment to be an outdated feature of society, and that one should instead make it one's prime object to rehabilitate the offenders.
Most people will admit that prison is not an ideal response to crime. It is expensive to feed and lodge an ever growing number of people in a secure environment. Additionally, the prisons are often crowded and violent, and drugs are easily available. The prisoners socialise with other criminals, have practically no contact with ordinary society, and will all too often when released return to their former lives. This forms an evil circle not only destructive for the individual, but also for society on a whole.
The problem is to find a suitable alternative. Rehabilitation is arguably the most popular idea, although some doubt if it is actually possible. Statistics showing the disturbingly high number of criminals who repeatedly break the law may be seen to indicate this, and the children of convicts often become criminals themselves. This pattern was formerly seen as a result of genetics, criminal behaviour being hereditary. Now, however, milieu is widely considered to be responsible. Releaving the individual of some guilt, by blaiming society. Still, to change one's way of life is not easy, and convicted criminals are ordinarily stigmatized by the rest of the community, leaving them with very few choices. It is only too easy to return to an undesirable environment.
The baseline is that the criminals need help. Especially Christian organisations, who believe that only God can really separate good from evil, and teach mercy and forgiveness, and socialist and humanitarian groups, emphasising the immessurable worth of man, have eagerly endorsed rehabilitation. Others are oppose the idea of spending hugh amount of government funds on such projects, the results of which in the past have proved not quite as efficient and successful as one might have hoped. The latter has also argued that this would be a kind of reward for the offenders. They would end up, or so is the goal, leading better lives, whereas the victims would be the ones to suffer, punished in other words. Surely this in it self would have no crime preventative effect, and yet more money would have to be spent to acheive this in other ways. To which extent prison it self has any preventative effect has also been discussed.
Moreover, one cannot ignore the passionate desire people seem to have to punish criminal offenders, nor the appearant satisfaction when finding someone to blame. This might be one reason why prison and other ways of punishment seem more appealing to most people than the rehabilitation. Prison is familiar and it keeps the criminals, at least for some time, out of one's own neighbourhood. Some argue that they deserve what ever problems await them inside or after being released. Others that the extra resources, both man power and funds, that would be the long term result of an efficient rehabilitation program, would benefit the society as a whole. An institution such as prison, being very much alive and widely supported, can hardly be said to be outdated. Wheather or not it is desirable or morally right or wrong, is a wholly different matter.

NOUO2006,3.0,2.0,,,,,Feminists have done more harm to the cause of women than good,"
Christine de Pizan, wrote in 1404 the earliest modern chronicles of lives of great women of the past. She hoped to bring them ""out of the ignorance which so blinds your own intellect"". Throughout history of mankind, the stories have been told and involved solemnly males. No wonder some women feel it hard to identify them selves with the past. Ten years ago students in high school and college history classes could examine the index of their history survey texts and come to the conclusion that there are hardly any stories about great women. Due to the feminist movement, lot of this has changed.
Feminism started mildly in the beginning of the 20th century. At that time, issues like slavery, civil rights, politics and freedom of speech were getting more commonly debated. The life of a woman would in many cases not be that different from a slave. She was inferior to a man, and was therefore his to command.
After the two World Wars, women proved that they were a lot more capable than expected. They showed the men that they were not only good at taking care of the house and children, but also at working, which they never had had the chance to prove before.
Feminists during the 50`s and 60`s were very liberal, and the changes that took place were quite extreme. Throughout the (democratic) world, the role of the so-called woman, were in great changes. The ""housewife"" for a man was no longer the primary role, and they were now concentrating more on getting jobs, and providing independence and security for themselves.
What is a great change for some might be devastation for others. Many men, but also women, oppose feminists. The anti-feminists feel that the movement is a threat to family values, and an assault on familiar patterns that provide security, identity and meaning. Some also say that feminists are too extreme, and that they are trying to retaliate, because of the injustice they have had in the past. Some of them even claim that: ""God is now a woman"".
In many cases the feminists have done a lot of good. They have opened up womens`health clinics, rape crisis centres, better treatment by hospital, police and court staff, and among other things, better wages. Then on the other hand, you have now shared household. In addition to having a full-time job, they also have more or less the same responsibilities in the home, meaning double work for the same pay, because the husband and children are only ""helping out"". There has also been an increase of single mothers, and abortions.
There is no easy answer to whether the feminist have done more harm than good. Some enjoy being the traditional housewife and mother, while others don't. Sigmund Freud once said that a woman's nature was determined by biology. Little did he know how far a woman's nature has evolved since that time, or has it.....?

NOUO2007,3.0,,,,,,The prison system is outdated. No civilized society should punish its criminals: it should rehabilitate them,"
The theme of my essay is the statement, "" the prison system is outdated. No civilized society should punish its criminals: it should rehabilitate them.""
The prison system is an old system of punishment, and it is very widely used in the world today. This system is by many people regarded as an effective way of dealing with criminals. It is said to prevent the criminal from committing new crimes, and also serves as an example so that it prevents others from committing crimes. Whether or not imprisonment actually has these two effects, is a matter of discussion.
An alternative system of dealing with criminals is rehabilitation. Defenders of rehabilitation argue that one must see the individual who has committed the crime, and try to help him/her so that this person will be able to function in society. Their view on criminal justice is that it is society's job to rehabilitate them. This view is linked with the philosophical question of the "" free will"". The question is to what extent are these people destined to becoming criminal? The two factors that may determine this are, the criminal's social backgrounds and their personality. Defenders of rehabilitation claim that society owes these people a sort of compensation, or at least help to get them on the right track. Their theory is that criminals need psychological, pedagogical, and possibly medical help, not punishment.
In order to defend rehabilitation, one must consider whether rehabilitation has a better effect on the criminal than punishment. One must assume that the main goal of rehabilitation is that the criminal does not commit new crimes.
From my point of view, rehabilitation may have some effect on the criminal depending on three things, the age of the criminal, the type of crime, and the criminals motivation. For example, it is not very likely that rehabilitation will work on a criminal who has committed crimes over and over again. The type of crime is also of importance, the graver the crime, the more probable that the criminal needs some sort of treatment. Lastly, it is hard to believe that rehabilitation will work on a criminal who isn't motivated. Treatment usually depends on cooperation
There is also another aspect to the discussion around rehabilitation vs. imprisonment, and that is the consideration of the victim. The victim is the person who has been offended by the crime. Rehabilitation of the criminal instead of punishment may seem unfair and insulting to the victim. Most victims want the criminal punished to restore the balance. Society's need of seeing the criminal punished can not be fulfilled with rehabilitation.
As mentioned earlier in my essay, prison is not only meant to keep criminals from committing new crimes, but it is also supposed to keep others from committing crimes, in fear of being punished. If a potential criminal does not risk anything except rehabilitation, he may be more apt to committing a crime. Defenders of rehabilitation may argue that the fear of punishment will not stop a potential criminal who is already predestined to becoming a criminal. It also depends on the crime. A thief may think about the consequences of his action, while a jealous husband killing his wife in a rage may not, because of the crime's character.
My conclusion is that criminal justice based solely on rehabilitation seems very unlikely today. Yet imprisonment without any form of rehabilitation doesn't seem too wise either. An ideal solution must be a combination of the two. In this way the criminal receives his punishment, and at the same time he gets help to function better in society after coming out of prison.

NOUO2010,4.0,3.0,,,,,"In his novel ""Animal Farm"" George Orwell wrote ""All men are equal but some are more equal than others"". How true is this today?","
""All men are equal; but some are more equal than others."" This quotation is taken from the masterly written novel ""Animal Farm"" by George Orwell. As an immediate association to a saying like this, we think of things such as slavery, apartheid and the era before the civil rights came along. Clearly, such a statement does not belong in our tolerant, modern society, it is not a phenomenon of our time. Still, every now and again, things pop out into the open, indicating that we might be wrong. Like a bell that rings in the back of our heads, something happens and makes us aware of the shadow in our enlightened world. What happened in the ocean outside of Australia in august, is precisely such a thing.
A ship called ""Tampa"" rescues over 400 refugees from drowning outside of Australia. All of the refugees have the same dream; a new and better existence in a free society with opportunity for all. That dream is shattered. Australian authorities do not allow these exhausted, frightened and ill people ashore. They are illegal immigrants. They are Asian. This opens the eyes of the world.
""All men are equal"", we say, as like a matter of course. All men are equal in Australia too, yet some are more equal than others. Basically, many would say, this orwellian way of thinking is the reason why Australia` s Prime minister John Howard refused the boat refugees entrance to the country. A nation which, ironically, consists mainly of people whose ancestors were immigrants themselves, coming from Britain or elsewhere in Europe, oppressing the native inhabitants and claiming their right to the new land. They looked upon themselves as superior to the natives, or ""Australian Negroes"" as they called them. Unfortunately, this feeling of superiority does still exist. Today, surprisingly as it may seem, we find a want for a white Australia. John Howard was aware of this.
The dream of a white Australia is to be found among the nation` s citizens, no less in the year of 2001. As to avoid confrontation with the people who believe in this, John Howard put the world` s opinion of Australia at risk. Experts claim that the Prime minister would not have taken such a decision unless he knew he had people within the nation who would stand behind him. People who shared his dream.
The roots of this dream are to be traced all the way back to the 1860s, when official politics went under the name of "" The White Australian Policy "". The Australian Natives, the Aborigines, finally got their civil rights about one hundred years later. Now, people considered these descending thoughts to be dead and gone. Obviously, they were wrong.
Today, there are people who look proudly upon the time of ""The White Australian Policy"", and Pauline Hanson is one of those. She is the leader of the political party ""One Nation"". The ultimate goal for this party is to put a definite end to immigration, or at least to prevent non-European immigrants to receive access to the country. ""One Nation"" wants nothing to do with Asians, Africans or anyone whose not from the Western world. These people adore their British / European ancestry and they try by all means to preserve what they find genuinely ""British"". They want to look upon their country as Western, and do not want anything considered ""second best"".
Personally, I found it surprising and incredibly sad to hear about this. It is most likely just one out of many examples to be found about these things. By these things I mean principles I thought were internalised in us a long time ago, ""all men are equal"" should be a matter of fact, something everybody agreed upon. Equality should not be necessary to fight for in our days, it should belong to the past. A past everyone should look back at with anger and nausea, not being able to understand how people could possibly be so cruel to each other. ""Some men are more equal than others"" . I am embarrassed to say that this is still true. To a limited extent this is, still none the less.

My sister is exactly 14 months older than I. Her birthday is on November 5 and mine is January 5. This meant that she could start school two years ahead of me. I hated it. I used to sit in the stairs, waiting for her to come home. Sometimes, she brought a friend and wouldn`t let me play with them. That was always a great disappointment to me. But, I did`t give up. I made it embarrassing for my sister until she surrendered and I let me play along with them. I would rather play with her than any other. She was always much more inventive and a lot more daring than I. It was her idea that we should try to wriggle some money out of our Piggybanks. Of course, we knew that there was a moral aspect to it. Well, we weren`t exactly stealing, the money was, after all, ours. My sister was really good at wriggling the coins out of the piggybanks, mostly out of her own. I, on the other hand, wanted to save my money. However, I was willing to share hers. One morning my sister told me that she had seen some money on the top of the fridge. The top of the fridge was an inaccessible area, the whole family had agreed on that matter. It was almost impossible to keep it clean, and it was always sticky and dusty. Nobody would even dream of putting something up there. Maybe, somebody had left the money up there years ago, and totally forgotten them. I suggested that we took some of the money, and hope that nobody (e.g. my parents) would notice the money missing. It didn`t strike us at any moment that we were actually stealing. We were too thrilled with the thoughts of having money to spend at the candy store.
As you can image, we had a lot of fun together. I even cried my eyes out to come to her gymnastics class. All the girls there, were wearing two pieces suits which you could buy at the sport shop. My mother made me one. I felt so pretty wearing it for class. Every summer, all the classes at the gym gave a performance. The parents were invited. One year we were even invited to perform in Stavanger. It was so exciting. The boat trip to Stavanger took 4-5 hours, and we had to stay overnight at a school. We were all excited about the event.
The night before we were leaving, we had to pack. I looked all over the house for my little red wallet, the one I got for Christmas. Finally, I found it in my little doll house. I loved to make things for my doll, and I had made her a little doll house out of a paper box. The wallet served as a bed. I needed this wallet for the trip. I was going to keep my spendingmoney in it. My sister and I were talking about how much money our parents were actually going to give us for the trip, hopefully as much as 50 kroner. There was a kiosk onboard!
I could hardly sleep that night. The only thing I could think of was the great adventure that lay ahead of me. I could picture all the girls on the boat, playing around, eating candy and having fun. Finally, I fell asleep, dreaming about a huge lollipop.
The next morning, we were up early and bright. I was all settled at least four hours before the departure. There I was, sitting in the kitchen with my little red wallet in my hand, waiting for my mother to fill it up. "" Girls,"" my mother said, "" I am sorry to tell you this, but I had saved some money for you. I kept the money on the top of the fridge and now there are only 5 kroner left. I am sorry, but that is all I have left for you"".
Well, I guess it is needless to say that crime doesn`t pay.

Some people say that in our modern world, dominated by science technology and industrialisation, there is no longer a place for dreaming and imagination.
The world today is clearly influenced by science technology and industrialisation, and this influence increases rapidly every day.
In every aspect of the society industrialisation is dominating, and science technology has taken over large domains where humans once ruled. I might go to the extent and say that Man is less in demand. We have machines to live our lives, or we can live via the Internet and other virtual realities. You can turn on the computer, push a few buttons on the keyboard, and you are cruising down the information highway. Within minutes you have done your daily grocery-shopping, maybe bought yourselves a new outfit or two, and have it all delivered at your door a few moments later. Humans do the deliverance, but machines do all the preparations and logistics. If you add another fifteen minutes to your morning surf, maybe you'll even meet your virtual soulmate? There is really no need for books, newspaper and magazines, because if you search the web long enough, you can always find a copy and easily download it. And why use a lot of money on travels when you free of risk and hardly any charge can experience any wanted destination - and situation - through a live web camera?! You start your working day only by hooking up to the company's server, and by using the previously mentioned web camera, you are just in time for the 3 o'clock meeting.
If you for some reason have the urge to go outside your home and wander the streets (the automatic dog-walking leash is broken), you can easily bring the world with you. Modern mobile phones have everything you need, and a whole lot more. You can have your boyfriend's picture taken (if you've actually found the time to meet anyone), take care of your investments and even buy a soda from the nearest soft drink automate. Off course you start wondering if there is any room for dreaming and imagination in the modern society, with all these conveniences provided for us. You actually don't have to think at all. The thought of this makes me worry about the children growing up in the society today; not knowing what it's like living without the luxury this part of the world is ""blessed"" with. I am starting to think it is more like a curse, because it is no doubt in my mind that humans in general have become more shallow and careless than they used to only a few years ago.
However, I think it is each person's responsibility to decide how affected they let themselves and their children get. No one is forced to join a ""Nation of Zombies.""
You can take use of the Internet whenever you have to, and you don't have to let it control your life. It is really a matter of habit - you don't have to go to great achievements to break away from it. The stress is really in our minds, it doesn't have to affect us if we don't let it. It's a choice. In a stressed world - in the middle of a crowded street - anyone can turn off their phones, close their eyes and let their thoughts wander.

She can't afford a layer and her case is closed while the guilty ones, are still free of charge.
The very next day the same crime happens to our prime minister. It is on all the radio stations, in every Newspapers and on the TV screen. The police are still on the case, and our nations best lawyers were hired right after the incident.
But how can we allow this? Is it something that we are so used to that we wont care any longer, or do we want it to be this way. Unfair to ms. Andersen. Isn't it?
There will always be someone more equal than me. When I was younger I could never figure out why the grown ups opinions always were considered more important or trustworthy than my opinions. And why should someone always decide what I was supposed to do. But most important... How could a grown up just walk towards me and decide what I had done was wrong, and then go ahead and do the exactly the same thing. There were nothing I would find so unfair.
In theory it should be possible to let all men be equal. But in real life this is not possible. The communistic ideology is one good example. The theory behind, lifts up an ideal world, were everyone is equal, and no one have more or own more than others. But this theory could never make it. Because the leaders of such a regime, will always want or need more power than the others. And there are also those who know the leaders, and they too want more money or power. And then you have it all crashing and falling to peaces.
But some are more equal than others.......
And some are less equal.
As Darwin said ""Survival of the fittest"". Also when it comes to equality. We have to fight and be strong if we want to earn respect. We have to show respect to others for them to show us respect. Every life should be worth the same. Everyone should pay the same prise. But that wont happen here. To me, my family and friends are worth much more than an unknown person in Asia or another country. Your family or children means a hole lot more for you, than my family do for you. And in the world our athletics our famous singer, politicians and kings are of a much higher importance than our families.
But we are all equal somewhere. Just not in this world.

""Crime does not pay"" is an old used up slogan to deter people from committing criminal offence. But as to whether it is a valid statement, there can be disagreement.
Lets say that this is not a true statement. That crime does actually pay. In what context does it pay? I would say that in any crime for, profit or pleasure, where you actually get away with it, it does pay. In financial crime like simple tax evasion or large-scale fraud, the perpetrator is committing white-collar crime. The act is carried out at a certain distance to whoever is affecting. In a tax evasion case, the ""victim"" of the crime is the government, and for a medium income taxpayer it is easy to think that this money will not make a difference in the big scheme of things. And someone who succeed in scamming or draining large companies for money might feel that the loss won't hurt the company very much, since there is so much more left. The distance between the perpetrator and the victim is great, and this kind of thinking can justify the crime for the perpetrator, so they won't have to worry about that pesky little thing called conscience.
In other types of crime, profitable in any way, there are different types of involvement that is taking place, and the distance to the victim of the crime varies. In a bank robbery, for instance, the perpetrator is face to face with the clerks and customers in the bank, and some times people get hurt. Other times the people ""only"" get emotional problems leading to an inability to go back to work. In violent crime, like rape or ""blind violence"" or even murder (for profit or pleasure), the perpetrator might, or might not feel guilty afterwards. And for those who don't feel guilt, and are not caught by the police, then crime does pay in the sense that the perpetrator actually took pleasure in committing the crime.
In these examples one can say that crime does pay, at least for the perpetrators that got away. For those who didn't, the entire object of punishment is to stop the criminal from doing it again, and to prevent others from committing crime. And jail time is not supposed to be a reward, although it might be for some people in certain circumstances.
In violent crimes, the victim is not likely to have any profit, instead they have rather a large loss. So for the victim, one can probably say that ""crime does not pay"" is a very true statement. But can we always say that about the victim of a crime? When you have a good insurance, that may not be true. Sometimes you can actually get back more than the object stolen or destroyed was really worth. On the other hand the insurance premium might also go up, and if there were no theft, then we wouldn't have to pay insurance for that at all. So crime does not pay, unless you count the fact that no matter how much the insurance companies pay out, they always raise the cost of the insurance enough for themselves to make a profit. And no crime would mean less profit for them.
Society then would possibly be the one who loose out on crime. With having to pay for prisons and help the victims. Or it does in a socialistic society like Norway. In the USA on the other hand, we have seen that private prisons are making a profit, and the neighbourhood around it is making a profit in securing jobs and income. Sometimes the inmates are used for labour, at low, low wages. Is society then making a profit on its large population of convicts?
I really don't know, since I haven't seen any such statistics, but I do know that ""crime does not pay"" might not be an entirely true saying.

NOUO2022,3.0,,,,,,All armies should consist entirely of professional soldiers: there is no value in a system of military service,"
In Norway every man has to serve military service. It is written in the constitution that a man has the duty to defend his country against foreign military attacks. The normal age for a military recruit in Norway is 19 years. A recruit has to serve his military service for 12 months. First he, or she, is going trough something called recruit school. In recruit school the soldier gets his basic military education. After recruit school the soldier is placed in one of the military bases spread around the country. Here he is also given a task, a task that they will be doing the rest of their service. The task varies from place to place, it depends on whether the soldier is in the army, the air force or the navy. No matter what the different tasks are the main task for all the soldiers in Norway is to defend the nation. Norway' s defence relies upon 19-20 year old boys or girls without more than just a few months of training.
Norway is not the only country the world with a military service like this. In fact most countries do have such a system. For example Sweden, Denmark, Finland and Israel just to mention a few. But there are some countries that have different system of military service and a different form for recruitment. The main difference is that in these countries the military is based on volunteers. A person freely enrols himself for military service whereas with the Norwegian system he is being conscripted. Military service based on enlistment make the soldiers professional, the military service becomes their job. Some of the countries that are practising this system of military service are USA, United Kingdom and France. The probably best well known professional army is the French Foreign Legion.
Which system is the best? Most people would agree that the system based on a professional army are the best.
I do agree in that. Young, inexperienced, often in bad physical shape, are less adequate to defend their country and to take part in a war. A professional army handles a war in a much better way than an army based on conscripted soldiers. Using a professional army can keep the loss of human life in war down at a lower rate. A young inexperienced teenager will react different from a trained and experienced professional soldier in a war-situation. A professional army will also be able to deal with the civilians in a better way.
Why has not the Norwegian army become a professional army yet? One answer could be that Norway has very small population and to have a professional army would require a larger population. Another answer might be that the Norwegian politicians have not faced the fact that Cold-War is over. The Norwegian army is still organised as it were during the Cold-War, when the Soviet-Union was the enemy. Today the threat from Russia is almost of a non existing character.
To face the new types of conflicts that we see around the world a professional army is much more suited than an army based on military service. Also in the Norwegian army there will be changes, and one day in the future also the Norwegian army will consist of professional soldiers.

NOUO2023,3.5,3.0,3.0,3.5,2.5,4.0,All armies should consist entirely of professional soldiers: there is no value in a system of military service,"
""War is too serious to be left to generals"" is a saying that stresses people`s wish to partake in important matters that concern the whole of society. This past week, with the terrorist attacks on the US and the possibility of yet another world war, discussions concerning the use of professional soldiers as opposed to recruiting men for military service are especially relevant.
Advocates of using trained professionals find no value in a system of military service due to the fact that in modern warfare it is important to have thoroughly educated and experienced forces. Using ""the man on the street"" may prove to be a misallocation of resources; valuable resources wasted on people who will probably only use their newly gained skills for a couple of years. Not only does military service disrupt daily life, especially when the person concerned doesn`t have the makings of a soldier, but it may lead to a higher death rate. Professional soldiers on the other hand are fully trained in ""the art of war"", and have chosen this profession of their own free will. ""Send in the marines"" is an expression I`ve heard been used when there are conflicts which demand deliberate action.
So why on earth use military service? There are many, among them the Norwegian government, who believe that a man has an obligation to defend his country against possible enemies. Military service is a setting where people from all layers of society work together for the common good and this creates a sense of national identity and community spirit. A year of military service is good for other things too.... In Norway one jokes that in the military, boys become men away from their adoring mothers! Israel has a system of military service incorporating both men and women. This is probably deemed necessary in their case being such a small nation, but it also serves to unify them.
Sometimes you can find both cases. In the Vietnam war, raging from the late 60s to the early 70s, the US drafted soldiers alongside their professional army. This probably happened because the US lacked a big enough professional army, but current affairs also lead me to believe that ordinary people might want to contribute and defend their nation too.
It remains to be seen if Norway will keep on drafting soldiers when more and more are diagnosed physically or mentally unfit for military service and are therefore employed in the civil service. In my opinion this leaves only a fraction of our society to battle for us and this seems highly unfair. The life of an ordinary citizen is not worth more than the life of a professional soldier, but it is perhaps more traumatizing to witness inexperienced young men coming home in black plastic bags, as the Americans experienced after the Vietnam war.

NOUO2024,3.5,2.5,,,,,The prison system is outdated. No civilized society should punish its criminals: it should rehabilitate them,"
Crime is a serious problem that all societies have to deal with. The punishment for criminal offence varies from society to society, and also in degree of how serious the committed crime is, from fines to long or short-term imprisonment.
The main intention of imprisonment is to protect the society from serious crime in general and dangerous criminals in particular. In addition it is also meant to prevent people from committing criminal actions. The statistics, however, show that imprisonment hardly have the intended or desired preventive effect. A lot of the convicts have been sentenced earlier, often several times.
For many years there have been a lot of research on repetitive crime in general, and in connection with this, many convicts have been interviewed about their lives and beings. Based upon these interviews the researchers have been able to draw conclusions about different aspects that need to be discussed in order to be able to change the current situation. First of all it is important to look at the prison system. Many people today have the opinion that the prison system is outdated, and that rehabilitation is better than punishment. To find out why the system is outdated it is necessary to have a look at how the system functioned years back compared to today's system. One hundred years ago imprisonment was completely different from today. The social conditions were horrible. Physical punishment was an everyday occurrence, and the food was often poor with no or little nourishing value. Entertainment of any kind was unthinkable, and the overall conditions were inhuman compared to today's standard. Today convicts live a rather comfortable life with good food, proper clothing, entertainment of various kinds, and access to almost whatever they wish for. The only thing they are denied is their freedom to come and go as they please. First of all, many people believe that convicts today live a luxurious life instead of getting the punishment they deserve in payment for the damage they have caused. Secondly, they claim that the prison system is more or less a hatching nest for criminals. It is also said that if you are not a drug addict the first time you serve a sentence, you will come out being one after a short time. There must be something completely wrong with the security system allowing this to happen.
Based on the above-mentioned interviews of convicts, the researchers have looked at why people are sentenced repeatedly. They found out that a difficult childhood with often poor social conditions, and the lack of education, seems to be something that many convicts have in common. In addition almost all of them found it very difficult and sometimes impossible to get back into the society and start all over again. Without any education there are few jobs available, and they did not feel particularly welcome as an ex-convict.
How can rehabilitation be arranged to the best for both the public and the convicts? I think that the society will be better off if the convicts could pay for the damage caused by doing useful and meaningful work to the benefit of the society. Education is also an important issue. By offering the convicts education and meaningful work, they might change their attitude, and their chance of succeeding will increase the next time they are about to enter the society after having served their sentence. Hopefully will other people's attitude towards convicts also change if they know that the criminals are rehabilitated and improved as human beings. With the discouraging crime-rates and the latest research on repetitive crime I think it is worthwhile to give it a try.

NOUO2025,3.0,3.5,,,,,"Some people say that in our modern world, dominated by science and technology and industrialisation, there is no longer a place for dreaming and imagination. What is your opinion?","
Is there a place for dreaming and imagination in our modern world, dominated by science, technology, and industrialisation?
In the dictionary it says that the word ""dream"" means ""an ambition or an ideal""
If we were to use this as a definition of what dreaming is, my immediate answer would be ""yeas!""
This because, I think, in most of the western societies people feel as they don't have much more left to fight for. We get the feeling that technology and science will take care of all ""visible"" problems, such as health problems, environmental problems, etc. Industrialism has developed a strong economy in most of these countries, and the young people growing up today, were born into a wealthy family. Most of what is to fight for, are issues that has already been taken care of by previous generations.
If you ask some of the teenagers who are taking drugs today, why they do it, their answer is often ""I'm board"". There exist, I think a feeling of emptiness among many people. Almost every thing is for free, so to speak. This emptiness can lead to destructive drug use, but also for some people a search for something more spiritual, and new ideas of what things in life that is most valuable. This is what makes us continue to dream, and there for my answer to the question is also ""no"". We are travelling more now than ever before, we are interested in unknown cultures, in new ways of looking at life. Being a Buddhist is hip. People also mix different ideas from several religions. Some call it ""Shopping religion"".
What about using imagination? Even though our society has been dominated by industrialisation, science, and technology for quit some time now, there still exist a lot of creativity. The 20th century brought new ways of making art, music and literature.
Young people today, who grew up with computer games, and MTV, being used to entertainment almost every minute of the day, are just as much creative human beings as generations before. If not, there wouldn't have been so many new artists, writers, painters etc. A need of a room for using imagination makes people trying to find one.
My conclusion is that a society dominated by science, technology and industrialisation is not enough for most of us. In the 20th century human beings has in many ways desperately been trying to find their spirit. This shows in arts, filmmaking, literature as Modernism, and in new philosophies, such as Existentialism. The war protests, the civil writes demonstrations, and Flower Power in the 60's, was a result of people dreaming of change.
Good material conditions do not necessary mean happiness, a society that includes everyone and spiritual satisfaction, it does not makes us stop dreaming, it encourage us to dream even more. Sadly many people does not know any better than to by a dream as in a new car or replacing spiritualism with drugs. But still I believe that dreaming and using our imagination is one of the things that make us human, and the most of us will continue the never ending searching for the ""new"".

NOUO2031,3.5,2.5,,,,,Feminists have done more harm to the cause of women than good,"
If anything is worth mentioning from the 20th century, it is the change of women's situation in the western world. From 1900 to 2000 one could witness women achieving the right to vote, paid work, more or less equal salaries and education. In this struggle many parts have played some role. Suffragettes were central early in the century, labour unions have put in some effort and legislative authorities have been passing the laws that have made some of the progress possible. But what kind of place has the modern western feminists had in the struggle for women's liberation? Some would say that most women would have been better of without them.
The seventies political movement that introduced ""New-feminism"" has been very controversial. Their feminist ideas were new, radical and very controversial. This movement founded a new ideological background for the women's struggle. The early women's liberation movement was predominated by bourgeois women who focused on the issues relevant to their class. Working class women, on the other hand, did not organize in women's movements until later on. The new feminist movement was not oblivious to class distinctions. Their description of the world was based on Marx's description of capitalism, and they argued that the oppression of women was an economical as well as a cultural and legal issue. The issues that concerned them the most were equal pay for equal work, the right to choose whether to give birth to a child or not, making rape within marriages illegal and fighting porn, prostitution and violence against women.
To claim that feminists have done more harm than good to the cause of women's liberation would mean suggesting that most women would have been better off without their effort. How severe this suggestion is will not be clear without considering the results of their struggle. Women in, for instance, Norway went from being full time housewives in the sixties practically without the possibility of supporting themselves, to becoming more liberated women with the chance to determine their lives in terms of both work and family life. This, in addition to achievements like making rape within marriages illegal, hardly happened by accident. Neither is it particularly controversial to claim that these changes came about mostly because of the feminist movement's efforts. Now, if this is the harm done, one will have to question the political agenda behind such an opinion.
The harm done by feminists would, if anything, be due to their reluctance to behave like proper women should; get married, have kids, be beautiful and shut your pretty little mouth. It seems it is their behaviour, rather than their opinions and achievements, that is criticized. This way of treating women as a political force has slowly grown more out of date, and if I am not quite mistaken the infamous feminists of the seventies and their younger sisters had some say in that as well.

NOUO2035,3.0,3.0,,,,,The prison system is outdated. No civilized society should punish its criminals: it should rehabilitate them,"
Countries around the world have different prison systems. Some countries practise death penalty, whaile others let their criminals stay in jail. No mather what kind of a prison system a country has, the criminals get punished. Instead of rehabilitate the criminals by sending them to teraphy, the system lets the criminals suffer, either by being alone or by getting tortured.
I will first present the countries that do not practise death penalty, and then i will talk about death penalty. The essay will end with a discussion about what kind of prison system that will work the best, and how to renew the system.
Most countries do not practise death penalty, among these countries Norway is included. In these countries the criminals either get placed in prison or they have to do community service, it depend on the crime. After being caught by the police, the criminal is brought to trial. In trial the judge decides the extent of the crime, then the judge gets the criminal sentenced for the crime he or she has committed.
Let us use Norway as an example of a country that doesnt practise death penalty. In some cases the criminal only have to pay a fine. This is often in connection with for instance exceeding the speed limit, In other cases the criminals are sent to prison where its possible to stay for 21 years.
In the prisons there are a clear distinction on how the criminals are treated, and this depends on whether the crime is serious or not. But in all cases the criminals get placed in a cell. By being in a cell the criminals get little contact with the outside world. Some criminals nearly get anyone to talk to at all. A person who has committed a serious crime as for instance a murder is an unstable and sick person. We live in a society were everybody have the right to be treated equal, this also includes the criminals. A criminal should, like any other sick person, has the opportunity to talk to somebody about his og her problem.
Instead of letting the criminals stay in jail, some countries practise death penalty. Death penalty is mostly used in some states in the USA. When a criminal gets sentenced to death, he or she must have done a serious crime like a murder. A person who has killed another human being does not deserve to live, is the philosophy behind the death penalty. This is the same philosophy people used thousands of years ago, when ""an eye for an eye"" was the rule to follow.
The headline of this essay claims that todays prison system is outdated. I absolutely agree with that. Criminals who sit for many years in a cell with no one to talk to have probably not become better persons. If a criminal just sits day out and day in in a prison, he or she is probably filled with anger and revange against society. When the criminal has served the sentenced without being helped, I think its difficult for he or she to live a normal life as a decent citizen. If criminals are going to manage to live a normal life, i think they need to attend teraphy, The criminals can perhaps find out why the crime was committet when talkin to a psychologist and improve.
When it comes to death penalty, i do not think any countries should be allowed to use this kind of punishment. It makesthe State as bad as the criminal. Its the relatives of the criminals who will suffer. The criminals are executed and can no longer be hurted. By practising death penalty people should fear doing crimes, but in the countries that practise it the number of crimes hasnt decreased.
Its difficult to find a solution on how a prison system should work proporly. Some people mean its a waste of money to help the criminals with teraphy, while other people mean that a criminal should be treated equal with any other person. The most imported thing is how to increase the number of criminals without breaking the human rights.

NOUO2047,4.0,2.5,,,,,Feminists have done more harm to the cause of women than good,"
The ""Concise Oxford Dictionary"" defines "" feminism"" as: "" The advocacy of women's rights on the grounds of sexual equality"". It is difficult to understand the argument that feminists have done more harm to the cause of women than good. It is also a very provocative statement. It shows the narrator as a narrow minded uneducated person. Or is this a common belief? The problem is that the word ""feminism"" has a number of negative connotations. Many women are reluctant to use it because it is commonly being associated with a man-eating unattractive lesbian. Or of women burning their bras in the 1970s.
It is safe to say that Feminists (women's movement) have done a lot to improve the situation for women in Norway over the past years. Sexual discrimination was much more common 30 years ago. Many things have changed, and all for the better! In the late 1960s and the 1970s many women (and men) worked very hard to create society as we know it today. The result is laws dealing with the restriction of pornography, the right of self-determined abortion, forbidding discriminating advertising and ensuring equal opportunities and rights. Since then women have gradually become a larger part of society. Politics have gone from being mostly male dominated to involving both genders. Norway was one of the first countries to have a female Prime Minister.
The struggle for women's liberation started nearly two centuries earlier. Slowly a feminist movement began to rise and in 1848 the first organised women's movement was founded in the United States and became a role model for women's movements in Europe. Their demands were political rights, especially the right to vote in elections (""suffrage""- hence the name ""suffragette"" which mean ""a woman seeking the right to vote through organised protest"") and admittance to the Universities. ""The International Woman Suffrage Alliance"" was founded at a Berlin convention in 1904. The right to vote was granted Norwegian women in 1913. Most western countries gave women the right to vote in the two first decades of the 20th century.
The young woman of today will take for granted the fact that she is allowed the same education as her fellow male students. Or that her paycheck should be the same as her male colleagues. She might even think that feminism is a thing if the past. It is not needed anymore because men and women are equal. Unfortunately that is not the case. Many things have changed, but there are still a lot of problems to be solved in this matter.
The law states that women and men should have equal pay for equal work. The problem is that the distribution between high and low paid jobs is not equal. Women tend to occupy the low income jobs. These are traditional female welfare occupations like nursing and teaching. One of the challenges for the future is to encourage women and men to choose untraditionally occupations, to break away from old gender patterns. Another challenge is to create a more ""parents friendly"" work environment to make it easier to combine children and a full time job. A reason for the increase of women in the work force over the past twenty years is the building of many kindergartens. In 1980 only 30% of the children had a space. Today more than 75% have their children in a kindergarten. Part time work is still far more common amongst the women and they are also the ones who do most of the unpaid work (housework, looking after children). In 1990 women did more unpaid work than paid! So maybe we are not so equal after all?
One of the focal areas of equal rights politics has been the educational system. This is also the area that has been the most successful one. Today there are actually more women than men taking higher education in Norway! Maybe this will have a big impact on the future?
It is more important than ever to engage the whole population in creating a country that is fair to everybody. The issues are not just equal rights for women, but equal rights for all people. No one should be discriminated against for the sake of gender, race or sexuality. We should not be afraid of diversity, but instead encourage differences and make it useful. It is important to teach the young people that being active in politics is not a negative thing but a necessity. History is an important lesson when realizing our mistakes and trying to work at changing the world into a better place for all of us.

POPZ1001,3.5,,,,,,"Some people say that in our modern world, dominated by science and technology and industrialisation, there is no longer a place for dreaming and imagination. What is your opinion?","
One often hears the despondent voice their complaints about the deteriorating condition of human creativity which is due to the overdevelopment of technology. What a preposterous idea! Neither technology nor industrialization can impede our capability of dreaming or using our imagination since human minds intrinsically harbor vast amounts of creative powers. We simple need these to overcome daily hazards and excuse our uncommendable behavior.
One area in which we urgently need the help of our imagination is school. Every young person realizes that this institution is not the most attractive place in which to spend those short and therefore precious hours of youth. So rather than face the boredom of educational grind, we manufacture scores of elaborate excuses in order to avoid responsibility for our misdemeanors. And this in itself constitutes a miraculous mental exercise. Ages of formal instruction could not equal the intellectual benefits we reap of those intense bouts of creativity when we try to explain our absence, lateness or lack of homework. And what is more important, our inventive efforts have to remain vigorous all the time, since any excuse used twice becomes inescapably cliche.
It is a sad truth that adult life breeds adult problems. And this determines the different direction in which the development of our mental powers goes. We are now grown-up and sensible individuals and our worries are of adequately paramount significance. We will go to any lengths to be pardoned for our sloth and continue to be considered full-fledged adults. Thus, we no longer say: ""I have not done my homework because my dog chewed it up"" but we are more likely to come up with something like this: ""My child is in the hospital and I cannot come to work"" or ""My wife has just run away with my best friend so it was impossible for me to meet the deadline"". And it really does not matter that the person involved is a childless bachelor - the boss is so struck by the employee's tragedy that s/he does even notice this blatant inconsistency. It has to be remembered, however, the samples mentioned above are just the most basic and worn-out excuses that would never be used by a truly creative individual.
Ironically, we make use of domestic problems to excuse our inefficiency at work and the other way round. Whenever we come back home after midnight or (perish the thought) next morning, our boss (depicted as a ruthless despot) always plays the role of the culprit. Yes, that is true - coping with a shrewish wife or kind but a little bit dull husband also requires constant cerebration on our part. And here, our task is probably the hardest since no matter how vehemently we try to deny it, it is our spouses who know us best. Consequently, it is the quality of our brainchildren that matters most. No wife would believe that the office computer exudes the suffocating Opium-like fragrance, just as no husband (even the most loving one) would be willing to accept some flimsy explanation about his wife having to work all night with a group of special-slows before an upcoming exam.
When, regardless of all explanations we have used we are forced to shoulder the grievous burden of too many responsibilities and we feel we have too little time to truly enjoy the few pleasures that have been given to us, we can always afford a little flight from the grim reality - we can dream. In this harmless game called ""What Would Happen If..."" we are freely allowed to wallow in glorious visions of our success accompanied by inescapable failure of our mortal enemies-teachers, employers, spouses. Here our imagination reaches its zenith. We rack our brains with unheard-of intensity to invent the tortures that would suit those monsters best. And after such relaxation conjoined with an effective brain exercise we are ready to resume our educational, professional, and connubial duties.
There is not a single sound reason to worry that the advancing industrialization wreaks havoc on the formidable might the human mind is naturally endowed with. As long as humans interact the scope for their creativity will remain virtually unlimited.

POPZ1003,3.5,4.0,,,,,The prison system is outdated. No civilized society should punish its criminals: it should rehabilitate them,"
""Juvenile delinquents broke into an old woman's house, burgled it, and then, bestially tortured the defenceless victim. Her mutilated body was left on the floor."" Having read another report of this kind, one pities the victim but finds comfort in the thought that the wrong-doers have been caught and imprisoned. However, there is little hope that those criminals will be stacked away forever. Soon, they will be paroled for good behavior and will set on the evil quest again. By no means does the outdated prison system of punishment help eradicate the crime factor from modern societies. Thus, civilized societies should seek other ways of dealing with criminals; rather than incarcerate them, they should rehabilitate them.
Many people are drawn to breach the accepted rules because of shortcomings or deficiencies in their system of moral values. What's deeply immoral for the bulk of the society, they perceive as natural for the inability to distinguish good from evil. Others, capable of recognizing this distinction consider it irrelevant. Such was the case in the movie  where the two protagonists set out on a killing quest across America. They knew that what they were doing was evil and immoral, but they were not troubled by their conscience. The undeniable thrill, excitement and pleasure made them continue of their path. They are also people who break the law because their wretched living conditions stripped them of all hope. Modern societies should realize that these perpetrators cannot be responsible for their shortcomings because they cannot control them. Thus, separating criminals from the rest of the society will not change their psyche. The time and the money will be squandered on this purposeless effort. It is doubtful that these criminals will have any qualms for crimes they have perpetrated.
Being confined to a leper asylum never cured anyone of the disease. Quite contrary, having come in contact with other infected the disease progressed even faster eating away the person's flesh and bones and finally resulting in death. Similarly, prisons turn into crime universities. Those, convicted of lighter misdemeanors quickly learn how to go about organizing serious crimes. Instead of leaving the prison walls repentant and willing to make up for their wrong-doing, they leave predisposed and trained to become hardened recidivists. The prison life and contact with ruthless incorrigible offenders eats away their soul and conscience finally resulting in innocent people's deaths. If they had never been put to prison they wouldn't have absorbed the infectious microbe of evil. Had, instead, an effort been made to educate them to become valuable citizens, they would reenter the society equipped in necessary qualities to make their lives meaningful and successful.
However, intimidated law-abiding citizens would rather see their oppressors behind the prison bars. Little do they realize that they do not really secure safety for themselves. The overcrowded prisons are far from housing every offender. Moreover, paroles and temporary releases are issued freely to make place for new arrivals. Thus, criminals have the opportunity to try out new knowledge and commit further crimes. If the so called ""lomiarz"", the man who attacked women by hitting them with a crow-bar, hadn't been issued those releases five Warsaw women would still be alive. The perpetrator allegedly took advantage of his temporary prison releases to attack women.
The prison system of punishment proves greatly ineffective. Rather than help the society to do away with crime, it encourages felons to lightheartedly oppress innocent people. If the societies recognized crime as a kind of disease and treated criminals accordingly, not only would the prisons be empty but societies would gain new valuable members as well.

Violence and crime are one of most characteristic features of the modern world. In order to find a solution which would prevent the rate of crime from growing, many people point out that the key to the problem lays in rehabilitation of those, who have already committed offenses. Accordingly, the y regard the present systems of prisons to be outdated and not serving the purpose of improvement of those, who are kept in them. Following this point of view, no civilised society should punish its criminals but rather do its most to rehabilitate them. Unfortunately, this way of thinking, though attractive, is completely wrong. The biggest crime that a society could commit to itself would be to forgive its criminals.
Those who think that we should stop punishing criminals and lead them through the process of reeducation in order to improve their behavior and respect for the law, unavoidably follow the path of thinking established by some nineteenth century philosophers and criminal lawyers. According to this approach, criminals do not commit offenses because they are bad by nature, but rather it is because of the society which forced them to be who they are. How dangerous can accepting this point of view be, may be illustrated by a popular case of a murderer accused in nineteenth century Germany of killing somebody. He said to the court that he was sorry for having committed the crime, but he couldn't be punished, because he had been brought up by the people who regarded crime as something natural and accepted, and therefore the society in general is to be blamed for what had happened. Now we must ask ourselves this question: should we allow killers to get away with a not guilty verdict? Of course not! The judge in the case supported this point of view. He said to the accused that he was sorry, but he, in turn, had been brought up by the people who despised crime and he returned the death sentence verdict.
Society must never stop punishing criminals. It should be realized that punishment, contrary to what some people say, does have a significant purpose to serve. Criminal lawyers, as early as in the Middle Ages, invented the concepts of general and individual prevention. The latter is based on the assumption that if one suffers considerable hardships for his misdemeanour, he will not decide to commit a crime again. The former, on the other hand, presumes that if the general public sees how severe a punishment the convict has received for what he had done, it will not dare to commit the same offense. In other words, it will realize that crime does not pay. Indeed, people must be aware that if they willingly decide to go astray, they will without fail be punished in a severe and quick manner. This is crucial for any society in order to function properly. Rehabilitation, on the other hand, is based on a naive presumption that those who are already bad, will collaborate to improve their behavior. Will any manufacturer lower the prices of his products knowing that he is o monopolist? Will any horse pull a cart without being urged to do it? Obviously not! It is precisely the same case with criminals and rehabilitation.
One should realize, too, that the modern system of prisons is by no means outdated. As a matter of fact, it has never been as lenient as it is nowadays. People who stay behind bars receive decent food, stay warm, may receive regular visits, may write letters and write books, even watch television. Many, on special occasions, are allowed to visit their families outside a prison for a few days. What more should they need? A swimming pool with a swim-up bar and sunglasses? After all, the idea is that they are supposed to endure hardships. One century ago, prisoners could not even dream of such conditions as there are in the prisons today. Water and bread in a dark and damp cell was all they could count for. Today, societies agree to pay great amount of money in order to support comfortable enough prisons, for the people who have done nothing better than to show their disrespect for the law and morality. This fact is rarely mentioned, although it is quite important and should not go without recognition.
What all idealistic points of view have in common is that it is not feasible to put them into practice. It would be simply wonderful to live in a society without prisons and without criminals, either (those few ones who have chanced to put their foot on that land would have already been rehabilitated). Unfortunately, such a state of matters would quickly lead to complete anarchy. We must realize, that prisons are perhaps too comfortable by this time, and the only way to prevent crime is severe sanctions and quick punishment.

POPZ1006,4.0,4.0,,,,,Most university degrees are theoretical and do not prepare students for the real world. They are therefore of very little value,"
University studies are the highest level of education provided by most of the world's education systems. Theoretically, graduating from a university is something of a great value. It is supposed to mean getting a better job, university graduates are associated with high social position. Therefore a lot of young people decide to study at university. After having graduated from a secondary school they decide to continue their education and the most prestigious way to do it is to enter a university. However, in nowadays' world the number of students who are disappointed after having graduated from a university is increasing. The value of a university degree seems to lessen. The knowledge gained at a university does not help young people to achieve success. The fact that the value of a university degree is very little in the real world is conditioned by various factors.
First of all, during the studies a student is ""forced"" by a curriculum to choose less and less subjects which automatically leads to concentrating on a very narrow segment of knowledge. This in turn means putting less effort in studying other, in one's opinion less important subjects. The most obvious example of negative consequences of such a narrow specialization is incompetence of medicine doctors. Having great and detailed knowledge in one field they very frequently cannot diagnose properly illnesses of a more general nature.
Secondly, the more prestigious studies are, the more theoretical, knowledge is required from students. Additionally, such knowledge concerns various fields. Students of economy, for example, during the five years of their studies have to study various subjects which tackle different problems that are not necessarily connected with one another. Such theoretical knowledge proves to be useless in a real world because usually, at least as far as economy is concerned, practical knowledge is definitely more profitable than the one gained at a university.
The distinction between practical and theoretical knowledge is connected with another factor contributing to the theory that university degrees are of little value in the real world. The knowledge that a student has after having graduated from a university is only theoretical. In very few cases students have an opportunity to use their knowledge in practise or to gain professional experience while studying. However nowadays, the key-word while applying for a job is ""Experience"". The number of years one has worked in a particular profession is in most of the cases more important than the marks he/she got for his/her M.A. thesis. The very basic requirements imposed on people who want to work for some prestigious firm are the ability to work on a computer and to use a fax-machine (not to mention typing), fluency in more than one foreign language. These are the things which are usually not included in a curriculum of studies. Consequently, usually none of them is a requirement for getting a university degree. What follows, for a potential employer the fact that an employee has finished university is of a very little importance and in most of the cases will not be the decisive argument during the job - interview.
All the above arguments lead to the conclusion that graduating from a university does not mean that a young man or woman is prepared to face the requirements of the real world. The prestige of a university degree remains unchanging but in order to achieve success in nowadays' world one needs knowledge from various fields. So the fact that one has graduated from a university will remain only a subject of a personal satisfaction as long as one does not prove that he/she is really good at something. Then a university degree will become the trump in one's hand and claiming that it has some value will not be baseless anymore.

POPZ1007,4.0,4.0,,,,,"In his novel ""Animal Farm"" George Orwell wrote ""All men are equal but some are more equal than others"". How true is this today?","
George Orwell in his Animal Farm wrote: ""All men are equal: but some are more equal than others"", showing how gifted he was in observing society and human nature. Neither society nor human nature have changed since the novel was written. One can easily notice today, even in democratic countries where ""all people are equal in the face of law"", that people are still far from being really equal. The most influential factors that make people unequal are: race, sex and money.
The color of skin has always differentiate people. The strange thing is, however, that the most obvious reason why people are of different colors, that is because of the climate zone they or they ancestors come from, is the least popular one. White men are usually those who think of themselves as superior because they were the ones who conquered less developed nations. The whites regarded other races as worse, unable to equal them. This situation was reflected in the laws of many countries. Nowadays in democratic countries people of different colors have the same rights. However, still many people are so conceited or biased that they cannot accept equality, and discriminate races different than theirs. The discrimination can take place in neighborhoods, schools or places of work. It can take the form of lower payments, worse chances in competition with other races (e.g. while looking for a job), or not including people of different color into neighborhood communities or social meetings. It shows that introducing equal laws does not mean real equality in society, and changing people's minds takes much more time and work than changing laws, and still is not always successful.
The second factor that makes people unequal is sex. The legal situation seems to be similar to the one described above: the rights are equal, however life shows that it is far to real equality. Men's and women's different position in society is rooted mainly in their traditional upbringing, the prejudices concerning their role in society, and the mutual misunderstanding. Even though now women are free to choose their own ways of life, and they do not have to follow the traditional pattern of being only wives and mothers, it is still very often more difficult for women to gain the positions equal to those men have in their professional lives. Women are often discouraged to start their careers, sometimes are paid less or forced to choose between having a successful career or having a family. So, the saying that a woman has to be twice as good as a man to gain the same position is surely not an exaggeration but the illustration of what being ""more equal"" means.
The last, but for sure not least factor that differentiate people is money. In fact this is the most powerful factor which can overcome race and sex differences. Let alone all the illegal action that can lead to multiplying a fortune, having power and influence. Having money means independence from anybody (e.g. parents or employer), possibility to decide (as a shareholder or the boss of enterprise), freedom to buy all the necessary or unnecessary goods, and the freedom to travel. Money also makes it possible to run for an office and to win. A high position in the world of politics means power and influence again. The race or sex of a person who is really wealthy is not that important, and the person is ""much more equal"" than the rest.
Equal rights for everyone in a democratic country seem to take equality for granted. However, not only law, but also people living in the country, with their prejudices and fears have to change to allow the real equality. It is possible when sex and race are concerned: people can learn to tolerate and respect one another. The situation is a little different with wealth and power. Probably in this case the Orwell's sentence that some people are more equal than others will always be true. Or maybe the author wanted to tell us that total equality could never exist.

POPZ1008,3.5,2.0,,,,,"In his novel ""Animal Farm"" George Orwell wrote ""All men are equal but some are more equal than others"". How true is this today?","
""All men are equal: but some are more equal than others"". Equality. What is equality? Obviously, the belief that all people living in this world have the right to have a similar social position and receive the same treatment, regardless of their apparent differences. We live in the world that is dominated by science technology and industrialization. The breathtaking technological advancement is visible everywhere. Societies all over the world differ a lot. People, despite the close of the twentieth century, are still being divided into the white, black, red, or yellow, the affluent and the poor, the old and the young, the unemployed and the employed e.t.c. There is no doubt that people are put into categories. They are judged on the basis of their colour of the skin, intelligence, income, abilities, dwellings, affluency or poorness. Such a categorization might threaten the precarious balance among human beings. There is no question about it, inequality is here. No one is unaffected either by racial prejudice, nationalism, explosion of technology or being simply an old person. Inequality poses a threat to our privacy, even to our concept of reality. Thus, the words written by George Orwell in ""Animal Farm"" that ""All men are equal: but some are more equal than others"" are still applicable to the reality we deal with. Although, as this century closes and we enter the first computational millenium, one of the great conflicts in civilization is the attempt to reorder societies, cultures e.t.c. preventing people from the ""checks and balances"" so delicately constructed in those previously ""flourishing"" centuries.
The most vivid example of inequality is the belief that abilities depend on race and that some races are superior to others. In some countries where racial prejudice is acute, violence has so come to be taken for granted as a means of solving differences, that it is not even questioned. There are countries where the white man imposes his rule by brute force. There are countries where the black man protests by setting fire to cities by looting and pillaging. Important people on both sides, who would in other respects appear to be reasonable men, get up and calmly argue in favour of violence as if it were a legitimate solution, like any other. What is really frightening, what really fills one with despair, is the realisation that when it comes to the crunch, we have made no actual progress at all. We may wear collars and ties instead of war paint but our hostile instincts remain basically unchanged.
The bewilderment of the black man is caused solely by the action of the white one. What are the lessons about democracy which the black has learnt from the white? What has he learnt about liberty, equality and fraternity? Definitely, the black is none the wise seeing and observing the white. Before we can even contemplate peaceful coexistence between the races, we must appreciate each other's problems. When dealing with each other, white men depend on force. It seems that the status quo is preserved by violence. The basis for all racial conflicts are religious, political and cultural. It happens that the white are far less tolerant than the black. Generally, the white love to be superior and wield power. People think in stereotypes. They fear of other people who are e.g. visually different from them. The only way to get a hearing is through violence. Violence improves our status, encourages others respect us as a force to be reckoned with. Violence is sometimes a well-tried means of achieving peace and can succeed where other means are bound to fail.
Racist beliefs have been used to justify genocide, chronic poverty and the maintenance of systems of inequality - such as South African Apartheid. The whole of the recorded history of human race, that tedious documentation of violence, has taught us absolutely nothing. We have still not learnt that violence never solves a problem but makes it more acute. The sheer horror, the bloodshed, the suffering mean nothing.

POPZ1009,4.0,3.0,,,,,The prison system is outdated. No civilized society should punish its criminals: it should rehabilitate them,"
I do not agree with this statement. I think that the prison system is the best way to punish criminals provided that every sentence is actually executed without any exceptions. In the cases of the worst atrocities there should be the capital punishment introduced and executed without changing it into imprisonment under any circumstances.
As long as human race exists there has always existed crime. People established certain laws to curb crime and for many years depriving an individual of his or her freedom or just taking away his or her life has been the only way of protecting society from cruelty, of misfits. Punishment inflicted on those who broke the law does not seem to be a sufficient deterrent only when it is not executed entirely for some reason or other. That is also why there is still a growing number of cases of so called serial killers. Those are the people who kill repeatedly, particularly after being released from prison too early.
Another aspect of the subject is choosing the right punishment for the most serious crimes. There are cases in which the capital punishment is indispensable. Let's look at the example of Dennis Nilsen, a British mass murderer who killed twelve people and dismembered the bodies of his victims. Some time ago he appeared on TV to give an interview in which he presented explicit details of his atrocities. His words delivered in a matter-of fact tone could almost serve as a beginners guide for potential killers on ""how to murder and dispose of your victims"". When the interview was broadcast, it gave Nilsen four minutes of fame and granted him a celebrity status and glamour. It is not difficult to imagine, however, how much distress this programme brought to the relatives of Nilsen's victims, and what is more, it could have encouraged others to follow him. Such a warped man as Nilsen should have been excluded from society long ago, not only by imprisonment, but by the capital punishment.
Rehabilitating people who committed grisly crimes should not take place in a civilised society. This may lead to the anaesthetization to the human cruelty and the whole society may become inured to violence. Dubious remorse shown by criminals is going to evolve into new atrocities very quickly. The individuals who commit crimes are usually weak, ineffectual people and they can assert some power only by killing or by other kind of breaking the law. Very often they themselves admit that they are not able to lead normal life and in exceptional cases, like in case of Westley Dodd, they publicly plead to be executed for their crimes.
There are many arguments for the prison system and against rehabilitation of criminals. Obviously, such a severe punishment is right for them, and what is more, it scares others. Anybody who wants to commit a crime must know for sure that when it comes out, there is no other way but prison. Such system eliminates from the society individuals that may have a very destructive influence on others. Besides, the money that would be spent on rehabilitation of criminals should be allocated to the prevention of crimes instead. What is also very important, the society must know for sure that there is justice in their country and that all the criminals are going to be punished properly. Nobody would like to see acts of revenge done by victims' families in a civilised society.
Bearing all this facts in mind, I think that the prison system is by no means outdated and that every civilised society should punish its criminals in this way.

POPZ1010,4.0,2.0,,,,,"In the words of the old song: ""Money is the root of all evil""","
An encyclopaedic entry gives such a definition of money: 'a common, unchanging equivalent of goods which marks their value and can be exchanged for them'. Its origins, dating as late as four to six thousand years ago, are connected with a sociological division of labour which found its expression in the separation of husbandry from handicraft. As a consequence, a surplus of certain goods appeared which could serve as means of exchange. Those goods which were the most transferable became directly exchangable for all the other articles and thus money originated. In the earlier ages, various commodities served as money, later precious metals such as silver and gold started to function as a general equivalent.
From this brief history of money and its invention, it can be observed that it is possible to mark an exact moment when money began to be present in the existence of the mankind. Thus the saying that money is the root of all evil seems to be rather unlogical. It is not easy to state when evil came into being, it seems to be a sort of universal category and a feature of all human beings. While evil has existed as late as our first ancestors started to inhabit the Earth, money is but a human invention, just a useful tool which makes the trade more efficient. Rather, man's love of possessing, greed and unlimited desire to have causes all the wrong which money is unjustly blamed for.
It is, however, true that money rules the world. As far as historic sources can tell us, there has always been a certain regularity concerning money. It is, the clear distinction between those who have been in possession of money and those who put a lot of effort to gain it. Moreover, what can be easily noticed is the striking disproportion between these two categories of people. The number of those, who have been trying to find out various ways of possessing it, in other words becoming rich, remains in a predominant majority to those who actually already have had it and have been rich.
My view is that it is this disproportion which can be accounted for the evil in the world, not money itself. The common lack of it, on the one hand, and demoralizing power of its excess in much fewer cases seem to be a problem. For it is a universal truth that the disturbance in balance is the source of trouble. Our society, in a result of civilisational progress, operates on such principles which condition the fact that even the most basic needs of man can be fulfilled only when paid for. Food, clothes, accommodation, entertainment, every single item in our surrounding has its price. Even human body as a whole or just its separate parts have a market value and can be sold. In fact, everything has its certain value expressed in some amount of money.
The natural and distinctive feature of all people is aiming at comfort and security. There is nothing immoral in this tendency. Further, possession of money gives many obvious opportunities and options of fuller existance. The problem appears when not everyone can achieve all the advantages simply because of the lack of money. Again, the impossibility of existing in a modern world without it is clear. The living examples might be all the people who struck by the extreme poverty have found themselves at the very bottom of social piramide, nearly loosing their human dignity. They would, for sure, attribute their status to the lack of money.
The opinion that money cannot give happiness has been functioning for ages. Is it really so? People asked for the definition of happiness would probably point at health, knowledge, security or love. Money, of course, is not a direct equivalent of all these things but if one wants to be honest, it would be necessary to admit that money, to a great extent, helps to achieve all of them.
Money itself has little value. It is just a scrap of paper or a piece of metal. How can it be, than, so powerful that, on the one hand, it may help to achieve ultimate happiness and, on the other hand, it is the underlying cause of crime, hatred, humiliation, ignorance, depravation and corruption. Money is not evil. Rather, evil which, just as good, is an innate feature of all human beings makes them treat money as a good excuse for all the wrong in the world.

In the present world wreathed in the flourishing ideas of democracy, freedom, independence and tolerance there should, theoretically, be no space for racism, sexism, xenophobia or persecution. The average modern human being prides him/herself on open-mindedness, liberty of thought and tolerance. Nevertheless, the practice shows that what a white person puts actually most pride in is the skin colour while for a male individual it is his masculinity and for a Christian the religious beliefs to be exalted. The rule, of course, is that always the majority or the socially and culturally privileged group usurps the right to acclaim their qualities and features as these of a higher status.
What is interesting, the open fight or the explicit discrimination is apparently perceived as primitive and inhumane while any covert action brings rarely such negative connotations. Therefore, it would not be generally accepted to say that some men are superior to others but the dissembling statement that ""All men are equal: but some are more equal than others"" sounds fair enough to be approved of. Indeed, nobody is free from prejudices and inferiority or superiority feelings and, as a result, true equality remains only an abstract notion. People have, alas, always had tendencies to discriminate or exterminate what is different or unknown.
At first, what seems nowadays superficially preposterous is the fact that it is a female individual who finds most difficulties in being viewed as equal and treated with full respect by men. Although the process of emancipation has been already completed there will always remain some deeply rooted conceptions about women being less immune to the hardships of life. The main fields in which this can be visible is the world of politics, business and entertainment in which woman plays usually the role of a ""toy"" or a supplementary element. Since men are prime ministers, employers or entertainment recipients women will always remain lower officials, employers or entertainers. For those to whom the above statement seems too far-fetched it is enough to look at the percentage of women in Parliament or at high offices, not to mention with whom the word 'prostitution' is usually associated.
Traditionalists may claim that women are biologically programmed to bear children and fall back into marriages, and that nobody is so good at supporting husbands in their careers as wives. Nevertheless, are men biologically programmed to minimize the roles and potentials of women and nip their ambitions in the bud?
Secondly, the most unsettling and delicate aspect of the problem of equality, or rather unequality, is the racial and religious persecution. While any kind of overt hostility or oppression provokes disapproval and the majority of enlighted modern liberals take a dim view of racism and intolerance, the numerous admit to a 'slightly' racial tendencies. Not everybody would, in fact, dare to commit a ""petty crime"" of calling in public a Black person the Niger or harassing his family but scarcely any individual would hesitate to show favouritism to the people of his/her race . Is not it true, however, that racism and discrimination begins when one evaluates oneself as the better while not simultaneously maintaining that somebody else is worse? From whichever angle we would scrutinise the problem in question it is evident that people always tend to compare and label themselves and there will always be some hierarchy, no matter what criteria we would establish as the basis for the hierarchical structure.
In conclusion, the absolute equality was, is and will be impossible. Whether it is human nature or stark reality that causes the segregation and discrimination, remains a rhetorical question. It lies, however, beyond doubt that despite the written law and numerous attempts to provide every individual with the right to his/her individuality, people will never experience equality. Racism, sexism or any kind of persecution may, of course, work in two directions but irrespective of whether it is the Black or White, man or woman, Christian or Buddhist who is harassed there is, anyway, somebody who stays ""more equal than others"" in this relation. If only the eradication of the negative human tendencies to discriminate was possible our world would free itself from many unnecessary wars, conflicts and social problems. Is it, however, possible?

The contemporary world is becoming more and more influenced by science and industrialisation A contemporary man does lot realise how much science contributes to his or her life. When a telephone, a TV set, a radio or a computer are so common as any other everyday facility, man unconsciously diverts his or her attention from dreaming and imagination. That influence is a threat that has the gradual effect on all of us, it diminishes our ability to think thus to dream or imagine.
There are various other factors that limit the development of our mind. First, the communication development, as it has become so easy, there is less need to concentrate the mind. To receive information, we need only sit in front of the TV set and flick from channel to channel with a remote control. To impart information, we need only pick up a telephone and throw out phrases in random sequence, punctuated with ""ums"" and ""errs"". In the 60s the Canadian philosopher Marshall McLuhan predicted the advent of film and TV would have as radical an effect on our culture as the invention of a printing press had on the culture of the Middle Ages. He predicted that books would become obsolete in one generation. He has been proved wrong in that point, however, who knows what would happen in 100 or 200 hundred years, as although more books are now published than ever before, the vast majority of these books demand little literacy, imagination and intelligence. Having been at the centre of our culture for the past 3 or 4 hundred years, they have now been pushed to the margins, either as adjuncts to TV series, or as a form of entertainment for those few moments when we are out of reach of a screen - on the beach, on a plane, or as a help to prepare people for sleep at the end of a busy day.
Twenty or thirty years ago, writing letters, keeping diaries were common, people could use words to communicate various, vague emotions, they could use their minds to express thoughts in a concise form. Nowadays, with the use of electronic aids, telephones, videos, faxes, etc., there is no longer place for words, now the content is more important than the form and we are beginning to abandon the habits of thought. It is very frightening as it all starts very early, computer toys, digital watches, calculators, computers are present in the children's lives from the very beginning. Children instead of learning to think grow up convinced that these electronic aids are their right. They learn dead vocabulary that has nothing to do with Shakespeare or Milton. The impute of information they get is boring and mindless and the use of computer breed laziness and discontent. From the very childhood they learn that thinking and organising will be done for them and later this computer generation assumes that it is better to calculate, buy petrol, tell the time, pat the bills or shop with the aid of a computer. Children and young people glued to the computer screen will be more and more common phenomenon. Parents, unaware of a danger, are happy that their beloved kids are developing their minds while they in fact do nothing of that sort playing violent, sophisticated computer games. These children have simply no time for thinking and their behaviour is just the sign of the fact we are entering the computer age which is the age of dehumanisation. What is even more scaring is that people who express misgivings about the use of electronic aids by children are considered to be unimaginative, old-fashioned and out-of touch.
To sum up one can draw one frightening conclusion that there is apparently no way in which we can stop the development of science and industrialisation. The only possible solution lie in ourselves it should be of our concern not to allow technology to interfere with our lives too much and to use it wisely, trying not to eliminate from our lives the ability to think, communicate, love, dream, and imagine. However, one must ask him/herself the question whether he/she is strong enough to resist the influence of science and technology. In the majority of cases the answer will be no, as it impossible to do so. What is left then? Are we going to turn into mindless creatures without imagination and dreams?

POPZ1020,3.5,2.0,,,,,Most university degrees are theoretical and do not prepare students for the real world. They are therefore of very little value,"
Huge number of people begin studies every year. The appetite for knowledge, abundant social life and lure of the so-called academic world has brought them all to big cities, where universities and colleges are located. And there they have been affected by academic way of living, so rich in purely theoretical courses that are hardly, if at all, relevant to the outside world. Before passing entrance exams most students had hoped that after three or five years of studies they would reach a kind of prestige and social high status, and this position will secure relatively high salaries. In reality, though, things are different. People who have already got various degrees lack basic abilities to cope with the problems of the real world. Moreover, it is this ability which is valued, rather than the knowledge of theory.
Academic staff, together with students, create a world of its own, a vacuum for which nothing from the outside world is of any interest and hardly anything out of it is applicable beyond its boundaries. Universities are totally isolated from the outside world, scholars focus on some abstract disputes rather on their possible implications. Instead coming up with theory-based solutions for today's problems, scientists stick to their useless theories in which nobody is interested except themselves.
It is no wonder, then, that students graduating from such stagnant worlds lack skills that might prove handy in the real world. The majority of subjects taught at universities contribute to the students' general knowledge, although later on, provided that a student does not choose academic career, nobody will pay any attention to the courses that a given student completed. Rather, he would be interested in the practical skills and abilities to cope with certain problems, which universities seem to have neglected.
Even if the need for such skills has been recognised by academic world, students taking part in more practical courses cannot resist the feeling that their practice is both unreal and simulated. Consequently, they do not treat those courses properly, not performing as well as they would have been forced to in a real life situation. As a result of such an attitude students do not benefit from those courses anyway.
Apart from that, universities do not develop skills of making one's way through ruthless reality. As students at universities, they feel secure and comfortable, but at the same time, unaware of the problems existing outside. They proud themselves on getting a high grade for some theoretical projects or congratulation on a given lecture, whereas, in fact, it is life that assesses, not teachers.
Degrees achieved by students at universities present no value. Despite of their being challenging, or even thrilling, for one has to put much effort into them, one has to be careful not to pay too much attention to the academic work. Since universities fail to prepare for the real world, students have to do this on their own, probably applying for the job while still studying. After all, total negligence of the outside world may result in an inability to cope with its problems. And this would be a disaster.

George Orwell or actually Eric Arthur Blair is, in my opinion, a writer who described totalitarianism in the best way. I mean, it cannot be done better. It does not matter if we are talking about socialism, communism or fascism. Orwell described a system which includes all those enumerated above. He described in a brilliant way mechanisms which work in all of those systems.
In one of his essays Orwell wrote that politics is a kind of a subatomic world in which part can be bigger than a whole. According to Orwell world of politics is too complicated to talk about equality in it. He once said that Stalin and his colleagues having the best intentions could not behave in different ways in reality of that time. There is no equality if there is any hierarchy. Since 1930 it was possible to notice signs of attempts to establish clear hierarchy in Russian society which completely argues with the idea of equality. Orwell thought that English people could not understand the system established in Russia because they wanted to believe that somewhere in the world there is a country of real socialism where equality is the highest virtue. Of course we know that there is no such country. It cannot exist as there will always be a kind of hierarchy. There will be always a ruling class: ""more equal"" people who pull the strings and ""less equal"" group of society which has to work hard. Orwell admits in one of his essays that there is no complete democracy in England. Definately there is no equality in England nowadays. What is more there is no equality on any street of any town in the world. Because how should we understand equality? What kind of criteria should we use to describe and estimate it? Is it only money, good job or position in society? In my opinion we can consider equality also when we are talking about love, health or friendship. People have various talents and abilities but is it always just? One can learn three languages within two years fluently. The other one is able to learn one language in that period of time on a very poor level. It is not just but that is the way it is and nothing can be done to change it. It is much more tragic if we consider the idea of equality in connection with health, life. Some people are born with misshapen feet, some are blind or deaf and some will not live until they are thirty because they have a serious heart disease. Is it just? Is it equality? No. However no one can change it. There is no equality in love. Some are loved and adored and some spend their lives lonely and unhappily although they are ready to give and receive love. However they are not attractive or outgoing enough and they remain unnoticed. They will never know the taste of self-realization in love. They will never know how it feels to be the only person for the other man. It is not equality. However this is reality. And we have to face it. Equality was never possible. It is not possible now. The statement about ""more equal animals"" regarded as a metaphor applied to society is as true as it was fifty years ago. Those who promise equality are liars or mad people. Knowing history we can see how tragic were results of ""equality"" proposed by Lenin: hunger, concentration camps, cultural and economical destruction of a country. The result was bloodshed and terror.
Krzysztof Kieslowski describes the problem of equality in one of his three films which together are called Trilogy. Kieslowski in his film called ""White"" seems to be saying that there is no equality in love or any other strong feeling. White represents equality in French flag. However the idea of liberty, equality and brotherhood was also born during violent and brutal revolution.
Unfortunately there is no equality, it never existed and it will never be the main virtue of human race. Some attempts to change it are possible but they will never be successful. Looking at present situation in the world Orwell could see with bitter satisfaction that what he said was never more true than it is now.

POPZ1044,3.0,,,,,,"Some people say that in our modern world, dominated by science and technology and industrialisation, there is no longer a place for dreaming and imagination. What is your opinion?","
Man has always dreamt of making his life easier. Primates had to struggle for survival and try to improve harsh conditions of life. With time, man started to feel secure and warm in his cave; yet, out of greediness he wanted more and more ... He dreamt of better life with permanent light inside his dwelling place, he dreamt of being able to fly and move from place to place quickly and easily. Most of his dreams came true and man became an advanced creature who managed to achieve a lot thanks to the power of reason. But a price had to be paid for this ...
Now man has everything his forefathers dreamt of but does it mean that he does not dream any more? And here a paradox arises - man wants to go back to his roots. He longs for a quiet, peaceful life, far from the sight of sky-scrapers and traffic jams. Of course it is mere wishful thinking as we have gone too far in our run for making our lives better and it is practically impossible to turn back now.
It is obvious that our lives are dominated by modern science and technology - we are victims of our own creation - but I would not agree that there is no place for dreaming and imagination in this world. Very often people are simply ashamed to admit it but dreams have always been an important part of their lives. The fact that we live in the age of spacecraft does not mean that imagination has been rejected. It may not be as explicit as it was in Homer's days when Greeks lived in the world full of gods created by their own imagination, but it is present in our lives. Like our Victorian predecessors we feel endangered by the development of science and technology and that is why we try to escape into the world of dreams. It is possible by means of literature and Disney lands. The former is very fertile. It has always been the means of giving way to emotions of various kind and imagination running wild. Writers, poets in particular, have tried to show the beauty of the world and contrasted it with the ugliness of big cities and their industrial development. Some film makers have also used their imagination in order to create an unreal but beautiful world of fairies and good spirits, and as an outcome we have such films as ""Hook"" or Disney productions. I remember how sad I was after watching ""Hook"" and how I kept asking myself, ""Why don't we live in a fairyland where everything is so pretty and simple? Good wins over evil and everybody is happy?"" But then I came to the conclusion that this world is in fact inside us and we are the only ones who can make it live on or die.
A Disney land is a paradise not only for children but also for adults. It is a place where grown-ups forget about the existence of taxes, bills, morgages, etc. It is a place where time has stopped and where everyone forgets about their problems just for a while.
But not only is there a tendency in art to escape into the world of dreams but also in architecture. People get and tired of concrete and iron and they seek after solitude in the countryside. The cottages adorned with flower baskets are a truly delightful sight and to me they are an expression of people's longing for simplicity and peacefulness.
I have tried to show that people of all ages have had various dreams and desires. It is obvious that they differ from age to age but they have always been and always will be present in mankind no matter how more advanced we may become. And I really do hope that Aldous Huxley's gloomy prophecies presented in his novel  will never come true and that people won't turn into unfeeling creatures deprived of this precious thing called imagination.

POPZ1045,3.5,3.0,,,,,"In the words of the old song: ""Money is the root of all evil""","
At the very beginning I should say that I only partly agree with the above statement. In my opinion money is the root of evil indeed but certainly not of all of it. There are other reasons that make people choose the wrong path. Those could be ambition, power, fame, or even alcohol and these do not have to have anything in common with money.
Let us imagine two old ladies who are neighbours. They always try to exceed each other in everything. Both of them have the most beautiful gardens in the area, best cut lawns and hedges. But one day one of the ladies finds out that her neighbour has bought four splendid greyhounds which look so terrific playing in the garden. Unfortunately she has no funds to buy herself four dogs that are so expensive. She cannot stand the fact that her neighbour is better. She steals secretely to the neighbour's garden and she poisons the dogs. She did an extremely evil thing which was caused by her sense of being better than others, her ambition and also jealousy. What does it have to do with money? Nothing, unless we say that she had to by a poison for it.
Doing evil things for power or fame many times is connected with money. There are people who strive to get better positions or to became famous it would give them more money, or better connections which would make it easier to make money. But we need to point out the fact that there are many maniacs who love to be in charge of everything and they would every evil thing in order to have everyone in their hands, to manipulate people and kame them dependent.
At the very beginning I have mentioned also alcohol as one of the reasons for evil behaviour. We all know how many murders are committed by people who are intoxicated. Alcohol makes people unable to think logically. Murders are effects of a momentary impuls raised by anger which could not be suppressed by reason. What does this have to do with money? Nothing at all, unless again we say that the murderer needed money to buy some alcohol. Of course we can agree that people murder for money, but there are also other reasons: insanity, jealousy of a husband etc.
The words of a song yet are true. Money is the root of evil because it is the only mean for our life commodity. If we have money we live better. But in order to have money we have to earn them by hard work and not all people are hard-working. On the other hand there are jobs in which no matter how hard you try you will not earn enough money to feed your family. Finally, there are people for whom there is no job at all. These people might do evil like cheating or stealing. In this way money again has been found to be the core of evil deeds.
Yet everything depends mainly on the personal qualities of a particular individual. For one person money could matter very much, the other could not care for it at all.

POPZ5006,3.0,3.0,,,,,All armies should consist entirely of professional soldiers: there is no value in a system of military service,"
It is almost unbelievable that the Swiss once used to be the champions of warfare and the only remnants of those times are the guards at the Vatican. It is also unconceivable that we consider ourselves a civilized people but we are unable to solve problems in a reasonable conversation. After all, we are thinking creatures so we talk instead of spitting in an opponent's face and unsheathing a sword to prove being right. We all want peace but to desire it is not enough. The first step toward achieving it would be getting rid of the permanent armies and as a result banning conscription. Thus, in other words, a compulsory military service should be abolished in all countries.
There are, of course, opponents of such an idea. Some of them maintain that all countries need soldiers in case of war. Others say that combat may be a good school of life for young people.
However, for certain vital reasons these both view-points can be easily refuted.
First of all, nations do not need ample regular forces as the times when a country's strength was in numbers have long gone by. Nowadays we have so-called ""push-button"" warfare thus unskilled manpower has become insufficient, if not completely redundant.
In addition to this there cannot be any ""in case of war"" statements. Today's wars would be nothing but tilting at windmills. Either side would win. In fact, the score could be only a total extermination of the world. Thus wise leaders, ubiquitous television showing horrors of a prospective combat and ominous experiences of the nearest past should contribute to the abolishing of obligatory military service.
In reference to the other view that opposes the suppression of compulsory military service one can beat it easily setting forth even more arguments. By maintaining that combat may be a good school of life for young men, this group of people prove their ignorance and smattering of the subject.
After all, no one can, in a mere two years or so, be trained and ready for the requirements of modern combat warfare. What is more, this period may be considered a desruption in life that does not provide such a compulsory soldier with any useful experience with regard to his future career.
This service can also turn out to be a waste of time, a spell of unrivalled boredom and the only dubious skills that be acquired are smoking and toping. Besides it is often a source of cheap labor power for the military.
An additional disadvantage of military service is that it does not build up human character; on the contrary, it can warp it. It may also be the cause of the loss of one's own identity, all in the name of discipline and patriotism. The obedience to superiors' orders is ""one up"" on soldiers' own moral values and sense of justice. It is enough to mention that the notion of ""free choice"" does not exist in military language and being pushed about and bullied is not a rare case.
And finally it must be strongly emphasized that barracks are not a suitable place for striplings who are at large and treat war and guns as fun. It is a place for mature, educated, and sober-minded volunteers who want to be professional soldiers.
To conclude, let me hit the point hard that a compulsory military service be invalidated. Quite a number of reasons could be presented in favor of making this statement. The most important of them is that such action can result in the achievement of widespread peace. So let us not hesitate and allow others to push their highly ideological, obsolete opinions. Let us abolish the compulsory military service in all countries.

RUMO1014,1.0,2.0,,,,,The prison system is outdated. No civilized society should punish its criminals: it should rehabilitate them,"
To my mind there are a lot of advantages and disadvantages in the prison system. The system is urgent for society so evil must be punished. Impunity creates a higher criminality level. For as Voltaire said ""A little evil is often necessary for obtaining a great good"". A criminal should regard his imprisonment as a punishment and know that the punishment is inevitable. Imprisonment may be a means of deterrence for some people, which under the threat of punishment will refuse to commit a crime. A prison should educate prisoners and give them a chance to think of their behaviour. May be it is too cruel to deprive somebody of freedom but unfortunately it's necessary nowadays because of very high criminality level in many countries. In the first place we should protect honest citizens, which shouldn't suffer from criminals. As the whole I'm for the prison system but sometimes after imprisonment a man became worse than he was before. And here I'm against it. We know a lot of such cases. The first reason of it is that often inveterate law-breakers and people, which broke a law firstly or even accidentally serve their sentences together in the same place. I'm sure that prisons should be different: for example, prisons for hardened criminals (so-called thief in law), ones for criminals having committed grave crimes, ones for criminals having committed light crimes, ones for teenagers, women and so on. Even it's may be enough sometimes to sentence a criminal to pay a fine. As for criminals which commit crimes more than, for example, three times, their punishment should be doubled. Besides they should be kept in spesial conditions. The conditions should be very severe. As for criminals committing light crimes they should be kept not very far from their home place that their families could visit them. Special attention should be paid to teenagers. The question of teenagers' criminality is extremely complex. Many countries faced the problem. The matter is that sometimes it's difficult to make them answer in proper time. Many of them feel impunity and commit greater crimes, but nevertheless they are teenagers. They need a special individual approach. To return them to a normal life needs the work of psychologists. Besides they haven't any profession and when they release they can't find a job. In a prison teenagers should be educated and prepared for a new life. As for prisons for women it's so grave problem that I can't discuss it. In general the prison system is a very important institution, will be necessary for a long time. But it must be ridded of its disadvantages and take into account local conditions. Then it will meet demands of the time and serve our society perfectly.

RUMO1020,3.0,3.0,,,,,Most university degrees are theoretical and do not prepare students for the real world. They are therefore of very little value,"
The topic of the composition is very difficult to cover in a short essay. In my opinion the level of higher education in a country is a matter of great concern of every sober-minded citizen. Therefore if the policy-makers and MP's want their country to be or become prosperous and survive in this severe world they have to scrutinize thoroughly the present system of education and to improve it or to develop a new one. As for me I graduated from the Kiev High Air Force Engineering College in 1984 and got a diploma of radio engineer, thus I know nothing but a little about the Modern Universities. Trying to recall those days of studing now I am inclined to think that the system of higher education was great. It is true is has some disadvantages, but it was one of the best in the world. Higher education here was professional. There were no schools comparable to western liberal arts colleges. Students entered a higher school to prepare for a definite field. There were one to three leading schools in each field of knowledge and science. Thus if a capable boy or girl wants to become an authority in the chosen subject he or she should try to enter a certain University.
When a cadet I was eager to learn because I knew my college was the best prestige in the Air Force. It had a high quality of teaching faculty and research facilities and it accepted only two to three out of every ten who applied. The syllabus was complex and there were some dull and unnecessary courses. Not knowing where we would serve and what we would do we had to study various subjects. That's why our range of knowledge was wide. To my mind it was an advantage and disadvantage simultaneously. It was the disadvantage because we had to know things which we wouldn't ever concern for and it was the advantage because we have got the necessary views or horizon to be a competent avionics engineer. The main thing which makes me to respect my tutors and always remember my college is skill to learn. Only this was enough for me to be ready for the real world.
None of the tutors or universities can prepare anyone for real life because no one knows where he will be tomorrow. Thus a university has to teach a student to be ready to meet reality of the world and to adapt himself independently of where he will be after his graduation.
I had the meeting of alumni in June this year. I met my friends whom I hadn't seen since the graduation. And I was very surprised to learn that even problem students had achieved success in their careers. They could adapt themselves perfectly although they might have known nothing about things they had met but they know the way to study them.
Finally I must confess I can see no reason to oppose that most university degrees are theoretical but I would find it difficult to accept that they don't prepare students for real world.
Nowadays we see a lot of successful businessmen and policy-makers with diplomas of engineers, lawers, and even musicians. Therefore universities degrees are not of very little value. Moreover, why did people create the system of higher education? As far as I remember it was done in the Middle Ages. The university degrees were more theoretical then than they are today. Students had to study the ""dead"" languages like Latin and Greek, nevertheless they discovered the virus of small-pox and developed the telescope.
So in my point of view the main idea of whether the university prepares students for real life or not is whether they achieve success and make their country richer and more powerful or not.

RUMO2002,3.0,,,,,,The prison system is outdated. No civilized society should punish its criminals: it should rehabilitate them,"
Criminality arose with the appearance of human society. The problem of punishment of criminals existed even in rather primitive societies. The forms of criminality and the attitude of people towards it changed throughout the history of the development of mankind. The philosophic nature of the problem is that the criminal was always a member of human society. The imprescriptible principle of a group of judicious beings is humanism. But society had never managed to reconcile itself to the criminality as social feature. And was always thinking about the ways and methods of suppression. The laws punishing the criminals permanently improved as well as the forms of punishment and rehabilitation. But still the excellent society with no criminality at all never existed in the whole history of mankind.
All history of mankind is marked by the attempts to improve laws about criminals and the punishment. We have to assume that the methods of punishment developed rather conservatively. And in principle they still remain the same. At the beginning of human history society tried to punish criminals immediately - to cut off the thief's hand, to quarter, to hang. With the development of civilisation the ways of punishment were becoming more and more various and even human.
The isolation of the criminal from the healthy part of the society was the main principle. That is how prisons and other means of isolation appeared. We have to assume that the methods are the same nowadays. Of course, super modern prisons exist now. The idea that criminals should be rehabilitated seems to be rather reasonable and up-to-date. But the situation in different countries is very different. Even very controversial opinions appear about how the prisoners should be treated. In Sweden, for example, criminals are mollycoddled. One of the most well-known prisons is Easterocker. In order to get into this prison criminals stand in a queue for a long time. If they want to stay in this prison for the whole period of their imprisonment they have to sign a contract. They promise they will not take drugs, drink alcohol, they will study or work. Every month prisoners have a vacation. They leave prison and go home to see their family and friends. But even in prison their living and housing conditions are very favourable. Every prisoner has his or her own cell, which looks like a usual comfortable room. There are a TVset, tape-recorder, video, books, posters on the walls and separate convenient toilet. Prisoners are treated not like criminals and anti-social elements but like usual people.
An average local prison in Sweden is not much worse. In this country prisoners are usual people. They have an opportunity to continue their usual normal life, but they don't want to commit a crime. In this case we can say that they are not punished but society is really trying to rehabilitate them. But in other countries laws are still isolating criminals, not rehabilitating them.
We think it is not the best way to solve the problem of criminality. Contemporary laws put criminals in position of strangers, who are rejected by 'normal' people. It is the main contradiction between the struggle with criminality and an attempt to eradicate it at all. People who spend most of their lives in prison are automatically rejected by the society of 'normal' people.
Now we face lots of global problems in economy, ecology and politics. The characteristic feature of our time is the rise of new forms of criminality. And this problem needs a more profound and deep analysis. The methods of suppressing criminality are outdated and new psychological-philosophic approaches are necessary.
Human methods which will give criminals a chance to become full-valued members of the society must be put forward.
The social and moral, mental conditions are different in different countries. So it is not possible to produce the common law for different societies. But I think that society must try to create good social living conditions for people, which will prevent them from committing a crime. In most criminal cases it is the society, who must take the responsibility. In every case there must be an individual approach to the criminal. Because in every case there is a certain pattern. A very large proportion of the people who come before the court are in some way or rather inadequate. They've never fully grown up emotionally. They react to the situation rather as a child would react to it. They often form the impression of people who really do need some help, some treatment and not punishment at all.

RUMO2003,3.5,2.5,,,,,"In his novel ""Animal Farm"" George Orwell wrote ""All men are equal but some are more equal than others"". How true is this today?","
Social equality is one of the most controversial values of modern society. Over the centuries, Christianity has been promoting an idea of all men being equal in the eyes of God. Since the French revolution equality, brotherhood and freedom have been proclaimed the highest virtues of any society. It is widely recognised now that a country could be considered civilised only if the equality of all human beings translated into social relationship clearly implies that all men should have equal opportunities, i.e. equal starting conditions.
However, people are different in terms of their talents, dedication, goals in life, etc. This difference seems to deny the very idea of equality. Human ambition makes people seek positions of power which promote the sense of their exceptional value for society and superiority over other more humble human beings. Excessive ambition is a theme addressed in the best pieces of the world's literature. Macbeth has become a symbol of disaster caused by excessive ambition, Raskolnikov showed the world what happens if a person considers his life more valuable than the life of other persons, however useless or insignificant. An ambitious desire of a person or a group of persons to prove themselves and the entire world that they are smarter, better, more deserving than others gave rise to all racist theories, the consequences of which in the XXth century are too well known.
Hopefully, one of the lessons the mankind has learned in this century is that a society based on social or racial inequality - slavery, fascism, communism, apartheid - is not only immoral, but is doomed to backwardness. If the slave labour were effective, Russia would have the highest living standards in the world., and the communist regime would have prospered. Even the opponents of the idea of human equality are presently forced to admit that this concept is widely recognised as just and stimulating. G. Orwell's catch phrase reflects the need to pay at least lip service to equality even by the worst totalitarian regimes - true, 'all animals are equal', but with 'some animals being more equal than others', the status quo is restored. The appearances are saved but the basic principle of inequality is in place.
The most common arguments against social equality are that it looks nice on paper but is unattainable in real life, that natural inequality of men makes social equality a dream, a desired goal at best. Therefore, 'some animals' have always been and will always remain 'more equal than others'. It cannot be denied that some people are more talented, energetic, sophisticated than others. However, the world will be a better and more secure place to live in if the advocates of human equality persistently worked on promoting a better understanding of what it actually means in terms of social relationship and social justice rather than hypocritically shutting their eyes to natural inequality. People have to feel that they are valuable members of their society regardless of the amount of their personal contribution to its development, let alone the colour of their skin, ethnic origin, 'party membership' or other such privileges or disadvantages.

RUMO2004,3.5,3.0,,,,,"Some people say that in our modern world, dominated by science and technology and industrialisation, there is no longer a place for dreaming and imagination. What is your opinion?","
Imagination and dreaming are the basis of all human activities. If science technology and industrialisation exist, it means that people can imagine them. At the same time not everyone can imagine a hydroelectric power station in detail. It demands a special mentality. Such mentality on the one hand is a result of personal experience, on the other hand , this experience is always connected with a general tendency to view the world.
Modern technology is not only a result of economical development but also of aesthetic one. These industrial landscapes and other things of the same kind are possible because a century ago there lived people who created new aesthetics of constructive art and architecture. They sought for new forms to express their feelings and their minds generated images that became foundation stones of new culture. We can call such people as people with active imagination. Their pictures, sculptures, projects were absolutely unusual but they were adopted by a substantial majority of contemporaries. Why was it possible?
One of the reasons is that constructive art was so closely connected with innovations in technology that its utility, not always obvious but always real, was discerned by the people. They borrowed fruits of imagination from other people. But such adopting is possible only when your mind is ready to do it. Images, as a rule, are not generated from emptiness. Imagination is a storehouse of allusions, ideas and many other subtle things. An ability to perceive images depends on aesthetic education, which is not a result of learning arts, but a natural product of human daily practice. Every man always plays a part of an aesthete whether he has an impeccable taste or not and even if he never went to school. People with 'passive' imagination ( which can't or doesn't want to affect the world) partly use adopted images. But their unconscious evaluations of every phenomenon ( is it beautiful? could it take place in my dreams? is it compatible with my fantasy?) create an environment in which technology develops.
When people believe that some combinations of colours, or shapes, or something else are not ugly they will reproduce them in their own fantasy. They can be accustomed to any way of imagination. So to image is a very responsible act because people in their imagination can create any unusual thing that can be absolutely inhuman. I mean not some brutal acts, but a situation when a man imagines things which are not of 'human scale'. As a result he can live on the fortieth floor of a sky-scraper like a bird.
But there live people whose way of imagination doesn't coincide with a modern model. They never like modern architecture, they prefer romantic literature, when they speak about music the main idea of their speeches is that a romantic period in music was too short and so modern music is not adequate to the consciousness of their contemporaries. In other words they are people who want time for dreaming. Dreaming really takes a lot of time that is very difficult to find in our crazy world. It is not important whether such man imagines himself as a medieval knight or as an astronaut he tries to defend himself from the modern, very aggressive world. So to dream is very useful for mental health ( of course, not running to extremes). And, I think, we can support these people because everyone of us feels a certain lack of humanism in the modern industrial world.
It is obvious, I believe, that we have to distinguish between imagination and dreaming.
The first one is a mental environment, that is an integral part of a human personality and it exists in our modern world dominated by science technology and industrialisation as well as in any other world which is changing with times. But dreaming is a process that enables us to go astray in the world of imagination. Everyone can take part in it, but not everyone wants to do it, believing that it is a waste of time, nevertheless, a dreamer can always find time and place for dreaming.

RUMO2005,3.0,2.5,,,,,"Some people say that in our modern world, dominated by science and technology and industrialisation, there is no longer a place for dreaming and imagination. What is your opinion?","
It is really true that the world of science and technology is rapidly developing. Every year life in the human society becomes more civilised. New technologies, new machines, new services are invented for the people, our modern civilisation spreads. New discoveries make the standards of living higher and higher. Our modern world is completely rational and science, computers and machines really play an extremely important part in our daily lives. We have such great services as electricity, television, radio and many others at our disposal. Sometimes it even seems that there is nothing more to discover.
When the human society was not so developed people had only rudimentary knowledge of the world around them. People in the primitive society were afraid of such phenomenon as, for instance, thunder lightning because they could not explain these strange things. So they used their imagination and tried to make these inexplicable things clear and understandable. During thousands of years the mankind gradually broadened its vision and now scientific discoveries may throw light on almost every phenomenon. But still there exists a number of things which require some investigation. Many explanations are still hypothesises.
I would not deny that in our extremely rational world people acquired a rather realistic world view. People who believe that there is no longer a place for dreaming and imagination may be partly right from this point of view. We do not believe in miracles very much. But however imagination is something that belongs to the human nature and people do dream very often. They do dream, whether they are satisfied with the reality or not.
We cannot say that imagination is something outdated nowadays. There always exists one thing which is very closely connected with the world of fantasy - this is childhood. Children always remain children - whether the society they live in is industrialised or not. They play games, they fantasise, they believe in fairy-tales.
One more unreal part of our real world is literature - no one would deny that fiction contains a certain amount of imagination.
People enjoy reading books because they are interesting and each book has its own imaginary world, atmosphere made up by an author. We read about this world, we plunge into this atmosphere, we somehow try to sympathise with the characters, to live like they live, or to feel what they do. As far as I am concerned I always try to put myself in their shoes. Literature is a brilliant exercise for speculating about the reality. Fiction is full of eternal problems such as good and evil, love, kindness and humanity.
As far as imagination is concerned poetic literature is a case in point. It deals with symbols, images, figures of speech which are often based on the poet's associations, on his fantasies. I do not think that poetry is outdated nowadays. Life, culture and literature are very closely connected.
Every person has his own inner word and imagination is the inseparable part of it. If there were no fantasy in people's minds, if we excluded dreaming from our everyday lives, life simply would not be interesting enough and it is my opinion that people with vivid imagination make this world more exciting. I believe that imagination is something we should not lose in our modern world obsessed with science and technology.
While speculating on this subject I came to the conclusion that it is difficult now to draw a distinct line between miracle and reality. Science can make wonderful things. A few centuries ago people were dreaming about the things which are firmly established now. Who knows what tomorrow brings? Probably things that seem to be fantastic today a few years later can turn to be a reality. Life is changing all the time. Some day our dreams can come true. There is a probability that today's fantasies will not be fantasies tomorrow, and science and technology can provide a great help to it.

The Russians don't know this point well. It is very far from our minds. I don't say that the criminal problem is not important, but it is very special in Russia. The main points of it are organised criminality and prevention of crime. But prisons... Who cares, what's wrong there now?
As far as western society is concerned, the situation can seem to be dramatised from the Russian point of view. Their criminal levels are not lower, than ours. But nowadays they take care of preventing the crime much more than how to punish the criminals.
Now I want to draw your attention to an article about Swedish prisons published in 'spid-info', N9 1995. Swedish prisons are very comfortable, cells look like hotel rooms, there are TV, bookshelves, toilet and bathroom. Interviewed director of a Swedish prison says that she doesn't thinks this system is dangerous. A possible threat of a terrorist attack is not the main danger.
The first thing criminals need is rehabilitation. She speaks about motives for different crimes. For instance, the strongest motive for thieves is not to work, and very often there is a pattern of drinking or alcoholism. Alcoholism is an illness, and if somebody is ill, the best decision is to cure him.
But a real problem whether to help a person or to deny him comes, when violent crimes are concerned. Of course, we can send this person to prison. But the best way to prevent a new crime, she believes, is to put this person on a probation. Very often people who commit violent crimes are really pathetic. They are teenagers who come from single-parent families. Sometimes violent crimes are committed by the drinkers and people, who have serious personal problems or even mental illness. People who spent a few years in a prison also need a rehabilitation. They are out of the society, they can't find a work, other people don't accept them. As a specialist, she thinks, it wouldn't be right. Every society must run a rehabilitation scheme for the people who were in prison.
Now I want to draw your attention to another aspect of rehabilitation. Here I want to say a few words about Russian criminality. European problems seem to be very local in comparison to the Russian organised criminality. This kind of crime does great harm to the society now. It's necessary to say here about the so-called 'apartment's business'. These crimes are usually committed by organised groups of people, often well-educated. They find some miserable old people, single 'babushkas', drinkers, promise to help them, give them some money and then turn them out of their houses.
The schemes of these crimes are usually very complicated. These Mafia groups always consist of professionals and it's very difficult to charge them with anything.

Another sort of crime is fraud. It becomes more and more popular in commercial sphere. There appeared a new 'star' in Russian criminality. Russian Mafia is, of course, less impressive than Stalin now but commercial crimes and, especially, business fraud have hit their highest level last year and continue to increase now.
The main question is who should be charged and with what and who should be defended? Victims or criminals?
I think, the society. Undoubtedly, the Mafia problem is far from the minds of common people. They believe, that social defence is much more important in the time, when the troubles of the present with the potentials of the future are found side by side in Russia now. But macro political situation has a strong effect on the microeconomical situation, and they can not exist separately.

RUMO2007,3.0,2.0,,,,,All armies should consist entirely of professional soldiers: there is no value in a system of military service,"
I asked my mother: 'If I were a boy, would you allow me to become a soldier?' My mother answered: 'I think it would be your own choice whether to make a military career or not'. I asked again: 'And what about military service?' She said: 'I would do my best to protect you from the army'. I think it just illustrates the situation in our country. In Russia all mothers are not satisfied with the military system because this system offers danger to their sons. What are the reasons for this?
Our army consists of non-professionals. It is impossible to secure a real defence in large countries because of their dimensions. Numbers of people who devoted themselves to army life is not enough for proper defence of our frontiers. Consequently an army can not consist only of the professional soldiers, it needs fresh regularly renewed powers. There is certainly a great value in a system of military service. But the whole military institution should be revised.
A friend of mine suggested a variant. One must destroy the army-service system. It may help to avoid fear before the army. A new army system will be created from the very beginning, there is no sense just to redo it. We will have new laws, new rights. But what will be with the professional military people? We can not leave out altogether. Their life and career are connected with the old army and they are real professionals of their business.
There is a dilemma, a very argumentative question.
Let us discuss another aspect of this problem. Acknowledging a necessity of army-service for every male person we come across the situation of involuntary taking into war, making people to be at war by force. If a country takes part in some military actions ( I don't mean the defence of Motherland), it uses its military forces. In our case the boys who serve in the army according to the law can find themselves at war involuntarily. More than that they can be subjected to the risk of being killed. This is unfair. I think every state should have a system of military service ( for protecting borders, for example), and a system of military volunteers ( who could be participants of any military actions out of the native country territory). They are professional soldiers and have special salary for their service. When they reach the statuary ages they retire, have privileges.
The conclusion is I don't agree with the composition's title. There must exist two types of military organisations: both the army-service system and the voluntary military system. Maybe it is an Utopia but nevertheless it is my own understanding of the problem.

RUMO2009,3.0,3.0,,,,,Most university degrees are theoretical and do not prepare students for the real world. They are therefore of very little value,"
If one asked learners what their learning aims are, they will probably answer, in general terms, that they want to improve some or all of their grammar, vocabulary, writing, listening, reading, speaking, while a few of the more enlightened might include pronunciation. These aims are rather too vague.
And how do you think the University should "" prepare students for the real world""?
First of all, every single student must prepare himself for the real world without any assistance, independently. Taking into account the variousness of students' aims it is impossible to establish universal courses which are good for all learners equally. Everybody has different purposes. Generally speaking, university degrees must be theoretical. If you are well-educated theoretically you have all chances to achieve success in real world. Therefore, it is impossible to say that university degrees are of very little value. It is very likely that a university course was not just time wasting for someone, on the other hand , one could find the lectures in Classical literature useless for the real world.
Being at school, you start to ponder over your future, what you have to know or to learn for your profession. And according to your aims you choose the direction or field of knowledge you want to develop in. Thus, the learner begins to study mathematics, physics, languages that he thinks will be useful for him in future. The role of the teacher in this process is to direct learners. Learners need guidance as to what their aims are. When the students are given instructions for a task, let them say what they think the aims of the task are.
Every area of learning is a learner- development area. Many of teachers tell students that the best way to help themselves to make good progress is to read. The learner development must come from the learner. But, the responsibility for promoting such learner development is the teacher's. They should be trying to make their learners development part of their normal teaching. In their turn, learners must learn how to set themselves specific, realistic, and therefore, achievable aims; otherwise they will not see any progress from their efforts, and will, consequently, get frustrated or disillusioned.
Thus, the role of the professor and the University as well is to urge the students, to lay down the foundations, to acquaint the learners with the basis of the subject; but details should be mastered by the student himself - nobody can do it better!
And at last, the value of the university education depends on the quantity of information you have learned. And it is also important how you can use that information.

RUMO2011,2.5,3.0,,,,,The prison system is outdated. No civilized society should punish its criminals: it should rehabilitate them,"
While starting my essay I tried to think it over. Though nothing depends on my opinion, which is far from being authoritative, still the question is very acute and important, I would say. You see, nowadays in our country which is overwhelmed with sorrow and grief because of its economic problems, if I can put it like this, very little attention is paid to the ethic and psychological sides of life. I can't say it is unfair, because there is very little which can be done with the 'health' of the society until it gets rid of its deadly foes: inflation and poverty, but it may be too late some day. So let's try to imagine that something has changed positively in our country, though the question raised here is acute all over the world.
A person commits a crime. He is caught, arrested and there is much to be done for the solicitor and the court. At last the Judge's hammer strikes three times and we see the eyes of the criminal - sometimes they are full of fear, horror; sometimes - he looks with the air of embarrassment, and sometimes he considers himself to be guilty but right - so he tries to hold stiff the upper lip! But you see there is one more thing to be added to this chain - its main link - the nature of the crime itself. I would say that a very large proportion of people who come before the court are in some way or other inadequate. They, probably, have never grown up emotionally and react to different situations rather as a child would react to it. And the overwhelming impression is that the people who have got into trouble of this sort do need a certain help in one way or another.
You'll agree with me, I'm sure, being very sympathetic with people who have physical disabilities, we'd better turn to those who have emotional and intellectual shortcomings.
Another criterion that is of great importance is what we call the circumstances in which the crime has been committed. Sometimes people have no way out but to make a forgery or to steal something. It sounds odd, but it happens so that on the way you act depends whether you'll die or not. But let's drop this subject, because it's not typical.
In another situation we deal with juvenile delinquents. These children, being from big families, become aggressive and afterwards antisocial.
In any case when the time to punish a criminal comes, the lawyers should think it over and decide how strict the punishment should be in this particular situation.
I can't call a prison the most effective institution for criminals whom I've written about. In prison they have practically no chance to make good, to correct themselves. On the contrary, they usually become more cruel, hardened. They forget about their souls and they don't see any way out and in future continue committing crimes. This is the reason why the society should rehabilitate the criminals. The question is how?

RUMO2012,3.0,2.5,,,,,The prison system is outdated. No civilized society should punish its criminals: it should rehabilitate them,"
Nobody knows when the first prisons were invented and came into being, but, no doubt, they appeared in the civilised society, where people could really appreciate freedom and understand, that taking one's freedom away is a terrible punishment, and only taking one's life can be worse.
Theoretically an imprisonment as taking one's freedom for a definite period of time, makes a person understand how precious is the freedom. And in future a former prisoner is supposed to do his best not to get into prison again ( now I'm not talking about life imprisonment, which usually is just a more human substitution of the death penalty.) But practice shows that a vast majority of people, who once were put into prison, commit crimes again, a predicted punishment for which is another imprisonment. And it is really a vicious circle.
Of course, the prison system has its advantages and disadvantages. It is really a disputable point whether an imprisonment is still the most effective way of punishment or whether it is outdated and modern society should invent a new way of re-educating its criminals.
On the one hand, it seems to be an indisputable question, that criminals should be isolated from the society, and, certainly the prison system perfectly suits this purpose but crimes are so various, and it is really illogical to have just one way of punishing for all of them. Of course, the prison sentences differ according to each crime, but, anyway, the personality is not taken into consideration, and this often makes people commit crime again.
Society thinks ( and it, certainly, has all reasons for that), that a criminal should expiate his fault, but yet society hasn't realised, that sending criminal to prison is not the best way of expiation.
Prisoners are supposed to work, and usually they do the most hard and dirty work, which is practically unpaid. But it's obvious that such unpaid and unfree work can not be effective and productive. So, the society doesn't have any use of prisoners' work. May be it could be better not to put to prison those people, whose crimes are not very serious and who are not dangerous somehow for the society. They can stay free, but certainly in the centre of intent attention of the police and psychologists, who will not let them commit a new crime. In this case a person can go on with his job without losing his proficient skills while being in prison and stay with his family as well.
This, I think, should be of primary interest and importance for the society. It was always believed that children from the families, where one of the parents is put into prison commit crimes more frequently than children from normal families. And no doubt, it is in the interests of the society not to let these new crimes be committed.
Sending criminals to prison, society expects to re-educate them, but in the vast majority of cases people, and especially young people, are so shocked by their getting into prison, that they grow bitter and dream about revenge. And, as usually they don't mean a particular person , they desire to punish all the world. Naturally, it has nothing to do with re-education. This bitter and angry prisoners consider themselves to be victims and they even don't think about expiation. Prison makes a person bitter, cruel and vindictive, and it is most terrible, aimless, because being in prison, a person has one main aim and dream - to get free. When he gets free he meets a great number of problems outside the prison: he usually cannot get a job, as he has lost professional skills; he is alien in the society and sometimes even in his own family. And person commits a new crime and gets into prison again, but this time it's not so shocking and frightening for him. And who knows, may be the third time sending him to prison will not be a punishment for him at all.
We should admit that the prison system is not the best and the most effective system of re-educating criminals, but the fact is that prisons existed from the ancient times. Always and everywhere people were discussing whether it is the best way of re-educating criminals and, probably, tried to invent something effective. The prison system is not perfect, but it is, perhaps, the best of all possible. At least mankind did not invent anything new during long years of existing of mankind itself, of crimes, criminals and the problem of their re-educating.

RUMO2013,3.5,3.0,,,,,"Some people say that in our modern world, dominated by science and technology and industrialisation, there is no longer a place for dreaming and imagination. What is your opinion?","
To my mind, it is not quite true that nowadays there is no longer a place for dreaming and imagination. Although I agree that our modern life is dominated by science, technology and industrialisation, I think people still have their dreams. Imagination even helps us to survive in our 'industrial' world. Our dreams are as ever much better than our reality. One should always have a hope for something good, something romantic. That's the reason why all over the world melodramatic films and books are so popular, especially among women. Sometimes these films and books are improbable and so primitive that everybody sees the usual 'happy end' with the wedding from the very beginning. But nevertheless women like to read these books, to watch these films because there a woman finds the realisation of her own dreams, of something she had imagined lots of times before and now she can see it in 'reality'.
Actually, I think that here we deal with human potential ability to dream and imagine and with efforts that a person makes for his dreams to come true. Imagination gives us a power of creation. Not all of us, of course, have great imagination and even less can express it. It's a gift of God when you can write, paint or create music because you should be very talented to make all your dreams come true, so that other people would also believe in them. Great writers, artists and composers often live in their dreams, their imagination creates a new reality for them and their readers, listeners and spectators. But I think that all of us create a small new individual world for ourselves, but not all of us would let somebody see our own world.
Real life is not like our dreams. Usually we think about our work, about money we need. Our life now depends on science, technology and industrialisation. Their products help us a lot, they make it easier to work, they bring comfort to our homes. But benefits of modern technology have also a bad side. We become dependent on computers, on the 'artificial intellect'. We prefer to solve our problems with the help of technology, not using our own brains. Of course, one may say that computers are man-made machines, that lots of great scientists have to think, imagine and work for these machines' production but there are millions of users who don't care how their computer 'comes to life'. They only need it working good and properly so that they won't have any problems. And the answer to this question lies in the field of man's imagination. We, people, have our dreams and thoughts, no machine has them. Every man has his own individuality. His imagination can be great or small but still he possesses it. It influences the way he lives, he thinks, he works. We sometimes say about a person that he's 'machine like', but even this person can have his own dreams. They could be primitive or practical but it's just a question of his ability to imagine.
Our 'industrial', 'technological' life is full of stresses. People get tired of their work. For example, you are working at some factory standing all day long at the conveyer. You move automatically every day, you don't think. Very soon you begin to feel as if you were part of this conveyer. This monotonous work makes you sick, you don't want to be a machine. Your soul and your imagination need feelings and emotions. And you turn to something that was created by somebody else's imagination (of course, your imagination can also create but as I've already said not all of us are talented enough to express it). A lot of people love drama and they often go to different theatres to get an emotional supply there. Some of us prefer to go to different kinds of concerts and listen to music. Or, probably, one would buy a ticket to some comedy show or circus. Tastes differ. Our imagination prompts us where to go. It helps to find a way out of our stresses, it gives us hope for better future. No matter how 'technological' or 'industrial' life is there is always a place for dreaming and imagination. At least I believe in it.

RUMO2014,3.0,,,,,,"Some people say that in our modern world, dominated by science and technology and industrialisation, there is no longer a place for dreaming and imagination. What is your opinion?","
In my opinion, the place of dreams and imagination in the modern world is that of creator in reference to his creation or that of king in his kingdom. For what is the constant source of human mind's eternal trouble and unrest but imagination? What other power inspires us to search for all sorts of new conveniences and devices to satisfy our exquisite tastes, providing the mind with hundreds of splendid ideas about what else can be done to give pleasure to one's body and soul? Who would refuse the man who dared to accept possibility of electricity a considerable amount of imagination?
One probably wouldn't even think of inventing a steam-engine if the ever-lasting human dream of moving as fast as the wind was not always present in our mind. It is not easy to find an argument against the statement , that the speed of wind can hardly be considered as one of the indispensable necessities of human survival. But, curiously enough, it was always tempting to imagine oneself to be in the place of someone or something else, as the wind or a bird, as the case may be; and, going still further, to calculate the possible consequences of this rather doubtful position as if it were a stated fact or an easily achieved prospect. No doubt, we think, there mast be some way of embodying these wonderful suppositions and enjoying the overwhelming possibilities thus suggested.
At any rate, it seems inevitable to assume that the act of imagining some possibility comes before any mental or spiritual discovery. And this is not the only valuable possession that dreams and imagination provide us with. Speaking about dreams, no one can deny that the attribute 'beautiful' is one of the most frequently attached to the word; and beauty is a notion of a particular interest and importance for the modern world, despite all science technology and industrialisation. In fact, to a less superficial eye, there is no less obvious idea as that of opposition between beauty and usefulness, which was generally recognised by many people not so long ago. For what can be more useful for a modern citizen than beauty? Unfortunately, nothing else seems to be capable of saving him from feeling frustrated and lost in this horizontal world of ours, which we inherited from the romantic XIX-th century, with no heavens above and no hell below. It is especially nowadays that the aesthetic criteria seem to make their way into people's mind and dominate their choice to a great extent. At least, that is what the course of development of advertising production over the last two decades has shown most clearly. Of course, the questions of national survival, such as those of the possibility of nuclear war, seem to be too serious to be decided on these futile grounds. But who knows what factor was the first to influence public opinion in this respect, for one can hardly imagine an abstract picture of elimination of a nation ( if it is at all possible to imagine that one does not exist), but the horrible picture of devastated land which immediately arises in mind, and gives a thorough idea of anti-beautiful, is more than enough to form one's opinion on this score. To sum up the point, it no longer looks doubtful that dreams and imagination are an indispensable property of modern civilisation; and if it doesn't have a place in the world, it is only for the reason that is always goes a step ahead of all the rest.

RUMO2020,2.5,2.5,,,,,Most university degrees are theoretical and do not prepare students for the real world. They are therefore of very little value,"
The problem of the university degrees can be viewed differently. There are certainly some people who consider high education degree to be useless in the sense of its actual practical use. I myself do not agree with this statement. I think that education is one of the most important parts of our lives. It is the basis of the person's whole life. Education gives a person a better appreciation of such fields as art, literature, history, human relations, and science, it is intended to help young people indentify, choose and prepare for a career, it helps people enjoy richer, more meaningful lives. Unfortunately nowadays a great number of the universities appeared in our country that do not provide their students with the actual, valuable education, but I am rather optimistic as far as this situation is concerned. I think that such institutions will soon cease to exist being really useless.
The educational system is constantly changing. There are certainly quite a number of problems in this process, some questions have already been solved, others are still to be answered. By way of solving the problems the whole system is developing.
Historically universities developed from the cathedral and monastery schools. Their development took place so slowly that it is difficult to know the point at which they became universities. Thus, the first universities in Europe appeared in the 1100's or may be 1200's. Those universities provided the unified teaching of such disciplines as low, medicine, and theology and they were rather general than specilized. These courses were gradually broadened.
The point used as the title of the present essay perhaps had been discussed time and again by those people who were concerned with the educational system even in the 18th century. If we look closely at the historical development of the university education we will be able to see the reflection of the problem in question. To my mind, a growth of specialization reflects the point in question.
During the 1800 specialization in knowledge was increasing. Many Institutions were created to train students in such fields as agriculture, medicine, engineering, and commerce. Specialization also resulted in an increased emphasis on advanced study. Thus, education for professions overshadowed the liberal arts.
Now everything is changing the other way round. We can see another tendency: most of the educators agree that students need a broad education as a basis for whatever field attracts them.
From my point of view, this basic broad education should be humanitarian.
In our country in 1950's and also in 1970's technical specialization was of primary importance, but humanitarian education did not have any practical value. I do not mean to say of course that technology is not all important. I mean that the real scientists should have and do have broad education.
The word 'humanities' comes from Latin 'homo' - ' human '. Thus humanities study everything that is connected with the human beings, the most important facts in the development of the human civilization. This is the knowledge we should take into consideration!

RUMO2022,3.0,2.5,,,,,All armies should consist entirely of professional soldiers: there is no value in a system of military service,"
Conscription, which simply means compulsory military service, is a very controversial issue. People constantly argue for and against it. Its supporters say that it gives young men a sense of discipline in a world where the young increasingly have too much freedom. They say it helps young men, who perhaps were tied to their mother's apron-strings at home, to stand on their own feet and encourages them to develop initiative, since a young soldier must make his own decisions and cannot rely on his parents to tell him what to do. It is even considered that a boy can become a real man with a strong, tough character who can endure everything and withstand the calamities of our contemporary life only if he was a soldier (even if he didn't have to carry out his duties being a participant of some war-events).
Of course, these reasons are ponderable enough but there exists another, opposite point of view. Opponents of compulsory military service and I myself argue that an army of conscripts is unsatisfactory, amateur one, since one cannot expect reluctant young man to perform war-time duties efficiently after only a year or two of training. A war must be fought by a professional army, and soldiers should all be volunteers.
The latest and the most vivid example is our war in Chechnya. From the very outset I like many other people was against it but it is not the theme of my issue. What I'm talking about is that our army entirely consisted of boys who scarcely finished school. A great part of them couldn't even hold the gun in their hands. No wonder that losses were great. For professional soldiers war-time duty is work which is supposed to be carried precisely and more often than not it is.
Compulsory military service for all young men also causes disruption to the education and careers of the young, since it creates a gap just when they should be strudying or starting work. There is a great deal of examples when boys give up their studies after the army. They are too far from their previous occupations and only a little part of them have a desire to graduate from the university and to get a diploma in order to be a specialist. So we come to a cul-de- sac when we don't have professionals either in army, on the one hand, or in science or other disciplines, on the other.
Finally there is the problem of the young man who is against war on principle. In other words he is a pacifist. I know that in Britain a person who refuses to do military service is called a conscientious objector. If his reasons are accepted, he may be obliged to perfom other, non-military duties but it does not come about if military service is voluntary.

RUMO2023,3.0,3.0,,,,,"In the words of the old song: ""Money is the root of all evil""","
There is no doubt that evil and good are two sides of human nature. And by all means, everyone has some good and bad features. The most important question here is - 'what dominates?'
For instance, if we take Hitler as an example of an evil man, we'll certainly find some deeds of kindness which he had probably accomplished in his life.
As for me, I would say the only good thing he ever did - was the suicide he commited... But we can talk of his ability to love, for instance, he really cared for Eve Brown.
Thus, my starting point is that we all are human beings and by the very nature we are not ideal. Now, if we return to the quotation used in the title of this essay - 'money is the root of all evil' - we shall find out that there are many things to talk about concerning this subject.
Every now and then people wished to possess, whatever their desires were, they can all be united in a frase: 'I want to have this and that', and there can be no exceptions.
Even when a person says: 'I want to be (beautiful, charming, good, etc.)', it is just another way of putting the same thing. The fact is that he or she just wants to have such and such qualities. Many philosophers talk of kindness and generosity, but they, just like religious people, want to achieve their reward in the after-life. There is no one who wouldn't want to possess something. This feeling, the want of possession, is based on our egoistic nature due to which people survive in the most difficult situations. It we didn't have the love for ourselves inside us, we wouldn't be able to survive in this world. Thus, egoism is a natural feeling and one shouldn't be ashamed of it. It is the force which pushes us forward...
People who are in love also wish to have. They would be perfectly happy if the person they love could always be beside them.
But everything can be achieved only by paying for it in one way or another. When people introduced money, it became the most convenient way of payment. To say that 'money is the root of all evil' is just a metaphor. People of all times used money to achieve their goals. This is what could be ( and often was) evil. The metal itself can't do any harm. It is just a mediator. Therefore, the meaning was transferred from the thoughts to the means by which those thoughts were turned into deeds.
Thus, man is the root of all evil and good.

RUMO3001,3.0,4.0,,,,,The prison system is outdated. No civilized society should punish its criminals: it should rehabilitate them,"
It is only lately that our society has reached the conclusion that the prison system in this country is outdated. Now we are having more and more publications on the subject in our press. Here and there we can hear and read that prisoners fight for their rights, demand better conditions for work and life. In other words they simply want to be treated like all other human beings.
As far as conditions of life in prison in this country are concerned they leave very much to be desired. People do not have even elementary conveniences , the quality of their food is awful. There is no need to say that prisoners do not have any possibilities for education. Whereas in many other countries of the world people already long ago came to realise the rehabilitating power of education.
Criminals in prison live according to their own laws where the strongest subordinates those who are weak and cannot do anything in order to defend themselves. Here people at every turn come across violence, cruelty and scorn.
As the result they leave prison being cruel, embittered, intolerant; they are not able to live a normal life again. Without having education they cannot get a good job. And generally speaking they cannot get any job at all because as a rule managers avoid employing such people. Thus, the society itself makes former criminals go in for other crimes. And they in their turn begin to take their revenge on the society.
The situation in children's reformatory schools is even worse because children there are at an impressionable age, they are easily influenced. If an adult can make an effort and resist one's influence over his person, a child is not able to do this, because he simply has got no view of violence and cruelty of his own. As soon as a child is put into prison he immediately grows up. He is not a child any more. Nobody will take care of him but himself ; nobody will bring him up but his surroundings. He does not know that in the outer world people live according to other laws. In reformatory schools children become like animals who have to fight to survive. And it is only the strongest and the most malicious who survives. Unfortunately more often than not their way of life can be easily foretold : they are sure to be put into prison again.
Certainly, on the one hand, these people did a lot of harm to the society or its representatives, but, on the other hand, the reasons for that are different in every case. We should take into consideration that not all criminals commit crimes deliberately. Some of them really realise their guilt and repent of it. They still can change their lives and the society should help them and prevent them from new crimes.

It is a truth universally acknowledged that there is no practice without theory : one must really have some knowledge so as to apply it to whatever he does . The problem which was chosen as a topic for the present essay has been discussed time and again both by teachers and by students, and for the time being it is one of the most essential points at issue . Nowadays, when the problem of education in Russia has become common , we more and more ask ourselves : are we able , after graduating from our universities, to begin to work and earn our living ? Are we really prepared for the real world ? And how important is it and what does it depend on ?
Although today we often say that there is a lack of practice in our studies, we should not underestimate the importance of theory, because unless we know how to thread a needle , we cannot really begin doing it . But here a very important question is bound to arise : how much theory and how much practice must one really have during his years of study and which of them is more important ? If we talk about the profession of teacher of English, for instance , we can admit that six months of practice would be enough for us to begin to work after we graduate . Having tried to work as a teacher for some period of time , we would probably understand that there is hardly any great difficulty that we would not be able to cope with . But if we talk about the profession of a surgeon , who takes upon himself the responsibility for other people's lives , the question of practice acquires special importance .
Here it is practice that comes to the fore . Every doctor - a physician, a dentist, an oculist or whoever it may be, must go through a very long practice to be sure that he is able to help people, to make them healthy and not vice versa . A very big problem in this country now is that there a lot of doctors who think they know their trade, but in practice they turn out to be unschooled, to say the least of it . Unfortunately there are plenty of examples which can serve as a demonstration of it . And the fact that the amount of such good-for-nothing doctors is increasing is still more depressing . Now, when we have to face the fact of paid medical service , this problem becomes extremely acute .
It would be unfair to say that it is only doctors who are unschooled . There are plenty of teachers , journalists, artists, interpreters and others whose knowledge of their business leaves much to be desired . And in most cases, unfortunately, it is the result of bad schooling and lack of practice at the universities they were studying at . A few decades ago , as our grandparents say , the system of university education was much better and university graduates at that time were more prepared for the real world than those of the present day.
I am not , to say the least , an expert , of course , there are others who seem to know a great deal more about the subject than I do. But I would like to raise a few questions : how much depends on the educational system and how much depends on the students' attitude towards their future profession ? Incredibly enough , but today we can meet people who do not want "" to be prepared for the real world "" although very often they have every opportunity to do so . And as the result their university degrees are of very little value .
Still I do not agree that most university degrees are theoretical, though there are demonstrations of the opposite. I think we certainly should do our best to improve our educational system . But still very much depends on the person's attitude towards the ' real world ' and the desire to be helpful and professional .

RUMO3005,3.0,,,,,,"Some people say that in our modern world, dominated by science and technology and industrialisation, there is no longer a place for dreaming and imagination. What is your opinion?","
When Antoine de Saint-Exupry ( 1900-1944 ) wrote his famous "" Le Petit Prince "" ( 1943 ) , the World War Two was at its height. However, this did not prevent him from creating wonderful characters of the Little Prince , who was fond of watching the sunrise when he was upset , of the wise Fox , who taught that it is only the heart that can see the truth and that the most important things cannot be seen by the eyes, and of the narrator who knew for sure that there is a star in the sky where his little friend lives and takes care of a lamb and a beautiful rose . ""Look at the sky. Ask yourself whether that rose is alive or, perhaps, the lamb ate her ? And you will see that everything will change and no adult man will understand how it is important "" People change outwardly , they pretend to look sophisticated, business-like, busy and practical, but at the bottom of their souls they long for peace and calmness, having no idea of how to achieve it .
The irony of human life is that we live in anticipation of something extraordinary, of making new discoveries and of "" having the world and the sky all to ourselves "" . We see life as a battle. We fight, we lose and win, and one day we suddenly realise that all our deeds are in vain, because the world we live in is cruel, unbearable and unfair. ( And strangely we forget to mention that this world does not exist by itself independent of our will and actions ). Thus the time of despair , disillusion and dejection comes . And people long to run away from reality to the Kingdom of Beauty and Poetry, Dreaming and Imagination, to those spheres and realms where the soul could have its rest .
""....For who would bear the whips and scorns of time, Th'oppressor's wrong, the proud man's contumely, The pangs of disprized love, the law's delay, The insolence of office, and the spurns That patient merit of th'unworthy takes....""
It is the greatest error to think that our modern world ( "" dominated by science technology and industrialisation "" ) is particularly deprived of dreaming and imagination, or , in other words, that there is no longer a place for any of them. Were people in Dante's or Shakespeare's time more imaginative ? I doubt that. In fact, it is not a matter of society or a period of time at which one lives, it is a matter of one's own world view . There have always been and still are people who light the way to Heaven , to Poetry and Imagination, who are able to see the unseen, who are not afraid of facing the truth, who know for sure that it is the soul that matters and is eternal .
The conflict between the life of imagination and its ' practical opposite ' , between poetry and prose of life is always there presented in different forms, but it is an integral part of every society.
During the Greek-Percian war the Percians were destroying the beautiful statues of Acropolis, but the Greeks buried them as if they were people. In the Middle ages Dante, Leonardo de Vinci, Boticelly and Petrarka created their masterpieces when the heretics were being burnt on fires. Russia was under the Tartar-Mongolian yoke when Andrey Rublev started painting the icons.
People tend to regard the time they live in as the most difficult, cruel and violent . But if we look at the history of mankind we'll hardly find there any ' golden age ' . Nevertheless people always aspired to the sky, they dreamed and tried to make dreams come true ; they saw a mystery in the obvious and the obvious became a mystery for them. Imagination is the veil through which people see infinity .
I am absolutely convinced that it will be like that for ever , till the end of days, no matter how much our world is going to change .

RUMO3006,3.0,2.5,,,,,All armies should consist entirely of professional soldiers: there is no value in a system of military service,"
I agree with this statement but I would like to present a few points proving the opposite. I will present them one by one in order of importance .
In this country we have a system of military service and most people believe that military service turns or transforms a boy into a man. When somebody swears to be faithful to his native country, he swears to be faithful to his family and his social class too . This oath makes people more confident and faithful. If we reject the military service we reject this oath too. Therefore we have to replace it , but I do not know what with. So, this is the first point, a matter of soul , I would say .
Now I would like to present another point of view on the matter . Any professional army should have its professional military . What is a professional in any sphere of life ? This is a person , who is really interested in what he or she is doing , and is capable of doing this work perfectly well . If he likes to read ' clever ' and foggy books on philosophy which make an average person go crazy and his students mad because of the dullness and dryness of his seminars - he may be a ""professional "" in philology . A professional in the army is another matter . As we put it "" he is a servant of the tsar and a farther of soldiers "" . He must run as a runner , shoot as a shooter and be as caring as a mother . . I made a very pleasant picture , didn't I ? Any professional wants to have a worthy salary and a professional army in general costs much more than an ordinary army on the system of military service . If the state has enough money to keep a professional army, this is wonderful. But if this state is in debt, than a professional army is out of the question . Small salaries are lethal for any army .
And now I would like to present the last and most important point , that should be considered very thoroughly . Now , what is the army ? By definition the army is a group of armed people, that serves to protect its country. The army exists for war only . Soldiers and officers must have an enemy in mind . The orders are not discussed, they are executed . But every soldier has his own brains and inevitably he puts them to work. What is the guilt of Serbs and Croats in former Yugoslavia ? Why are they killing each other ? Russian and American soldiers have the same ideas, I believe . Why should they fight against Serbs and Croats or Moslems ? Why should they be hostages of big politics ? A whole list of questions and no answers . Why not to leave Serbs, Croats and Moslems in their destroyed country ? What goals do we achieve by sending our troops there ?
Do you want the army to be professional ? A set of questions and everyone chooses the answer for oneself .

RUMO3008,3.0,2.0,,,,,"Some people say that in our modern world, dominated by science and technology and industrialisation, there is no longer a place for dreaming and imagination. What is your opinion?","
I believe, the man who first began dreaming was Adam. He 'd dreamt of Eve, and she was given to him. God has created her for him , but in a sense Adam has taken part in this creation. When man had been banished from Eden, the only thing that still distinguished him from other living beings was imagination, this last blessing of Paradise lost.
At first man wasn't conscious of this gift of imagination. The world view of a primitive man was different from that of ours. ' Existing ' has not been opposed to ' imagined '. It was due to lack of imagination about the outer world, and to the fact that the discriminating powers of the human mind were only beginning to develop. Man was perceiving the world as a tangle of interconnected objects, as a globality, the constituent parts of which were profoundly and indissolubly connected.
Then, step by step man became aware of his own existence and of the existence of the world as distinguished from himself. The world became an object of man's contemplation and analysis. Very soon the world began to seem too little and simple for practically unlimited abilities of man's mind. Man couldn't be satisfied with it , and he tried to create a world of its own, where all the images arisen in his mind would find their place. Man knew a horse and he heard strange tales of eastern animals with horns on their noses, and so he created a unicorn. We know very well now about the existence of rhinoceroses , who are not at all unnatural. But we still love to hear old legends about unicorns, because they are something we haven't got in our world, but what man has created by his own power - the power of imagination.
Man really is an image of God, and so he has received an ability of creation.
"" Imagination is subcreation "", - wrote a famous English writer of our century J.R.R. Tolkien. It means that man can produce a kind of "" secondary reality "", where everything that he has imagined would be real and true.
The more familiar the outer world becomes to a man, the more interesting and important for him this "" secondary reality "" turns out to be . Nowadays, when there is hardly an inch of the Earth left that hasn't been most thoroughly examined and investigated , when all the existing things have been systematised, given a proper place and labelled, suddenly a deep longing for something irrational, that cannot be investigated and systematised, has arisen. That is one strong impulse for imagination.
Another one is the development of science as such , however paradoxical it may seem. When man had achieved with the help of new science and technology flying through space , the man's imagination immediately began "" to work "" , and we can see the results very clearly - a great amount of books and films belonging to the so-called ""science fiction "". This is an excellent proof of what has been said above .
Other examples to illustrate my point are on the one hand horror films and books together with the so-called "" fantasy fiction "" ( e. g. books by U. Le Guinn, T.H. White, etc. ), and "" soap operas "" on the other hand. These are also products of dreaming and imagination, but of another kind. If the former are produced by "" active "" , creative imagination, the latter are the results of "" passive "" or "" protective "" imagination. These modern cinderella stories are nothing else than dreams of an average housewife tired of her everyday duties and worries. By dreaming and creating her secondary reality , where it is true and real that poor defenceless girls are sure to meet their princes, handsome, loving and rich, she tries to defend herself from the actual life. She escapes into this secondary reality. That is why I call this kind of imagination passive or protective.
So I believe that in our days imagination and dreaming not only have not vanished , but that their influence on human mind is gradually increasing. Not the lack of imagination could be a danger, but the possibility of the total escape into the secondary reality. It is very important for us not to turn a gift into a trap for ourselves.

RUMO3012,2.5,,,,,,"Some people say that in our modern world, dominated by science and technology and industrialisation, there is no longer a place for dreaming and imagination. What is your opinion?","
Being a student of philological faculty of Lomonosov University, having in the course of lectures those subjects of study that are not considered to be part of science, such as modern and especially English language and literature you are supposed to read a lot. After having been acquainted with the literary works which are on the list, which are recommended by your teachers you would be extremelly surprised by hearing that dreaming and imagination do exist no longer.
All those pieces of writing and art show us use of the imagination. Elaborately arranged in patterns of lines and of sounds, as in poetry, they express thoughts, feelings or human experience in language full of imagination. On the other hand, a writer of fiction by using techniques which are different from those reguired in poetry, inoents people and events. Writers who are good at inventing imaginary things or artistic forms or at producing new ideas are highly esteemed and respected in the society. There is something mysterious in that occupation. We should ask ourselves why serious people devote their lives to empty dreamings, which are really nothing to be cared about. As history tells us many things are written, but few are remembered. And very few ( from;of) poets have built for themselves monuments more durable than brass. They said something which mankind can not forget, though very often their words can not be understood.
It is my favorauble chance of making intelligible convictions of mine concerning the world of dreaming and imapination which to a certain degree is associated by myself with Literature Studying literature, we are learning to become accustomed to a kind thinking which is not the ordinary kind of thinking at all.
To my mind, literature is the whole world which is rather different from the common one. By teaching us, it changes us, makes us from our own convictions and draw our own conclusions which are not similar to the opinions generally held in the society today.
It is thought that our modern world is dominated by science technology and industrialization. This point of view is widely spread(y) nowadays. But I think it is a rather simple-minded approach to the understanding of the world, which does not show maturity and sophistication. For the first sight, it seems to be like childish fears of lightning and thunder.
Being a student of philology you are supposed to form a habit of checking up every unknown and doubtful word in the dictionary. In my Longmau Dictionary of English, languade and culture the verb 'to dominate' has two meanings. And there is some sort of an uncertainty which explanation should be chosen. If we admit the firstone it would mean that our statement would declare that science has the most important place in the modern world that it plays the most important role in the society. In that case I would like to say that there is nothing to argue about, just because it is not true. Half-subconsciously I believe that the second meaning is more suitable for us. In that case the statement about science as dominating and domineering power, controlling life of mankind really sounds very threateningly. It follows that people who think so are frightened. It is common knowledge that fears arise when a person is tired or depressed.
We thout doubt this world is not the right place for people to live together in perfect harnury. Even a thick-skinned person not speaking about people of delicate and subfle nature can suffer the neverending fighting. But what a human being really needs is place, although this world is not the suitable place to find it. Here, I think, literature can help us. I love a lot the words from the novel 'Painted Veil' by my favourite writer Somerset Maughtn 'one cannot find peace in work or in pleasure, in the world or in a convent, but only in one's soul.'
I think, it would be sutable here to notice that in her book 'What is the English we use?' O. S. Ahkmanova refers us to G. H. Vallins.
According to G. H. Vallins 'Literature as distinct from ephemeral writing and officialese, preserves whut is best and most worthy out of the past and hands it on as a living tradition.'
That is why from generation to generation people tell their children fairy tales, buy them beautiful books with many pictures, then send them to school. Children must be able to read and write, be acquainted with what is the most precious which mankind has been accumulated. To my mind literature is able to change a person. I know about myself that I would have been a sort common schoolgirl if I had not read a lot. It is also known about famous poets that more often than not reading awakened their genuis, they tried to imitate and succuded. So it might be said that literature is the salvation and consolation to mankind from evil powers in this world.

RUMO3013,3.0,3.0,,,,,"In the words of the old song: ""Money is the root of all evil""","
I believe it would be very interesting to muse upon the statement 'money is the root of all evil' especially now. It seems to me that for our country this question is gradually becoming more and more urgent. And as for me I feel that now, at the age of 19, it somehow beings to touch me and my life also.
Of course money itself is not the root of all evil, but it is man's cupidity which was so strongly expressed in money and became in many cases the root of evil. It turned out to be that money to some extent was invented to carry out man's desires of accumulation. When it didn't exist nobody I think could even try to have, for example, 10 waggons instead of one. It becomes possible with money's appearance. Man begins to get money and wishes more. So he gets even more than he needs, he has enough to satisfy his vital requirements, but he wants more and justifies himself, rebuilding his requirements. He already begins to get money not for the sake of food, clothes, other things, but for the sake of money itself. This is really awful that there is never too much money. This thirst for money knows no bounds. In such situation man seems to be a rather pathetic creature, absolutely enslaved. He involves himself in a play, a neverending play, and stops to control it.
Let's look at the results of people's passion for money in the world. Those endless wars, numerous murders, betrayals, aspiration for authority are very often manifestations of this passion. For many centuries different states, republics and nations appear and dye, separate and unite because of little groups of people who want to get more money. In our everuday life there are so many quarrels, lack of understanding which lead to hostility and they are also the off-spring of this problem.
I'm not sure that money can make somebody happy. Wise man always spoke about it at all times. In Europe, in America people ( unfortunately they are few) often speak of the tragedy of human nature, of how it is terrible that materialistic values are considered now to be much higher than spiritual ones and so on and so forth. And it is very sad that Russia is eager to be like the West in many respects. Even spiritual goals seem to be an object of sale and purchase. They buy books with gold binding not to read but to demonstrate, disks of the classic music simply for having it. They make their children to study foreigh languages because it is prestigious, supposing rather naively that education also can be bought.
So unfortunately money really takes a very important, supreme part in our life. And we certainly can not talk about freedom in the world until we understand quite well how much evil depends on this role of money.

RUMO4002,3.0,4.0,,,,,"Some people say that in our modern world, dominated by science and technology and industrialisation, there is no longer a place for dreaming and imagination. What is your opinion?","
To begin with I would like to stress that although this topic seemed to be a little bit more acceptable than the others it is still formulated not in the best possible way. What I mean is that the two parts of the statement have no connection between them. It would be the same as to say ""because in spring the sun rises earlier, it is no longer possible to sleep at night"". The title N 14 (as well as the rest of them) sounds very ambiguous.
The high development of technology logically suggests that dreaming and imagination will be even motivated for it presupposes the arrival of more objects to dream about. A lot of people dream about cars, computers, TVsets, etc. and certainly in this case you can very well employ your imagination.
The others probably wanted to say that technological Revolution has caused revolution in the style and quality of life. Different tools and instruments have been designed to make our life easier. In fact it has been growing into an obsession over the last centuries. Now the problem is not in doing things, but in doing them quicker and in an easier way.
The idea of quickness has changed the minds of people. They want to grasp as much as possible from their lives not only concerning their careers but their possessions, even dogs (especially in Moscow) and holidays. For example, they want to visit as many countries as possible disregarding their lack of interest in these countries. While rushing their ways through lives they forget about their neighbours and friends. People stop caring for others being obsessed with the only passion to accumulate as much of experience of this or that kind as possible. They are ruthless to each other being unable and unwilling to understand their neighbour's psychology, his problems and sufferings. They can't even understand their own psychology, and can't interpret their own dreams. By the way, the last quality disappeared because it was no longer needed. We really don't need imagination of this kind. We have computers to think for us and TVsets to compensate for the lack of imagination. A Scottish psychiatrist R. D. Laing said that ""with the arrival of science and technology, and a subsequent obsession to adhere to the unquestionable values of Efficiency, Economy and Neutrality, we have forgotten what ""ends"" we were pursuing"".
Never was science and technology developing so quickly as in this century. And never, as far as our civilisation is concerned, a man came so close to self-destruction. Our ""civilised"" end has already been calculated and we know for sure that our world will be blown up in the future. I would like to point out that in the XVII, XVIII century people believed in the development and civilisation a great deal more. There were no similar ideas about the resources being extinguished and pollution being able to kill us all. Only Christians believed in the End of the World. Nowadays even those who don't believe in God will have no doubts about this question. Just think of the degree of this pessimism, we known that all our development and achievements have no future.
And never there has been a century comparable to this one with regard to cruelty. Two major wars, Fascism and Stalinism, and much more that happened in the XX century. There never was anything like that in the past centuries. The inquisition would be regarded as children's game to be compared with what we've experienced.

RUMO4003,3.0,,,,,,The prison system is outdated. No civilized society should punish its criminals: it should rehabilitate them,"
Thou shall not kill Arthur Hugh Clough The Latest Decalogue The society must protect people from cruelty, all of them, including criminals. And we must remember the words from the Bible: ""... He that is without sin among you, let hum first cast a stone at her"".
But, as everybody knows, the prison system is the severe condensation of cruelty, evil and injustice on the one hand, and on the other - it is a rare case that the punishment fits the crime. The thing is that savagery can produce only savagery and nothing else, and neither shame nor physical pain has any other effect than a hardening one.
While being in jail a prisoner must not be humiliated but rehabilitated.
The society must prevent not only itself from a criminal, but also prevent a criminal from further mistakes. Imprisonment is not a vengeance, it's a reforming. The society has to give a helping hand to someone who stumbled. and there's no difference between a criminal who is killing and one who is making decisions to send others to kill. It is exactly the same thing, or even worse, as far as capital punishment is concerned. Fifteen years in prison can have a sobering effect on even the hardest criminal. As it is said in the Bible: ""Let him that stole steal no more: but rather let him labour working with his hands the thing which is good, that he may have to give to him that needeth"". The punishment of the spiritual mode is usually much more indecent and dangerous than a corporal punishment. Because the pain has the quality ""if prolonged it cannot be severe, and if severe it cannot be prolonged"".
One must not forget that it may happen that he will take place of the man on the dock. One always has an air of someone who is lying when speaking to a policeman. As Cardinal Richelieu said: ""If you give me six lines written by the most honest man, I will find something in them to hang him"". All of us have done those things we ought not to have done, but let us not leave undone those things which we ought to have done. We should better find out and heal the roots of crime. Harshness is setting in many schools. The number of your criminals is growing. In the view of some psychiatrists juveniles are apt to commit the most senseless crimes for reasons adults find outrageous. The minds of young people are overwhelmed with movies where violence dominates. And people live in fear of crime. The law alone won't stop crime but it is an important step in the right direction. As a British politician Edmund Burke said:"" There is, however, a limit at which forbearance ceases to be a virtue.""
The problem of cruelty and crime is of vital importance especially for Russia as it takes the first place in the world prison league. The second belongs to the United states.

The 20-th century... We can't but give it its due. From the very beginning up to the end this time represents a great progress of mankind in all fields. It is literally overwhelmed by discoveries, historical events that are really worth putting down in history. In fact all the preceding centuries' contribution in the development of man power is incomparably less than the one made during this particular period. There is no need to enumerate a great number of names of people who made it possible to fly into space, to have such a good helper as a personal computer, to create real miracles in the fields of chemistry, biology and many other sciences.
So the 20-th century... It is not over yet but in my estimation in advance of time limits. As is known the time influences upon a man, changes him. Nowadays this dependence is especially actual and obvious because the tempo of industrialisation of life is too fast. It penetrates into the most spheres of modern society. But a man never can be a robot, though sometimes he has to come up to this invisible edge between a man and a machine, but it is too dangerous. The point is that his brain is an open system, ready to imbibe everything new. Moreover there are some fields which will always remain vitally important. For instance - human relations. When there is a lack of them, a man gets tired of life much faster, and when such facts take place he may simply destroy himself, commit a SUICIDE.
That's why everything concerning human nature needs directly is sacred and inviolable. People engaged in the sphere of entertainment and show-business have always taken it into consideration. A man is the only being enjoying soul. This abstract notion, the poets sang the praise of for ages, is naughty and hard to predict. Nevertheless it is the main feature differing a man from animals.
Let us try to follow the flight of human fantasy. All the modern inventions and achievements were born in this super computer called human mind. When the civilisation were in rudimentary state and later at the feudal time imagination was the screen reflecting all human thoughts. In the beginning all the great things were nothing more than dreams. Some of them a man made come true, some still wait for their realisation. That's why dreaming is a necessary step in all undertakings. It represents a model, maybe a very primitive one but still no less important. Also dreaming, is like a vent that helps us to escape reality for a while. Every man has his own dreamland ""but not everybody is eager to go a long way which begins in our mind. Only a rather lucky man manages to realise his ambitions, but ""God helps them who help themselves"". That's why strong will, and first of all, firm belief in our own dreamland is the key to survival in such a crazy world like ours.

What is money?
Let us turn our view to the dictionary. Money are coins stamped from metal, printed note, given and accepted when you buy or sell something. Somebody has much money and somebody is absolutely broke.
Why do people think that money usually spoils mankind? Look around!
Let's take for an example our country. The appearance of ""new Russians"" has given a terrible imprint on common people, who lead a quiet life, earn their living at establishments and have both ends met.
Visit different kinds of shops and supermarkets and you will be shocked by variety of very expensive goods there. And only rich people can afford it. You can see the eyes of the children, who want to have such beautiful toys, which are too expensive for their parents.
You pass by the restaurants and think: ""My God, how expensive it's to eat in these restaurants, night clubs and get pleasure there.
Money spoils either those who have much or those who are in need of it.
Money, money, money.
Money governs our thoughts, minds, turns our steps to make rash actions.
Money kills people. You remember the death of Vlad Listiev and there was much gossip around his death. And some people thought that his death was connected with money. Human life, which is considered to be God's gift, also depends on money.
Many girls who want to have beautiful dresses, jewellery are looking for a rich man not paying attention to human being feelings. Some of them become prostitutes. It boggles. Nowadays money is an awful monster. In order to get much money people betray each other. Mass media tells us that much more hired killers show up today. And for $ 10 000 they do their job perfectly.
Pay your attention to the children. They give up studying at school to earn money; they wash cars, sell newspapers or sometimes they are just poor beggars. Their parents can't afford to buy them even a bar of chocolate.
In conclusion, I'd like to speak about conflicts, which appear because of the money. The lack of money, I think sometimes influences relations in the family, but it's just a small part of all troubles, which the person meets on his way. Many crimes are not revealed, because rich people can buy out the freedom for killers.
People who have much money have the global power.
Wars and political conflicts happen because of money. Some people want to rule the whole world. Of course, you know the war in Chechnya. Nobody in the Russian government can solve this problem in Chechnya and find a peaceful solution.
Terrorism is growing, nobody cares about it, nobody can help. Criminals use this situation just to earn money. They sell guns to terrorists.
When two countries fight with each other, the government of these countries pay for it at the expense of common people. Do you agree with me?
So, to my mind, money is really the root of all evil.

He just showed off. He wanted to be strong and do a lot in his life. Being on the street could he do that? Could he dream of a high education, mastering a trade or applying for a job. He couldn't. It was easier for him to steal things. He stole everything, everything which could be stolen. I don't think that he became happier after buying VCR machine, drinking a six-pack a day, shelling out his money like mad. He was the same weak guy, but then 15 - year old guy, who had some problems with his lungs. Doctors said he had asthma. He understood that pretty well. Did he care? Sometimes yes. When he was choking and couldn't reach for his medication. In Russia winters are severe. So that's why Russians wear those fur hats which cover not only your head but also your neck, your ears and most of your face. He was cool. He didn't want to wear any hats. He was proving to everybody he was strong, healthy and competent. But his weak head cracked. His head couldn't bear that frost that - 31'C temperature. He was rushed to the hospital and he needed some surgery. The next day he was operated on. But something got wrong during the operation. And he was partly paralysed. He couldn't move his left arm and left leg. Every day he was given a lot of medications and couldn't breathe because of his asthma. It was spring then. Then summer came. He was released and went to his gramps to live in a country house.
There was nothing for him to do in town. There was nobody to speak to him.
He died on a quiet morning in the fall. He was only 16 years old. He was greatly deceived.
Sorry I didn't write about his crimes, his rapes, his drug-selling, his wrongdoing That's not the point.

RUMO4012,3.0,3.0,,,,,"Some people say that in our modern world, dominated by science and technology and industrialisation, there is no longer a place for dreaming and imagination. What is your opinion?","
On the basis of my life experience I'd like to remark that the ability of a person to dream and imagine is determined by: first, the level of his education; secondly, the kind of his activity; thirdly, by his material condition; fourthly, by his upbringing and education, or better to say, cultural backgrounds and fifthly, by the hereditary factor.
The higher the level of education is, the larger totality of knowledge a person has; so he can discuss more phenomena and other things. A modern person, who possesses a higher level of education in comparison with a person of the Middle Ages, has a broader informational base for his fantasy.
The kind of activity of a person greatly influences his ability to imagine and dream. It is established by the medical research that a person who is engaged in monotonous work for a long period of time (for example, the work at the conveyor) loses the ability to imagine and dream creatively, for such kind of work requires great attention, concentration and leaves no place for a process of thinking.
On the other hand, in our modern society quite a lot of people are engaged in such kind of activity which is closely connected with the intensified brain work. For example, schoolchildren, students, engineers, scientific workers, physicians, teachers, artists, politicians, economists, managers, etc. It is determined by practice that the higher the level of industrialisation and development of technology in the society is, the less quantity of people is engaged in mechanical monotonous work and the greater quantity of people is occupied with the creative work.
Consequently, it is possible to make the conclusion that in our modern society more people have opportunities to dream and imagine during the work-day on the professional level.
The material condition of people greatly influences the ability of a person to think creatively too. When a person is constantly preoccupied with the necessity to feed and dress his children, his family, he doesn't have any opportunity to get the good education himself and let his children get it. He has no time for rest and he has to spend all his time and strength on seeking the necessary means to provide for his family. Certainly, such a person has no time and opportunities to dream and imagine.
On the contrary, when a person possesses a certain income, can allow himself to feed well, can give his children a good education, can have a good rest, he has far more opportunities for a creative approach to different problems. The modern industrialised society (Western Europe and USA) provides its citizens with rather high level of life and social support for ""not well-to-do"" people, in such a way it allows the majority of people to manifest their abilities to dream and imagine. The ability to dream and imagine is innate but it should be developed.
The social environment where a person is grown and brought up is significant in development of his abilities to dream and imagine. It is known that it is easier for the majority of people to acquire knowledge in their young age. A person who was surrounded by talented and intelligent people in his childhood, easily acquires experience of creative thinking. The ability of a person to dream and imagine requires constant improvement and persistent training. It's not by chance that those people often achieve success in life whose upbringing and education allowed to get profound experience of creative thinking. We can often observe such examples: the children of actors become actors themselves, the children of composers - become composers, the children of scientists become scientists, etc. The industrialists society with a highly developed technology allows practically to every person to enlarge extremely his informational base and to obtain the necessary experience of the process of creative work since early childhood. All the people in the world are different. And their creative abilities are different. As a human being is a part of nature, he is to obey the laws of nature. One of such laws is the law of natural selection. The people who possess better creative abilities, have more chances to survive in the modern world, give a healthy posterity and provide it with high levelled education. As far as the society and its industrialisation develops, the above mentioned law of natural selection functions, the quantity of people that have the inborn ability to dream and imagine increases. By the way, that is one of the reasons of the development of the humanity progress by accelerating tempos.
Coming to the conclusion, I'd like to sum up and say, that I don't agree with this statement. The higher the level of development of science, technology and industrialisation is, the more opportunities for dreaming and imagination people have, and so the more chances to realise these opportunities.

RUMO4014,3.0,4.0,,,,,"Some people say that in our modern world, dominated by science and technology and industrialisation, there is no longer a place for dreaming and imagination. What is your opinion?","
One of the modern Russian poets wrote: ""...          ...""
I think he is right to some extent. We spend our life in vain, because we lack many important things, and we do not understand it, as from the day we are born we are offered a certain substitute, created by our modern civilisation. And as philosophy suggests, culture is over when civilisation comes. We remember that Leo Tolstoy called to give up civilisation and to be closer to nature.
Technological progress ""dries out"", emaciates our souls. It is no mere chance that a lot of people think that people in highly developed countries are boring. Their creative potential is very low, their cultural life is slack, they have no imagination, their children lag behind the children of some other countries as far as their mental development is concerned. They are not interested in life, they have no questions, because all the answers are already given. Everything is already given to them by the radio, television, computers, and so on. Children play computer games which are very interesting, colourful, but most of them make an automate out of a child. Those children do not want to read books, and that is a problem, since reading develops imagination. There cannot be any better thing than a book for developing a child's imagination.
If we take music, for example, we will see that all these modern synthesising machines do not leave any place for imagination, because everything is already insinuated. Every sound from the sound of the explosion of an atomic bomb to the sound of a child crying can be found in one row of keys. Of course, it makes our life easier, but the life sound disappears. It is no more natural.
That is one thing which prevents us from dreaming and using our imagination. Another thing is information. Nowadays we get too much information, we cannot cope with it, we cannot cope with the information that pours upon us from everywhere. Our mind gets tired, it cannot work anything out. The place that belongs to imagination and dreaming is taken by some external information.
We all are used to the following phrase: ""Every person is a unique individual"", but unfortunately nowadays these ""individuals"" more and more look like one another. That is due to technological progress that stamps the people. They have the same way of thinking, they behave in the same way. Those people who come to big cities from the provinces, from the depths of the country, are of a much greater value as far as their creative potential is concerned, because they bear no stamp of civilisation. At first they feel awkward, become flustered, but then their strong nature prevails and they demonstrate their individuality in everything. They can see what is not seen by us, their actions are often unexpected. That is why Moscow drama schools welcome young people from the provinces so much.
It is not mere chance that a lot of talented writers, artists try to ""escape"" from big cities with the purpose of creating something, they try to escape from the vanity of vanities. The best masterpieces were created somewhere far from the centres of civilisation. Comfort, which is the result of the technological progress, somehow calms us down, lulls us.
But the lack of comfort is baneful too. If we do not have these things our thoughts are occupied by the desire to have them. Having them becomes the limit of our dreaminess. And when we finally get them we are already too tired to strive for anything else.
Still, the matter is not so simple, because we cannot and we should not stop the technological development. Despite all the above mentioned people are always the same. A person of the 15th century and a person of the 20th century have the same nature. Nowadays we know more, we live longer, but still there are a lot of things left for us to discover. The best poems and novels are not written yet, the best pictures are not painted yet.
Nowadays with science technology and industrialisation it is even easier to realise one's potential. Everyone is given his chance. Our world outlook becomes wider and wider, therefore the horizon of our dreaminess becomes broader. But unfortunately there is a dangerous tendency which aims to rob us of our dreaminess. It is connected with new computer programmes and modern inventions called ""virtual reality"". It is no more a thing from the science fiction. Such things do exist. A person does not have to dream any more, the dream is given to him, somebody's dream is given to him.
So we can only hope that the strong human nature will prevail and will win a victory over the technological progress. As for me, I am sure of it.

RUMO4016,3.0,3.5,,,,,"In the words of the old song: ""Money is the root of all evil""","
Money has been considered to be evil at all times. There were wars, murders, robberies, maladies because of money.
I would like to consider the problem of money in the view of contemporary world. It seems to me that possessing extra money is the beginning of any conflict: political, economical, spiritual. During the wars people producing weapons got a great deal of money. At the same time they did not care about destruction, death, sorrow it brought.
People so that to get money committed different crimes, even killed their close relatives to get inheritance, for instance. Most murders were committed because of mercenary aims.
Most people think that everything can be bought for money including love. That is why some young girls, without having experienced a genuine love, prefer sex for money. Prostitution has as its consequences terrible diseases, moral decay, family conflicts.
People who get money easily, spend it to get their own pleasure without caring about their health and other people's health.
One of the global problems of mankind is drug abuse. Drugs cost a lot of money. So that to buy them people commit crimes. Those who sell drugs are rich people indeed, and they do not care about the fate of those who buy them, although buyers can be their own children.
For instance, in the present-day society there appeared a great number of the so-called ""new Russians "" who can afford absolutely everything. Young people try to imitate the new Russians. Some years ago children dreamed to become doctors and teachers. Now they are eager to become new Russians. Girls tend to marry such rich men; they want to be wealthy. Nowadays girls prefer marriages of convenience.
There exist young people ( and there is a great many of them ) who do not want to enter institutions and universities but instead they start trading, without doing any good to the society.
The best brains in our country are bought for money and immigrate abroad,sell their discoveries and inventions instead of serving their own country.
Great sportsmen having achieved success in their own country, go away to play for foreign teams and clubs. Instead of working as trainers in their own countries, instead of bringing up their own young generations, they give all their energy and talent to the foreign states.
The same situation concerns art. Instead of paying good money to their own actors, instead of developing cinema, theatre the new businessmen spend money on foreign video-production; they invite foreign singers and actors, organise night clubs in which young people do not get aesthetic upbringing.
These young people start imitating their idols, but many of them are drug addicts or alcoholics.
And I would like to give one more reason to prove that money is the root of all evil.
There are people who kill animals, and by doing it they earn much money, without caring that some kinds of animals and birds are going to disappear. These kinds of animals are protected by law but these people do not pay any attention to it. Besides they do not obey the law, they do not think about the future of our world. Because of the problems of the ecology there is a threat to the existence of the whole mankind.
There also exist people who destroy forests, build factories and plants which pollute environment by smoke and so on. They grudge money on purifying air and water. We should remember that mankind may perish because of such a careless attitude to nature.
So if all evil in the world happens because of money, I suppose, money is the root of it.

RUMO4017,2.5,2.5,,,,,Feminists have done more harm to the cause of women than good,"
Feminism is a phenomenon, which together with television, cinema, numerous flights into the space characterises our crazy 20th century.
Feminism, what is it actually? It is the struggle of women for their rights the dictionary informs us. So at first sight there is no harm in it. Let's have a brief look at the history of its development.
The end of the 19th century - women are bored and tired of sitting at home, knitting, washing , bringing their children up and waiting for their husbands who spend all their time at offices earning for the living. It is not a very cheerful picture, is it? And who will judge poor women for their innocent desire to vary their monotonous lives a little?
What do we observe now, just several decades later? Women study at universities together with men, they wear the same clothes, take an active part in politics, they go in for sports, they even fly into the space.
They are likely to have achieved everything they dreamed about.
But amazingly they do not stop. They dug deeper and found things which they called "" discrimination "" and "" sexism"".
A man opens a door before a woman and she is insulted. She can do it herself, she does not also let him pay for her at the restaurant. She earns enough to do it herself. There will be millions of such examples. And finally what do we have now? Men treat us as if we were men. They forgot what it is to be a gentleman.
The relations between men and women became simply like in the stone age. And when some women who are far from the idea of feminism try to protest men always have a ready answer: "" But you wanted it yourselves "" .
I think that the cause of feminism gave us, women, a lot, but today it has gone too far. There must not be extremes - that is a golden rule. Unfortunately feminists do not understand it , as they do not understand how ridiculous they and their ideas are.
"" We are no worse than men. We want to have everything men have.""
That's a phrase frequently used by them. And gradually they become like men: very rude and not elegant at all.
I don't know about the others, but I want to be a woman, and I want to feel in the presence of men. And I am absolutely sure that most of today's women do not want to have anything in common with today's feminists, who, probably, are establishing the 3rd class now.
So let them fight for their ideas, but don't let's us, women, be taken by them.

RUMO4018,4.0,3.5,,,,,"In his novel ""Animal Farm"" George Orwell wrote ""All men are equal but some are more equal than others"". How true is this today?","
The problem of equality has been discussed time and again by different people, in different books and different situations. But it still remains unsolved, for the very word 'equality' can be understood in different ways. For example, the rights of men and women in Western countries are supposed to be equal. What does it mean? It means that everyone independent of his or her sex has the same opportunity in choosing a job, getting education, getting married, being retired, etc. But at the same time in this country a woman has never been and will never be elected as a president, I suppose, or it is a very rare fact to meet a woman as a director of a bank or plant, for instance. It happens not because a woman is really not as clever or energetic as a man, but for a simple reason that she is a woman.
Another example of such 'equality' is obvious if we turn to the relationship between a husband and a wife. Not many of women can boast that their only duties are to bring up children and keep her house. The largest part of them have to work, because the salary of her husband is often not enough for living, so a woman has to earn money as well as her husband. But she still remains a mother and a wife, so she can not allow herself to sit in front of TV in the evening after her work. She is also supposed to organise cooking, washing, cleaning the flat - in other words do all the domestic work. While a man often seems to be very tired after a heavy day and 'has all the rights' to spend his free time as he wants. So how can we talk about equality if the things like this are frequent in our life?
The points talked above were mainly concerned with the rights of men and women, so they were based on the difference in sex, but the same happens to people of different social position. In this case let us turn to children from families of different social levels. It is not a rare fact that a child, whose family is not well off, is really very gifted and clever, but he has no opportunity to get a good education and be a specialist or a professional in a particular field; he has to attend an average school and it is also very difficult for him to develop the gifts he received from God. Whereas for the children from the families of the higher levels of the society such problems do not exist. From the very birth every their step is planned, they have all the possibilities to enter any University they want and choose any job they want.
There is also a problem of elderly people. Sometimes it happens that they want or have to work, but they can not find a job because of their age. They can be good specialists, even professionals, but all the ways for them are closed. That is enough just to look at the advertisements which in most cases announce: ""...women or men not elder than 35 are wanted"", everything becomes obvious.
In the conclusion we can agree that the words ""All men are equal; but some are more equal than others"" are really very actual nowadays.

RUMO4019,3.5,3.0,,,,,All armies should consist entirely of professional soldiers: there is no value in a system of military service,"
What makes one nation (or group of men) ready to fight another nation (or another group of men)? Answer: a conflict of interests, or a clash of life-shaping ideas, or one nation's belief that it is in blood and bone superior to the rest. Have those causes disappeared from the face of the earth? Of course they have not. Which form of military service is more effective - this question remains now as crucial as it was fifty or one hundred years ago, in the days of most brutal battles.
At first sight, the answer to this question seems to be quite evident. There are two basic options. The first is compulsory military service. The second is hired troops, i. e. army of professionals. To become an expert in any field takes time. There can be no doubt that a skilled professional soldier who has operated a tank or an armoured carrier for five or ten years will do it much better than a soldier whose service term totals only six months or one year. It follows that the former will have more chances to perform his task successfully and finally to survive on the battlefield and to defeat his enemy.
There is another merit of professional army. It concerns a problem of maintenance of order among the ranks. It is generally known that it is rather difficult to keep discipline exclusively by means of punishment which is the only (unfortunately not so effective) means in the system of compulsory military service. An experience of the army of the United States of America is very significant in this respect. Soon after the system of hired troops had been issued all the problems with discipline were resolved mainly with the aid of a system of fines. That result could not be achieved only by means of summary punishment.
The situation in the Soviet Army was quite different. No methods could force Soviet soldiers to serve properly. Mutual hatred was in the usual run of things. As a result thousands of soldiers have been murdered by their colleagues every year. Private soldiers were occupied mainly with building of houses or doing up a territory of their military unit. Hence it follows that they could do everything except fighting. Practically the Russian army has not changed since then. And consequences are fateful. The inability of the federal Russian army with an estimated 100.000 soldiers to contain, let alone defeat, Chechen guerrillas thought to number fewer than 10.000 (the moral aspect of that military campaign has to be discussed separately) and the humiliating defeats which the Chechens inflicted on government forces in 1995 have moved the President and his administration to talk about acceleration of military reforms.
It would seem that the advantages of the professional system are clear. Why then such countries as Germany, Sweden, Denmark and Norway do not cancel the system of military service? The reason is that military service in those states is a matter of ideology. The facts of war in Vietnam when American soldiers that signed a contract refused to attack enemies, pleading lack of promised fruit juices and ice-cream, are very well known.
Suvorov, the Russian general who lost none of his 70 battles, said: ""More conveniences, less courage"". It looks as if Germans and Scandinavians agree with him. They say: ""A soldier must discharge his duty to his country; military service is not a chance to earn money"".
So it is difficult to choose between professional and compulsory systems. People have the only hope. There are reasons to think that 21st century could be a a more relaxed period for nations than 20th century. Only diplomatic rather than military means will solve any conflict.

RUMO4021,3.0,,,,,,Most university degrees are theoretical and do not prepare students for the real world. They are therefore of very little value,"
If we open any newspaper and look at the job opportunities column we will immediately notice that the main requirement for any more or less serious occupation is a university degree. Sometimes even the subject in which the degree was conferred is not specified. This appears to be the first and the simplest argument in favour of university degrees in general.
But let us first answer the question, what is the reason for such a limitation? There are plenty of young people who do not, for some reason or other, study at universities, but get their professional experience only by practice.
For example, one can become a good computer-engineer without studying computer science at university. Such people are quite often very good specialists and they can no doubt compete with the university graduates. But if we look more closely into the matter, we will see that university studies give young people a great number of advantages. Firstly, the pay for the work of their ""uneducated"" competitors will always be lower ( the point that can hardly be ignored) and, secondly, the knowledge of the subject will be much more narrow than that of the university students.
An ideal student should learn as much as possible in his field of study, but university education gives him the opportunity to get acquainted with the neighbouring subjects as well. This allows him to find interesting, non-standard solutions in the different kinds of situations. Apart from that students learn to think logically, to write essays and papers, to speak in public. All these skills are considered to be of great importance in the modern world.
It is true that while studying at universities students get mostly theoretical knowledge which they either can or can not put into practice afterwards. But in actual fact there is no contradiction between theory and practice, for every theory is provided with examples and one could never become very good at practice unless he has an idea of the theoretical side of the matter in question.
Unfortunately most theoretical courses do not include up-to-date information on the subject. (This has always been one of the greatest problems of Soviet education institutions. Today the Russian universities lack modern equipment and latest scientific publications). Students would not have to face a lot of things that are completely new to them only if they decide to continue their studies as postgraduates and after that stay at the university as lecturers or teachers. But if the former students choose some other occupation they must be prepared to learn something new every day and practice different skills they had never heard of at the university, in other words to acquire proficiency.
University studies should therefore be considered a kind of introduction to the professional progress or a kind of foundation on which a building of professionalism can be erected with the help of experience. It is impossible to become a doctor without studying medicine at university. Thank God!

Is there still place for dreaming and imagination in our modern world?
Some people say, that in the present-day world, dominated by science technology and industrialisation, there is no longer a place for dreaming and imagination. This statement seems true for many contemporary societies, especially in the Western countries, where the development of technology has reached a very high level. Everywhere they go, people are surrounded with various types of electronic equipment, computers, technical devices. Machines do all kinds of things for us: they cook our food, wash our clothes, talk to us, amuse us, inform us, count, read and write. Our children prefer computer games to playing with each other. There are less and less things left that we have to do ourselves. Sometimes even thinking is done for us by machines. It is not surprising, therefore, that people become lazy in their minds and souls.
Many societies, especially in the countries of well developed industry, enjoy a high level of economic production. Unfortunately, the psychology of people in these countries becomes that of a consumer. Financial security and material well-being are things that many people dream of in the first place. It is no surprise, that people become more pragmatic, more concerned with their future career. Since the competition on job markets is very high these days and there exists a real threat of unemployment, young people have to think more about professional orientation than about romantic relationships, for example. They want to receive good education, so that they could make more money in the future, have nice house, a fast car and be able to buy what they want. They choose their major not according to their inclinations and liking, but according to the chances of finding a good job that pays well. Also, one has to work very hard to be successful in one's field, so not too much time is left for dreaming or creativity. It seems that nowadays we have not dreams, but objectives.
Nevertheless, the picture should not appear so gloomy. Though what has been said above is true, still it would be wrong to say that people in the modern world have stopped dreaming and that there is no place left for imagination. Dreaming is very important, if not essential, part of human nature. It is absolutely impossible for people to live without imagining things, without illusions. We are always searching for ideal to make our life meaningful and complete. Human mind and human soul can not deal with the hardships of life all the time. One should give oneself a break and escape from severe reality once in a while. People are seldom satisfied with what they have and keep imagining a better life.
There can be no doubt that dreaming and imagination still occupy an important place in our lives - but they are taking different forms now. These days, as ever before, people try to convey their innermost hopes and dreams in creative work. If we take even a brief look at the modern art - the books, that have been written in the last decades, the paintings, music and theatres of the recent years - we will immediately see, that they reflect the work of imagination of modern people, their desperate search of ideal and beauty.
The same refers to the cinema - a relatively young artistic genre, which has become so popular today, that it is definitely taking over all other kinds of art. Its immense popularity is to a great degree due to the fact, that cinema, like no other art, creates an illusion of reality and allows our imagination to work without limits. Any most impossible and fantastic situation you could dream of - a trip to the past on the time-machine or a dangerous expedition to Africa, a flight to Mars on a spaceship or an encounter with vampires - everything is possible in a movie, just as if it happened with you personally.
Even modern technology itself is used to create new illusions of reality. With the help of computer graphics and the special effects the movies become more and more impressive, as well as more and more things that before we could only see in our most unrealistic dreams, now become ""real"" and we can see them with our own eyes. To say nothing about computer games, which give you a chance to be whoever you like and do whatever you choose to do.
In all times and ages people created some imaginary worlds to be opposed to the everyday routine, the worlds, where their most precious dreams could come true. Therefore, it doesn't really matter if it is sixteenth, nineteenth or twentieth century - people will keep dreaming and there will always be a place for imagination in this world.

RUMO4026,3.5,3.5,,,,,"Some people say that in our modern world, dominated by science and technology and industrialisation, there is no longer a place for dreaming and imagination. What is your opinion?","
As for me - I totally disagree with this statement. First of all I think that a human being cannot live without imagination. Fantasy, our ability to dream is, probably, the most significant thing that differs people from all the other creatures. True, without imagination humankind will not become monkeys again; but people would cease being people in the proper sense of the word. They would turn into robots, callous machines... Not for nothing in Zamiatin's novel ""We"" the state, in order to suppress the disobedient mechanisms, deprived the people of fantasy.
In fact, a human being doesn't need much in order to keep living (to eat, to sleep, to have a roof over one's head...). But culture - in order to exist and to develop needs ""excesses"" (like literature, music and ""dissertation about the Latin pronunciation in the higher institutes of learning in Southern Italy XII century"" - from H. Hesse), for culture itself is an ""excess"".
Humankind can only develop with the help of the creative ability of a man. And this ability is indissolubly connected with imagination.
But it doesn't mean to say that technology and imagination, fantasy cannot exist together. On the contrary the development of the technology urges the imagination forward. Earlier, when the world was not yet explained so well by the scientists, a man used his imagination so that he could explain nature, all the unknown and strange phenomena (storms, rains, lightnings, etc.). And people invited gods, wood-goblins, water-sprites and mermaids.
Now we know the causes of the physical effects and natural phenomena. And it seems that there is no more place for wonders in this world. This is not true. People need wonders. And, instead of the old, explained ones they keep on thinking of the new, a hundred times more mystical and shocking. And technology becomes part of these new tales and legends (like ""Terminator"" for example). The Earth is quite investigated and developed, - people immediately begin to dream of the opening up of new planets and outer space.
The development of science and technology gave the powerful urge to such a comparatively new ""branch"" of fiction as science fiction. All these robots, machines, super-modern technologies - what a scope for imagination! The more elaborated becomes the technique, the more excelled becomes the fantasy of the writers.
It has been clearly explained and proved, that there is no life after death, and there is no such thing as a soul... But there is something in the human nature that resists, objects to this rational, materialistic view of the world. That is why all sorts of spiritualistic seances and mediums became a stable part of our lives.
We know that the atmospheric pressure affects our health. But it is so boring to live in the world where everything is so simple and understandable. And we begin to search for the invisible, irrational connections between different things and phenomena. That is why all kinds of the astrological forecasts became so popular among people...
I am absolutely convinced that people will never stop dreaming. The world, our life full of disappointment, worries and sorrows is constantly pressing on us and sometimes one really needs to rest, to forget all the troubles - to seek oblivion ( temporal, of course) - that is when people begin to dream. And very often dreams become our only consolation - but how powerful they are! Our fantasy, our dreams give us strength and stimulus to live and to create.
Modern technology can make our life more and more comfortable and secure, but no comfort or convenience will ever replace the imagination. People always want and dream of more than they have (in the broadest sense of the word).

RUMO4028,3.0,3.0,,,,,The prison system is outdated. No civilized society should punish its criminals: it should rehabilitate them,"
Is the prison system really outdated? For me it seems to be a doubtful statement . On the one hand it sounds very seductive: the freedom and equality for all human beings in the world. But this confirmation appears to be a rather turgid theory when one applies it to practice. I mean to say that when we come across a real crime, a subconscious voice immediately appeals to our common sense: ""Criminals must be punished"".
But both of these notions prove to be superficial in practice. And it wouldn't be mistaken to say that any particular case requires special considering. Different circumstances may bring a person to committing crime. Some people are put in such living (or other) conditions that crime is the only way-out when survival is threatened. And then the question which is bound to arise is, who is to be punished: the criminal or the people (or maybe the government), that put him into such position. But certainly I am not going to decide global problems here, to criticise the government or to give them my recommendations, as I hope that there exist a number of people, who (being experts in this field) are much better at this kind of activity, than I am.
Sometimes even one meeting with experienced psychologist may prevent a crime. And I have a strong belief that juvenile offenders should never be sent to prison or some other institutions of that kind. Staying among other criminals makes irreparable harm to the young people.
But in spite of these human ideas, considering human psychology, we should keep in mind that total freedom from punishment can bring the mankind unforeseen consequences. There should exist some restraining ""device"" in the world. Here prisons can be compared with the nuclear weapon: it is a property of civilised countries, which is not being used, but at the present time this is the only tool by means of which World Wars are prevented. Unfortunately people haven't yet invented anything less perilous.
Turning to the fiction we will find no prison only in utopia, in that self-sufficient society where all people have everything they need, so there is absolutely no reason for crime.
To summarise what has been brooded over I need to say, that however sad it may sound, the prisons must not be abolished. But in every case of committing a crime there should be a much more careful personal approach to the criminal.
But the question keeps being open and it is up to the mankind to solve it.

RUMO4029,3.0,3.0,,,,,Feminists have done more harm to the cause of women than good,"
We have to face the fact that the problem of woman's place in modern society is one of the most serious today.
The question which is bound to arise here is whether nesting at home or launching a career is the most challenging option for a modern woman. It is the women's movement (feminism) that struggles for recognition of the claims of women for rights equal to those possessed by men. Feminists achieved great success in the last century. The founding aims of the women's movement - equal job opportunities, reproductive choice, equal pay and freedom from sexual abuse are now supported by many women who might not identify themselves as feminists.
On the other hand, many people claim that feminists have done more harm to the cause of women than good and women's movement has proved to be women's worst enemy. Women are told they are unhappy, because feminism has gone too far, giving them more independence than they can handle and wrecking their relationships with men. Behind the celebration of women's victory, behind the news, that the struggle for women's rights is won, another message flashes.
A woman may be free and equal, nevertheless she may be miserable.
It is pointed out by many critics of feminism that women are unhappy precisely because they are free. Women are enslaved by their own liberation. They have gained control over their fertility, only to lose it. They have pursued their own professional dreams and lost out the greatest female dream - the dream about a family.
Women's liberation has given the new generation high incomes, the option of single parenthood, free love in return it has effectively robbed them of one thing upon which the happiness of most women rests - men.
One can hardly deny all these facts but my point of view on this matter is entirely different I believe that many women are unhappy not because feminism has failed; the true cause of their misery is that feminism hasn't gone far enough.
In the 80s Mrs Thatcher stated categorically: "" Women's fight for equality has largely been won. Women can enrol in any university, join any firm, apply for credit at any bank "" Men and women are equal. This reminds me of the famous statement made by George Orwell: "" All men are equal: but some are more equal than others"".
First of all let's consider the job opportunities. In the UK there are still only 44 women members of Parliament out of 650 MPs. In the USA There are only 2 female governors the same number as in the 30S.
Next comes equal pay. An average working woman, in both the UK and the US, still earns only just over two-thirds of what men do for the same work. Nor do women enjoy equality in their own homes, where they still shoulder 70 percent of the household duties. A woman is supposed to do all domestic chores: to cook meals and wash dishes, to do the laundry, to vacuum the rooms and do the shopping. Men think that housework is a garbage work. Men feel offended when they are offered to shore the housework: they believe that it is degrading and humiliating for people of their intelligence.
Moral standards for men and women are far from being equal. If a woman is not married, she is supposed to live a good clean virginal life. She is not supposed to have lovers, to have affairs, although for a man it is quite natural. Men don't admit that sexually women are very much like them.

RUMO5002,3.0,2.5,,,,,Feminists have done more harm to the cause of women than good,"
We have to face the fact that feminists have caused a lot of harm both to the society and the women's liberation movement, to the whole idea of women's liberation.
First and foremost, we should try to understand how it happened that men and women had found themselves ""on the two separate sides of the fence"". It seems to me that it is all due to feminists.
Feminists believe that they fight for equal opportunities with men. But what have they managed to achieve since they began fighting?
Men smile widely when they are asked to respect women's aspiration to have the same jobs and wages as they do. Because of the feminists' behaviour and their tricks men regard the idea of women's liberation as a very amusing one - and nothing more.
Men do not seem to think much of women's abilities. May be, that is because they see only funny nervous persons, who are not satisfied with the way they live, and these strange persons fight for women's rights. Many of those, who call themselves feminists are rude and fussy, and they do not have the slightest idea of real feminism, which is always ""pure and never simple"". But what we see now, is just a simplification of feminism.
Let's look into the matter of the feminists' ""achievements"" now.
Women all over the world can get any job - if they work hard.
It is not true in all the cases, but in many cases it is true. But if a woman managed to get a good job it is very often due to a man, who has hired her, helped her and who has let her dreams come true, because men are not as cruel and stupid as feminists consider them to be. And what is more, men are always glad to let women be equal to them as far as the question who will pay a bill in a restaurant is concerned. There are the cases when men spoiled by feminists, invite women to a restaurant, eat and disappear in order to give women a chance to be equal with them. Men who give seats to women in a bus died out like dinosaurs. They even are afraid of looking ridiculous and their motto is ""To die, but not to give up"". This is all fruit of many years labour of feminists. Who could imagine such situations a century ago, when there were not so many people involved into the movement! But I would like to return to feminists' ""achievements"". As we all know now, feminists hate compliments and hate people paying them compliments. And now we are told pleasant things more and more seldom. ""Haven't you noticed any thing? I have had my hair cut! - Oh, do not worry, your hair will grow again soon"". Such conversations have become part and parcel of our associating with men. But they adore to give us some pieces of advice, like: ""You'd better go in for sports - I don't want you to put on weight"", etc. I can't tell anything about feminists, but I believe, many ordinary women prefer being payed compliments - and they are fed up of such advice.
Men consider women to be equal with them but not in the cases we would like them to do. Men who have listened to feminists' speeches on TV, on the radio for a long time cannot treat women like princesses, but only like good chaps.
And another important point is to be made: those women, who really want to be equal with men don't speak about it too much and never make so much fuss about it, because they just do not have enough time. They abandon themselves to work and do their best to work as men do and even better, to achieve the results the men achieve. And they do not attract others' attention by their strange actions. That is all because they know: who but feminists assured men of their being stronger than women, although feminists wanted to do the reverse. It were feminists to build this fence between men and women by talking about it all the time.

RUMO5004,3.0,,,,,,All armies should consist entirely of professional soldiers: there is no value in a system of military service,"
Life in the whole world has changed radically during the last several decades. Discoveries and technical improvements influenced it greatly. In this day and age most countries pay more attention to its inhabitants and their prosperity instead of thinking of conquering other territories. More positive outlooks were adopted/ People ceased to treat other races as their enemy/ Such acts as Vietnam war and bombardment of Hiroshima and Nagasaki seem to be practically impossible nowadays. Political and economic course of the majority of the countries is based on the development of friendly relationships between nations. Danger of the global war was minimized. Nevertheless army still occupies an important position in the life of society. As for me I do not know any more or less big country which at all.
Practically in every army there exist a military service. And only small proportion of countries has professional army. I would like to concern the military service in this work. Let me cite the Russian one as an example.
According to law every young man over the age of 18 has to go into the army and serve there during 2 years ( an exception is made of those who have physical or intellectual shortcoming ). And here the first disadvantage of the system comes. The boys have to leave their families, friends, jobs; have to give up many things they used to do before. They are practically torn from their everyday life and forced to do something they often do not want to do. What is more, army life is not easy at all. Such fact as 'Dedovshina' is not a secret anymore. Some soldiers suffer from the cruelty of other ones and from that of officers. Even our state oppresses soldiers using them as a free manpower.
Mothers are afraid of sending sons onto the army and do their best to 'save' them from it. And here illegal business prospers: doctors and lawyers can do anything you want if you pay them.
The situation is complicated by wars. The war between Russia and Chechna is a very good example of this kind.
Young soldiers who had just joined the army, who even did not know how to fire, were sent to Chechna. These boys who sometimes hated any weapon and violence and could have been afraid of death were sent to kill their compatriots, to destroy towns. They had to struggle for the goal they could hardly believe in. And moreover those young people who had just begun to live were very often killed in Chechna. Mothers lost their sons, society lost its members who could have done good to it, but were forced to go into the army and were killed there.
All the above-mentioned facts can lead to decay of the whole military system in this country. Of course, men should be acquainted with the system of defense, just in case. Undoubtedly, they should be taught all these things somewhere, but not in the army.
As far as the army is concerned it must consist entirely of professional soldiers, who love their job. They must, beyond any doubt, be taught at military academies. The most important thing about this is that they should become soldiers at their own will. Only then the army should be respected.
I suppose that this problem needs its solution badly. Army is very important nowadays therefore government should pay more attention to it. The system of military service must be abolished gradually and professional army should take its place as soon as possible.

RUMO5006,3.0,3.0,,,,,All armies should consist entirely of professional soldiers: there is no value in a system of military service,"
It is indisputable that a state needs a strong , efficient army , which is well paid and respected by the people. In most countries the military service is rather an honoured and prestigious business . Until quiet recently the service in the army was prestigious enough in our country as well . But during the last ten years the wave of antimilitary movements arose and this negative tendency is not going to abate . Such an unfavourable relationship tawrd the military service turned out of several factors . First of all it is the whole state of affairs in the army which does not rule out the possibility of moral humiliation and physical abuse , the aggravation of health or even the death of the servicemen . As another very important factor we can consider the wars with Afghanistan and Chechnya . And , at last , our system of military service takes up an enormous part of federal budget to the detriment of education , culture and science .
The best way to check fighting efficiency of the army is war .The war with Chechnya showed that huge , badly managed and weakly educated Russian army built on the undivided authority system can not wage a local war effectively . Still more the result of different sociological researches show that more than 70 per cent of servicemen think that their subunits can't carry out a set task .
The bridge - head , raws of beds in the barracks , the severe daily timetable and the orders which are beyond the discussion - these are the attributes of the army in any state . And among all these there is a human being , an individual . And the following questions arise naturally : is it possible to correlate the stable principle of undivided authority in the army with another stable principle - with the priority of the individuals rights ? Is it possible to obey the order without the feeling that you are restricted in your rights ?
The lacks of obligatory military service are obvious . Many people think that the best way out of this situation is a professional army . Actually the fact of existence of professional army means that all servicemen are specially trained and educated , which causes the higher fighting efficiency . Also it means that the army consists only of those people who are fit for such kind of activity and , besides ,like it . (A lot has already been said about those people , whoes lives and been ruined because of the obligatory military service ) .
Nowadays our government is working at the military reform . Let's hope that some changes shall be made in the whole system of military forces ; and people whose persuasions , physical and psychological abilities don't allow them to serve in the army , will not be forced to do it .

Some people say , that in our modern world , dominated by science , technology and industrialisation , there is no longer a place for dreaming and imagination .
I am disagree with such opinion . From my point of view , nothing can prevent a person , who has imagination , to use it . I would like to mention , that any idea or invention , even in the sphere of science and technology is a product of one's imagination .
But even if we will not take everything , concerning science into account , there is a great field for one's creative activity and thinking .
For example , it is difficult to look clearly at 20th century and see it as people will a hundred years after our days . We are still too close to it .
The imagination of the painters of 20th century gave lifes to many interesting ideas by means of their works : cubists (Publo Picasso and Georges Braque) tried to show their subjects as though they could be seen from several points at the same time . All the different planes shown made them look as though they were composed of little cubes .The Cubists also rejected the Impressionist colours and worked mainly in browns and greys . Picasso's painting continued to change and develope after his Cubist phase .
The growing science of phisiology was largely responsible for the movement in art called Surrealism . The works of Freud at the beggining of the century was echoed in the paintings of Max Ernst .
The Expressionist painters , beginning with Van Gogh , needed to express their personal reactions to the confusing world around them , their personal dreams . If to speak of Marc Chagal's paintings , I would say that they are dream-like . I would even better call them 'fantasies' , not paintings .
So , in our modern world we can find a lot of gifted people .
For example , people used , use and will use their imagination and their dreams in music : not only when composing it , but also when listening to it . Igor Stravinsky , Sergei Procofiev , Dmitriy Shostakovich , Maurrice Ravel and many others - they did not simply use their dreams in their works . Each of their works was a Dream itself .
Some composers of our age have become interested in entirely new ways of creating sounds , for example , by the use of electronics . Some have even had music programmed by computers , which raised the question of whether or not it is truely creative work , and therefore true art . But I think , that any piece of music has inside it a piece of one's soul ; the perfect set of sounds does not have it , when it is composed by some electronics . Music is a kind of communication between souls ; even the most 'clever' computer does not have one .
The same is with ballet or any other kind of dancing . There is to be a kind of communication between the souls of people . Every movement of dancer's hand , leg , even of his or her eyes are very important . It can not be done by computer ; soulless machine can not make people cry or laugh .Some dancers , such as Rudolf Nuriev , have a power over people . That is because he had a great imagination : he did not act during his dance - he lived .
So I am sure , that there is every chance that in 2041 theatergoers will be enjoying an authentic production of 'Giselle' to celebrate its 200th birthday .
The world of art is closely connected with imagination , because without it art is impossible . Art is the making or doing almost everything , which depends on a degree of personal skill and talent . In this way judo , riding a bicycle , swimming or making model aircraft might each be thought of as an art .
In order to paint a picture , or carve an image out of stone , or compose a music work , the artist needs to be able to see what he is doing . Each human being has his own view on the world around him .
I feel sorry about the people , who think m, that there is no longer a place for dreaming and imagination in our modern world .It means , from my point of view , that they do non have any imagination at all . Pity things !

RUMO5012,3.5,3.0,,,,,"Some people say that in our modern world, dominated by science and technology and industrialisation, there is no longer a place for dreaming and imagination. What is your opinion?","
In modern world the role of science and industrialization is really very important, because our life is based on these things: we can't live without television, hot water, canalisation and even wihout such far away anf magic things as space, because the quality of our TV programmes, for example, depends on the work of satellits. But this doesn't mean that there is no place for dreaming and imagination.
The scientific progress is also a plot of imagination, because such people as Newton or Leonardo da Vinci could hardly think out something new without the work of imagination.
The other thing which is also very important is that our modern world is full of art. New buildings are created, new books are written, new films are produced. All these things are closely connected with dreaming. Some people could say that modern art is not an art at all, because, for example, the new versions of old plays sometimes seem strange and simply bad, but they nevertheless have a right to live. And without dicsussing the quality of such plays we can't say that they are not the works of art. May be being a little bit unusual, the works of modern art need even more imagination to understand them, than the old ones. For example, the famous picture by K.Malevitch ""The Black Square"". You need all your imagination not to see simply a black spot. The same is true of modern plays. They are no longer the reflection of the life. they are in most cases the synthesis of music, dance and drama. The synthetic forms of art are very popular. Even in the literature we can find examples of different genres brought together.
In modern American literature ther is a very good example of this kind. I mean the works of Richard Bach. They are both fairy-tales and philosophical essays. They help us in dealing with other people and teach us to think. These boooks are full of dreaming and imagination, although they seem to be very realistic.
You may say that all that I'm writing about does not exist, but it is not a livibg organism, but few pieces left from the beautiiful world of last centuries. But here is the example of synthesis between scientific technology and dreaming. what I mean is ""virtual reality"". This is a real world of imagination and your inner-mind. You may llive iin this world and people would say that you don't depend on the reallity. And this means that you being the mamber of modern society live in the world of dreams.
But speaking about the problem of dreaming and imagination in the modern world we can not say that it is not in danger. The middle level of TV, video and music production is so low that we can see only violence and ugly faces on the screens of our Tvsets. And this is dangerous mainly for children, because they are forced to watch this till the time they begin to understand the difference and the necessity of making the choice every time they watch a film or a TV programme.

RUMO5013,3.0,2.5,,,,,Most university degrees are theoretical and do not prepare students for the real world. They are therefore of very little value,"
The point which is raised in the title is rather important and needs a peculiar attention. There are many opinions about it and I would like to present mine.
I do not think that our education is purely theoretical . Of course, every separate firm has its own demands and it is impossible to predict all of them. Everything depends on a personal ability to adjust to a new situation. The university gives us the theoretical basis and the main devices of our future profession. In some universities, however, it is done in an outdated way.
""Language is not taught, it is learned."" The moto of our department can also be refered to every skill or science. The higher education gives us the theoretical basis, the rest depends on our ability to communicate and grasp the changes. If you are not creative and energetic, nothing even the most contemporary and practical course of your speciality won't help you.
It would be much more worse if the university made from us the specialists competent only to one narrow sphere (as it used to be with our parents). Thus, we would know firmly where to go after graduating, but have no choice. It is not always good, because we do not learn to adjust and to change our working place if it is necessary.
When we enter the department which appeals to us we have very vague idea (and sometimes no idea at all) about what we are going to do in the future. The aim of the higher education is to suggest this idea and not to deprive us of choice. As for me I prefered the Philological Department to the other universities where the language is taught (the linguistical University, the Pedagogical University) because their speciality is too narrow. Their students are prepared to be teachers through the whole life and nothing more. I did not want it.
After graduating from our department our profession is what is called ""free"". Let me show to you some ""vacancies"" which are appopriate for us. I would dispose them according to the level of prestige from the lowest to the highest one. (You should remember, it is my own opinion that can be not right).
A school teacher A secretary in a firm A university teacher A translator The latter is the most highly paid, but the least creative, you act like an automat. I think the work of secretary keeps you always tense, you have too many superiors and are responsible and guilty of everything. If you are independent enough and want to take part in a common business, you can not do without conflicts. The profession of teacher is much more interesting but unfortunately in our country is not paid well now.
But the situation with us is not so hopeless as it could seem. In our job we can combine different professions. Our education, broad enough, allows us to do it.
For instanse we can establish our own business of publishing and printing. We study the economy to know the laws of market. If we consider our course insufficient we can attend the lectures of the Economical Department. It is one more advantage of our University. Over last five years the higher education has become more practical and allows an active and creative person to find his place in life.
I would like to contradict the statement which is taken for the title of this essay. It was invented by those who have spent their university years only studying what they are to study (nothig more!) without deep penetration or just drinking beer, dansing and talking with their groupmates. So now we must take care about our future and try to find an interesting and highly paid job. All depends on our energy and brains.

When we think about the concept of money the first idea that occurs to us is the great variety of opportunities that it might give us, and the second idea that comes to our mind is the fact that money has to be earned so that it could give you a pleasure of realizing that it is your own. Although it is very nice then money falls on you from the sky, I mean those rather rare cases when person gets money without any effort. I think that money helps a lot in understanding people's characters, if you want to know a person better you should look how he or she spends his or her money. For example, those people, who like to spend money not even thinking if the thing that they are buying is worth its price, mostly are the generous people. They like to enjoy life and they want to others as happy as they are. Unfortunately this kind of attitude towards money is rather an exception than a rule, because the most of people are rather stingy not only with money but also with their feelings, they do not like to waste them on things and people that they find unworthy.
Having a big sum of money we can do many good as well as bad deeds, because as the people differ so do their goals which their money serves. One being well off would like to give his money on a charity, to poor and sick people while another would hire a professional killer to murder his competitor. Unfortunately the second way of investing money becomes more popular nowadays. I am sure that money can change the world in a better place but on the other hand it can make it worse depending in what hands the money would be. Actually the most frequent reason for wars and quarrels is money, but in the same time by means of money peace can be established.
Actually most people think of money as a good thing and this attitude is quite understandable. All people want to be rewarded for all the work they do, and this state of things is only natural and just, but there exist such people whose one and only aim is making money. They think that their goal is worth any devices, they would do everything to become more prosperous, they would forget about their own families, love and even their soul in order to increase their income. Their own feelings and the feelings of others are not at all important for them, the value of people's lives they are weighing in money. They do believe that it is possible to buy everything for money including people and their feelings such as friendship, love, devotion, honesty, etc. And here they are greatly mistaken because these are the components of the immaterial invaluable world of people's relationships and spiritual connections.
And there is no such a money that is worth a happy smile and kind look.

RUMO5023,3.0,2.0,,,,,"In the words of the old song: ""Money is the root of all evil""","
Our world is full of contrasts. Its diversity is one of the main mechanisms that keep our society in a constant state of development. People struggle to climb higher on the social ladder trying to acquire more wealth. They do so, without realizing that by unwritten laws that exist in our society: the more some gain, the more others lose. And the more wealth is involved, the more fierce is the struggle.
From the very beginning of our lives, before we learn how to walk or produce meaningful sounds, we realize that some things are better than others. On the dawn of civilization, when a prehistoric man was yet unaware of complex economic laws of barter, he/she new that a mammoth skin would worth more than that of a hare. With time barter became an important part of man's life, but there was a problem. It was quite complicated (and sometimes even impossible) to carry around goods that were meant for barter. Thus money was created to help a man in his/her daily life and make it easier. But the handy economic tool created for good of the whole mankind has been initiating, very often, many evil understandings. It has gradually made many people believe that money is the root of all evil.
Speaking about this, I allow myself a little digression from the main topic of my discussion. A preacher of one of the religious Protestant sects with its headquarters in Texas, even used this argument to teach Bible. In his regular appearances on TV he used to address his viewers in a following manner: Money is the root of all evil. Get rid of evil. Send me your money and I'll pray to God to save your souls.
To say that money is the root of all evil is as much a mistake, as to say that all politicians are crooks. To put all the blame on money would be just another terrible overgeneralization, a lousy attempt to avoid an acute social problemthe problem of relationships between human beings in the society. First of all, it should be made clear what or evil. Others might try to take more loans from the banks, thus forcing themselves yet into even deeper economic pit, since it takes quite a sizable amount of money, nowadays, to keep one's living standard money is. Money is nothing more than just the most accepted means of economic barter. Thus, there should be no problem in money as such. The problem occurs when a person who works hard and earns money can no longer balance his account, when he is no longer capable of paying up his bills and forced into debt. It does not matter whose fault it is his/her own or the government's, the fact is the consequences are sad. Some people in such situation would steal and commit crime at a reasonable level.
Another factor which aggravates the situation very much is the above mentioned diversity of our society, where we have some people living in poverty, while some throw their money about. Of course, not every affluential person would behave in such a vulgar manner. There is no doubt, as well, that everybody whose budget is tight would commit a crime. People are different but it is up to them to find a common language and solve the problem of economic diversity for mutual benefit. It is the man who invented money. It is the man who is the root of all evil. It is the man who has to put an end to this evil.

It helps to take away stress if we enjoy life as it is. People with rich inward lives, who have the ability to think creatively, are happier than others. A romantic writer of the 19th century Herlderlin said: .
Even in the 19th century people began to estrange themselves from nature. They became more and more busy. Then they moved to towns with large factories, with all conveniences and forgot about nature. They did not realize what they were doing. Only poets and writers felt what a painful loss it was, because nature and imagination are inseparable. They go hand in hand. While contemplating the beauty of nature and listening to the sounds of birds, wind and water, man is absorbed in dreaming and imagination. Different associations appear in his mind. He is full of inward of inward energy, he is uplifted.
In daily routine man often forgets about dreaming and imagination. Do they help him to get on in the modern world? I think, they don't. To succeed in life you should be ambitious, business-like, purposeful, indifferent to others' joys and sorrows. These qualities are of great value nowadays and they have nothing in common with dreaming and imagination.
A daydreamer has little control over his life. Chaos is his natural habitat. He hates discipline and he is frightened of it. He has no ambitions and his abilities remain untested and dreams unfulfilled. He is waiting for the time when his dreams will come true. He can not regulate his life. He is not adapted to the modern way of living.
Such people want to live in their own imaginary worlds. Sometimes they use drugs to get there. They use narcotics for pleasure or to remove anxiety. Gradually it becomes a necessity of their existence. In a twinkling of an eye they turn into drug addicts. They think that it is the only way to run away from boring reality.
Technology goes ahead. New industries have developed during the last few decades. People are surrounded by modern conveniences but they are not happy. Why is it so? Maybe they have no time for dreaming. Their life is poor without beautiful images from the world of imagination.

RUMO5028,3.0,3.5,3.5,4.0,3.0,2.0,"Some people say that in our modern world, dominated by science and technology and industrialisation, there is no longer a place for dreaming and imagination. What is your opinion?","
It is not true that in our modern world, dominated by science technology and industrialisation, there is no place for dreaming and imagination. During its history humanity has become and will become wiser (of course, maybe it is only my dream but I hope that it is so or what for have our ancestors made there mistakes?) and our dreams and all fruits of our imagination should also become wiser, kinder and more humane. But people are different and their dreams are different too, and here we should speak about scientific dreams, artistic dreams and everyday dreams.
Once upon a time people lived without all those achievements of civilisation. And the brightest of the ancient people dreamed of sailing to other countries, of flying to the stars, they tried to imagine the constitution of the universe, and those dreams led to a strong desire of investigating the world, of studying the laws of the nature. People began to develop various sciences: geography, physics, astronomy, etc. People began working hard to turn their dreams into reality. But unfortunately some people began to use the scientific achievements of romantic dreamers for their own goals. So some beautiful dreams turned to be very harmful for the civilisation ( here I mean gun powder, nuclear energy, etc.). Scientists began to realise that they should be very careful with their ideas and they should think not only of turning their dreams into reality but also of the after-effects of their achievements which sometimes do more harm than good for humanity.
As far as artistic people are concerned it is their life to dream and to imagine. According to Sigmund Freud the most of such people try to attain in the art the goals which they can not attain in their private life. So dreaming and imagination become the only way out for them to realise their personality. And it is great that there are such people because otherwise we could not admire all those wonderful works of art: beautiful pictures which help us to see this world brighter, philosophical books which tell us about the history of humanity, about its achievements and its mistakes, delightful music which makes us think over our feelings.
But scientists, who try to make our world more comfortable, and artistic people, who try to make our world brighter, are not the only people who dream. Everybody always dreams and tries to imagine what their future might be: every young girl dreams of meeting her handsome prince, all parents dream of seeing their children happy, ambitious young men dream of a brilliant career, ambitious young women dream of marrying an ambitious young man who has made a brilliant career. And these human dreams do not depend on the level of scientific research.
So, no matter who you are, when or where you live, all of us, even the most pragmatic, dream because to dream is humane.

RUMO5032,3.5,3.0,2.5,,,,All armies should consist entirely of professional soldiers: there is no value in a system of military service,"
The problem of military service has been discussed time and again by all countries all over the world. Army is a vary important part of every single country, and it is the force and defence of the state. It helps to eliminate either foreign or inner conflict. Army is a country support. It is commonly shared that every state has to take care of its army and soldiers and it has to work out thoroughly the whole military system.
In different countries there are different military systems. In the US, for example, there is a system of professional army where people serve for good wages. There they are provided with good living condition and they are always ready to defend their country in a case of necessity, as far as they are specially trained for that.
In many other countries there is a system of obligatory military service. According to this system, all the boys who reach the age of 18 are taken to the army. This date can be put off only a person becomes a student of some college or university. It also can be abolished because of the health condition. But usually you can't avoid army whether you wish to go there or not. Obligatory military service takes place, for instance, in France and also in Russia.
But, as far as this system is concerned, we have to, I think, face the fact it has very many drawbacks to be satisfactory. Taking into confederation the situation in this country, we have to accept that for many young people the Army service turns out to be a very deplorable experience. It can not only change their life, but, as some people say, even destroy it. It is common knowledge that our army system is far from perfect and it needs to be worked out more carefully. Many boys are often not ready to go to the army because of many reasons. They can't be their soft character, their convictions, their not - willingness to go to the army because of their intention to devote the years that military service will take, to the work they are interested in, or simple because they are not ready to face those circumstances they are going to be brought to. But, unfortunately the fact is that they are deprived of choice. They can't choose their destiny and they are obliged, according to the state rules, to do what they must, that is to go to the army.
The greatest problem, although, is that this system does not justify itself even in the cases of emergency, for example, during the battle action when there is a real danger for the young soldiers' lives. In those cases the boys often hold the situation either because they are not professionally trained yet, or they are not much experienced. So they are lost in this circumstances, while the professional soldiers, who consider army to be their job are able to liquidate the conflict much faster and with lass number of casualities ( or without then at all ).
So, as far as my opinion is concerned, I suppose that the army consisting of professional soldiers would be not only convenient for the country ( both for the citizens and for se state ) but also more reliable and safe in the case of danger. When people go to the army they have to realize what they are dealing with and it has to be conformed with their wishes. There has to be a special training before the army itself which will prepare people fore the future military service and will give them the basic knowledge of it. So after passing the exam they are to become real soldiers  by vocation  or at least by their will.
I wouldn't dare to confirm that there is no value at all in system of military service. To my mind, the certain value is in experience that army gives to the person. It teaches people to behave in this or those situations. But still with the system of professional army can be solved by well - organized combat training in high schools and military departments in universities and institutes, as they are known. I am sure, it will give al the necessary knowledge of the army and war, sufficient to the person who is not going to devote his ( or her ) life to it.
So, my final thought is that all armies should consist entirely of professional soldiers, who will be able to operate properly in situation dangerous to the country and its citizens. And, I think, such professional army will be a great support and a reliable defence for the state.

There is no limit to the power of the human mind. Little explanation do we have of the depths of the mind which bring us down to the still less known or understood domain of the subconscious. It is the human mind which created the modern world the way it is, which established rules and regulations of the human society, which drew distinctions between moral and immoral and determined the main ethical principles. So, what we have now is a result of our own deeds or intentions, a creation of our mind. Obviously, science and technology play an extremely important role in our lives, but we shouldn't forget that they are only tools that are called to improve and bring to the perfection what has been once created. They are meant to assist us in exploring the limitless maze of the world, help us to penetrate into the secrets of the universe and to find the harmony - the infinite goal of the humanity.
Therefore, the only idea that science and technology may oust dreaming and imagination from our lives, replace LIFE with MACHINERY, stirs in the memory the numerous stories about a monstrous child rising against his parents, a creation demolishing those who brought him into life - like the story of Frankenstein, whose devilish creation turned against himself destroying everything in his way.
These allusions are not mere play on words. After all, what is dreaming and imagination if not the motivating force giving us an impulse, encouraging us to move on, to reach the horizons far ahead, hardly visible? Dreaming opens whole new worlds to us, it lets us see other dimensions, lets us feel the beauty of life, the poetical side of it. Imagination is the origin of Arts and self-expression, it breaks through the existing bounds of common knowledge and gives birth to something new and beautiful. Think of all the things that were once considered a fancy, 'pure imagination', and that now seem so natural and usual to us, known as products of science and technology - I mean TV, radio, various means of communication, computers, etc., let alone thousands of other inventions which are even more common to us now.
One couldn't possibly imagine his life without these things nowadays, and we should definitely give the credit for that to science and technology. I strongly believe, that progress in itself can by no means be harmful to the mankind, it is only the way it is used by the people that can make the difference. Only people can turn achievements in tech and science into a double-edged sword, that cuts both ways. Mass-media can be an excellent means of communication or even an outstanding form of art - and at the same time it can be used to manipulate people's mind, to make us agree to certain ideas and outlooks that a certain powerful element in the society wants us to agree to.
Hence, the question we should be asking is not how bad is the effect of tech & science on our ability to dream and imagine, but how can they be used better to serve our imagination, to reach the ultimate goal.

RUMO5034,3.0,4.0,,,,,"In the words of the old song: ""Money is the root of all evil""","
Everyone of us, I believe, at least once in his life asked himself, or had been asked, about the role money plays in his/her life. I doubt, whether there would be many people who would honestly answer, that they do not care much about money and say, that it brings only sorrow.
We must admit, of course, that history remembers quite a lot of terrible crimes that were committed because of money. People assured themselves that money would make them happy and powerful, and they were not afraid to kill or to steal, in order to get it. Blood flowed, people were dying, towns and even countries had been destroyed, and of course, that bloody money could not bring much happiness to its owners.
But how much good properly used money can bring! I think, now we are becoming wiser about it, although we can not deny that crimes are still being committed. But we must think, what our lives would be like without money? Would the children be able to get proper education? Would the patients be well-treated? Would we be able to enjoy our lives fully?
We also can not deny that in our age of industry, technology and progress we can not do without money which play a vital role in our existence, especially recently, when we have got an opportunity to live our lives as we want.
Some people tend to say, that to think always about how to gain more money is too materialistic, but, to tell the truth, how can we otherwise survive? We have to, I think, face the fact, that we live in the country, where we can not be sure about our future, when we do not know, what is going to happen with us tomorrow- that is why we have to secure ourselves. I do not mean to say, of course, that only money must be our final aim, it is not the only thing one should be ruled by. Its importance and power must be limited, so that it would not turn into an idol, that kills and brings evil.
But if we have a look at all those poor people, pensioners, abandoned children in orphanages, we will see, that their main misfortune-the problem, that is being talked about for so long, is lack of money. Unfortunately, a wish to help is not always enough to solve these painful matter.
We switch on the TV or radio and is it that we hear? We hear that this or that branch of science or industry is lacking money, the institutes, plants are on the edge of collapse, because they do not know where to collapse, because they do not know where to collapse, because they do not know where to find the means to survive.
So how then can money be the root of all evil, if almost everyone can not dispense with it, if it can, and does bring good.
The only thing, that is very often turns to be difficult, is to be able to stop when its needed and do not cross the border of what is permitted. Everything is, actually, in our hands. In is only in our power whether to make money either the source of sorrow and blood, or welfare and pleasure. It's not money that brings in evil; evil had always been brought in by people's lack of restrain and crave for profit. So isn't that a reason to think about ourselves? For in good hands even what before was brought only by sorrow can serve to good.

RUMO5036,3.0,3.5,,,,,All armies should consist entirely of professional soldiers: there is no value in a system of military service,"
The approach to army organization differs, so I will give two examples: the US and Norway.
Since 1970-ies the US army is professional, and during this century there have been no wars fought on their territory. The country participated in both World Wars, but unlike all others, seemed to gain profit out of them. There were also wars in Korea and Vietnam, during which young people would move to Canada in order not to go to the army. I think those wars have embodied the mythological concept of the Frontier, which is now also kept alive by Iraq and Bosnia, only soldiers sent there are professionals.
In Norway military service is very popular among young men. They see the year they have to spend in the army as an excellent opportunity to get some additional education in foreign languages, technology and to earn money. Every weekend they are allowed to go home and the transportation is paid for by the state. Those who declare themselves to be absolutely against war must work in a hospital or a kindergarten for two years for very low wages. Of course, Norwegian boys prefer the army, but do they all realize that in case of invasion or any such thing they will have to kill people, to fight, are they psychologically ready for that?
Some argue that the obligatory military service violates human rights. However, each state, meaning all its citizens wants to be sure that it is safe and well protected. That's why people grudgingly approve of all government defence expenditures. But undoubtedly the professional army is the best a state can have for its money. Even all amnesties usually exclude the mercenaries, as they are much more efficient than unpaid soldiers. They are both much more trained and experienced.
There was also a case I remember about the was in Vietnam. A soldier refused to obey his commander's order.He would not shoot at people who seemed to be civilians to him. That wouldn't happen in a professional army where soldiers know they aren't allowed to think after getting an order.
There are many other professions where people are needed in a society apart from the army. Why don't we oblige all the young men to serve two years in the ambulance, for example? Why teach people obligatory to kill, when we can also teach them to cure, help, teach or whatever? I don't think they would make worse doctors than soldiers. But people prefer to turn to professionals in any other field.
I also think that modern warfare is both unhuman and innatural. Just think of the idea of nuclear weapons used in reply to an American attack that was so popular with Soviet propaganda. Not to leave a place on Earth for people to live was thought to be quite normal. People who are to participate in a modern war should be chosen carefully and trained prefectly for the country to rely on them. In our country, where during the war in Chechnia our army proved itself to be totally inefficient, it is the right time to decide, what kind of army are we going to have and what changes there are to be introduced.

RUMO5039,3.5,2.5,,,,,All armies should consist entirely of professional soldiers: there is no value in a system of military service,"
It is difficult enough to discuss this problem in general because every country has got its own peculiarities. That is why my essay is based only on the Russian reality.
Army has always been a necessary item of the State system. Because the mankind is so unfortunate to have wars from its birth. The original function of the army was to guard the Motherland. The morden armies have a number of new duties. A well-qualified soldier has to know partly a medicine to be a soldier at the war and a guarder at the boundary; he also has to be ready to help people in calamitous situations such as an earthquake or flood, fire or explosion.
Besides that, every year the science develops more intensive than previously and a great number of new technologies appeares. They are connected with computers, mathematics, physics and so on. Presentdays wars are far from infantry battles. It is not enough to be able to keep a gun and shoot sharply at marks. And every branch of the military science presupposes a good capacity because very often your life depends on it.
It seems to me, that it takes more than two years to make this capacity and then the same time to practice it. Our military servise lasts for two years. It means that even the staff, that has been taught leaves the army before practice.
A soldier, who has been learning for a month is doomed to die. For instance, Chechenish war brought grief to many families simply because the boys, just finished the school were shooting marks for professionals. We can also take the war in Afghanistan for example. Some of the boys didn^t make any shot before their death.
I wouldn^t make a discovery by saying that wars are cruel and unnecessary, but they do exist. And if someone tries to wage than every country will have to safe the people from conquerors.
Army has to consist of adult people, who have decided by their own will to become a soldier. This rather complicated decision presupposes a psychological approach and a change of life perception. If you choose such a way of life , you^ll have to be ready to kill. The boys called up to military service haven^t got a choice.
We^ll have to face the fact that we can^t ignore the religious views. The system of our military service leaves much to be desired. It is in confrontation even with the Russian Ortodox Church that has always been an inspirer of all defensive wars. Nevertheless, this problem is not the largest one.
It goes without the saying that sometimes the military service breaks the whole life. Some of the boys lost their possibility to get the Higher education, the others lost their families or girls. A lot of them changed their occupations after the military service.
I^m pretty sure that the most part of men, came back from the real war are ill with the wish of blood. Professional soldiers are killers. That is why everybody should have an opportunaty to decide whether he wants to be a man of such profession or not.
The State can spend the money given to military service for making a really professional army. This process should be soft and graduale. And everything has to be thought over. I hope that some time the army will serve to save people, not to slay them.

RUMO5040,2.5,3.0,,,,,Most university degrees are theoretical and do not prepare students for the real world. They are therefore of very little value,"
The problem of education is one of the greatest interest and importance which recently has been touched upon. It concerns practically everyone. Two thirds of people think of university education; every year there is increadible competition to all universities, but the question which is bound to arise in this connection whether all these people ( both parents and future students) realize the aim of the university studies and the process of it. Everybody wants to enter one of those so-called prestigious faculties bearing in mind the idea of as if it is really possible for a student graduated from one of these departements to have enough knowledge to occupy the 'prestigeous' place in life. But none of the first year students could explane the real goal of his studies in university and the value of his future degree.
So first year students recieve plenty of information which may seem useless because it is so difficult, there are a lot of new terms, notions which are supposed to cover practically the whole sphere of his future studies. And then in further years he just gets a deeper knowledge in a sphere. A student begins to specialize in this or that sphere so that the number of subjects introduced in last year of studies is much less as compare to the first year. And sometimes he is specialized in a subject which may not be connected with his future work 'in the real world'.
Frankly speaking only 25 per cent of the whole amount of information which students recieve in university may be useful to him in future life in the case that he would be going to work in the sphere of his profession.
But here and there they speak of the changes which have already taken place or which should be adduced in order to reform our system of higher education, to make it more practical and useful. And of course every modern programms and systems of education which are presented on all levels ( from the secondary education to the level of university studies) are innovations which are to be praized. But we should distinguish between university education and all other kinds of educations which are offered by colleges, special courses etc.
A person who wants only narrow special knowledge ( instead of university 'universal' one ) in any sphere to work at should choose not the university but some college or courses which offer a number of practical abilities and skills for a particular trend of business. But if a person chooses the university level of education itpresupposes his readiness to the universal number of subjects he is going to study and his ability to acquire this amount of information or even more if he is particularly interested in some subject. And one more remark it is so difficult to find a job for a narrow specialist.
In this connection I want to remember the words of Kozma Prutkov who said that "" specialist is like a gumboil - his developement is one-sided"". It seems to me that all professors who write educational programms think of it and decided to give a student as much information as possible - so they try to make the university programm really unversal. Thus the great amount of information recieved on university lectures and seminars forms a general cultural background which helps a student of linguistics with university degree to communicate more or less freely within some other spheres of science. The information in adjoined spheres may help to solve problems and make conclusions in special sphere.
Probably one more reason which can refute the pragmatic approach to university education it is one of interest. The interest matter is obviously important when we speak of a student devoted to the subject a sphere of science he is going to dedicate his life. Then such kind of student begins to acquire knowledge in history of the sphere, the present state of the art, the existing ideas of further developement. Thus he gradually becomes aware of the subject so that he can work in every sphere connected with his profession. And this approach of 'wide' education is commonly shared in this country which occupies one of the first places in the world scale of higher education.
Therefore we can't speak of uselessness of university theoretical education and degrees which are so hard to achieve but by all means are worth to be achieved.

RUMO5042,3.5,2.5,,,,,"Some people say that in our modern world, dominated by science and technology and industrialisation, there is no longer a place for dreaming and imagination. What is your opinion?","
It is now a very wide spread opinion, that in the modern world there is no place for dreaming and imagination. Those who share this point of view usually say that at present we are so very much under the domination of science, industry, technology, ever-increasing tempo of our lives and so on, that neither dreaming nor imagination can possibly survive. Their usual argument is very simple - they suggest to their opponents to look at some samples of the modern art and to compare them to the masterpieces of the ""Old Masters"" of painting, music, literature.
As everything which is simple, the argument sounds very convincing. Of course, it is evident, that no modern writer, painter or musician can be compare to such names as Bach, Pushkin Byron, Mozart, Rembrandt, Raffael et cetera. Modern pictures, in the majority of cases, seem to be merely repetitions or combinations of the images and methods of painting, invented very long before. The same is also true to modern verses, novels and songs.
But, I think, those, who put forward this argument, play - if I may put it like this - not fair game with their opponents, because such an approach presupposes the firm conviction, that dreaming and imagination can deal only with Arts, moreover, only with this ""well-established set"" of Arts, which includes music, painting, architecture, sculpture and literature. That is, a person, who follows the above-mentioned point of view tries to make his opponent take for granted the statement, the evidence of which is, to say the least, doubtful.
But actually, these are not only music, painting, writing which are the spheres to which one's dreaming and imagination can be applied. First of all, there are quite a few other ""arts"". Probably, these are not as well-established as those mentioned above, but they are also ""arts"", and besides, they flourish nowdays. Let us take cinema, for example. Originally, in the beginning of the century, it was only an entertainment for common people. But today we may already call it ""art"". Now it has a hundred years of its history, and we all know, that cinema is really able to create masterpieces. Our contemporaries, film-directors of this ""dominated by science, technology and industrialization"" century create at present films like ""The Good, The Bad, The Ugly"", ""8 "", ""Once Upon a Time in America"", ""Shining"" et cetera, which, perhaps, in the next century will be regarded by our descendants just like w regard Raffael's pictures or Shakespeare's sonnets now.
By the way, I can hardly observe any connection between the ""domination of science, technology and industrialization"" over our world and the decline of arts. There may be some other reasons for it, but niether science nor technology themselves. Moreover, scientific and technological progress may very often create new means and new ways to apply one's imagination and ""materialize""one's dream. For example, the newest computer technology, I think, has already created a whole range of ways to apply one's imagination - the computer design, animation and plenty of other things - and still has a great capasity for developement.
And these are, actually, not necessarily arts, to which one may apply his or her own imagination. It may be applied as well even to everyday life - at work, at home cleaning and cooking - everywhere.
We may conclude therefore, that the situation with imagination and dreaming is not as lamentable as those adherents of the opinion which is the title of the present essay try to convince us it is. At last, there is nothing new in the world, that can be done without imagination... And this is true even to those ""despots"" - science, technology and industrialization.

RUMO5043,2.5,2.0,,,,,All armies should consist entirely of professional soldiers: there is no value in a system of military service,"
The end of the Cold War and the accompanying geo-political changes in Europe have raised numerous questions about the future of European security. Minority and ethnic conflicts, border disputes which are currently the most important issues of european politics require serious thinking about the role of military power in solving security problems.
The collapse of the Soviet Union showed that a great number of soldiers in the army cannot guarantee political stability: the resources which the huge soviet military apparatus consumed helped to destroy rather than protect the Soviet system.
But understanding the necessity of reforming the armed forces does not make it clear as to how this reform should be carried out.
Some people have realized long ago that there is no use in a system of military service and that a drastic reconsideration of the principles of army-building is needed - a complete transition to the professional military forces. This transition, however, is a subject of much political and social debate, because there are still many believers in the system of military service. They main- tain that it is one of the traditional values of their countries and oppose all attempts to doubt the desire of all citizens to do their national service, thus creating the unity of the army and the people.
In fact, the situation looks much less optimistic than it seems to them. There are many inequalities in the process of con- scripting - the number of draft-dodgers who do everything to be excluded from the recruting list is constantly increasing. More and more young people use connections to avoid the service or to be provided with better conditions of doing it.
The supporters of the reform point out that the aim of the army is not to educate young people, but to provide national security.
This is a top priority.
Now a great number of people tend to support the decision to end consription and adopt a system of contract service. It is becoming obvious that the concept of ""armed nation"" is completely outdated. The modern army demands such technical and professional qualifications which amateurs simply cannot have. The time of the service is not enough for preparing trained specialists.
The drastic restructuring of the armed forces must be performed in such a way so as to reduce the cost of the services. Those opposing the reform claim that the professional forces will cost more.
But that is not a fact, nobody has counted all the direct and indirect expenditures. There is the example of Great Britain where a pro- fessional army costs less than, for example, the French army based on conscription. Even if at first the professional army costs more, in the long run the expenditures will pay.
The choice remains between fewer costly reliable professionals, or cheaper, but less reliable conscripts.
One more argument against the reform is a possible rise in unemployment. The supporters of professional army have a plan for the development of alternative compulsory social services, for example the work in firebrigades or hospitals. They may be made open for women too so as to secure a high level of employment.

It is by and large assumed that the university degrees are teoretical and have nothing to do with the real world. If we ask our graduate acquantancies about their jobs many of them would probably say that they have not obtained the work they would like to have. It occurs that a more prestigious post is occupied by a less educated person who may be not as much educated as you are but works better because he/she is more experienced. On may come across a great number of adver- tisments where there is need for a person qualified and expe- rienced in a particular area of work activity. Why is it so?
The answer is clear and simple. The theoretical course needs practice.
I would like to illustrate the point referring to my own studies. I am learning at the English Department of the philological faculty, so I am to know all important items of English, in other wards I'll know the language theoretically although I am tought to speak, write and read properly. My knowledge of English is necessary to continue my study as a postgraduate but I don't really think the knowledge of all pe- culiarities of the language can be of any use at a place which has nothing to do with theoretical study of the language.
- I would like to clarify the diffrence between theory and practice.Theoretical studies are based on practice, theory actually analyzes and systematizes data of practice. For ins- tance, we are studing the history of English. As a material we have a number of Old and Middle English texts that are acts of speech in other words practice of language. Researchers nor- mally create their own theories analyzing, generalizing and systematizing these texts. Another example of the kind con- cerns sundry dictionaries of modern English.
Based on the current use of language, they are to fix all kinds of changes appearing in the language. But there is hard- ly a theory that can cover all peculiarities of the daily lan- guage use.Theory is, generalizing an object of study, to form a certain idea of a particular object. So I think, that prac- tice is primary and theory is secondary.
At a university one studies a number of theoretical subjects, he/she gets the idea of what he/she may do when wor- king. But as prince Charles once said;' to think about doing so is one thing but to actually get up and do it is another matter altogether'. So I think that one should check one's knowledge by mere practice.

RUMO5045,2.0,2.0,,,,,"Some people say that in our modern world, dominated by science and technology and industrialisation, there is no longer a place for dreaming and imagination. What is your opinion?","
I don't agree with it. In my opinion, dreaming and ima- gination are so important in our life that they cannot di- sappear. But where can we find them? The first thought that comes to my mind is the art, I mean various kinds of it: pa- inting, music... It is a great field for using dreaming and imagination. Painters, sculptors, musicians are considered to be sentimental, delicate, inspired people who live in two worlds: the first world is real and the second one is the world of their dreaming and imagination. The art helps pain- ters, sculptors and musicians express the world of their so- uls, the world of dreams and images that we can see looking at their pictures, sculptures, or listening to some music.
But sometimes it turns out to be very difficult to un- derstand the idea of some of them because none of us can comprehend the world of imagination of another person. You can never know what is at the bottom of other people's hear- ts.
And, looking at creations made by great painters, people begin dreaming and imagining what they would have painted if they had been able to do it.
The theatre and the cinema is another kind of the art.
Every actor has his own world of imagination. That is why, I suppose, there are different kinds of perfomance: some ac- tors like to play in comedies, others prefer tragedies or ballet and opera. And not only actors but every producer has his own world of dreaming and imagination, and it depends on a producer in what way a perfomance can be introduced.
We use dreaming and imagination not only in the world of the art but also in our daily life, for example, in our clothes. Now there are lots of different styles in it. And, I think, every woman wants to be unique and to have her per- sonal style. But how to find it? Well, she is to use her imagination. And, of course, dreaming and imagination are very impotant for children. As Pamela Travers tells us in her fairy-tale ""Mary Poppins"", children have their own world of dreaming and imagination, moreover, they understand the language of the wind, birds and animals. But when children become grown-ups, they loose this ability.
But even grown-ups always have some opportunities to find themselves in the world of dreaming and imagination.
The whole world of dreams and images are opened for us by poets and writers. Poets often express beautiful dreams and create images in their poetry, and we can find a wonderful world of imagination in fairy-tales by J.R.R.Tolkien and C.S.Lewis. Many people like merry holidays, especially the New Year's Day and Christmas Day. When the holiday is co- ming, we use all our imagination to decorate our homes well.
People decorate their flats and houses, and salesmen use their imagination for decorating shops because if a shop lo- oks brightly, it will attract more customers. Salesmen are dreaming of selling some goods in time, and they use all their imagination to persuade people to buy something. Peop- le need dreaming and imagination even for science because scientists are dreaming of new machines and technologies.
And they have to use their imagination for inventing them.
So dreaming and imagination play a very important role in our life, making it more interesting and many-sided.
And, thinking of it, I cannot help remembering a small poem by Langston Hughes:  In my opinion, in our modern world, dominated by science technology and industrialisation, there is still a place for dreaming and imagination!

RUMO5046,3.0,2.5,,,,,Most university degrees are theoretical and do not prepare students for the real world. They are therefore of very little value,"
There have been so many changes in economic, social and political life in Russia in the 1980s. Nowdays there many different political parties instead of the only Communist Parny that has existed for 70 years in this country. The privatisation of the 1990s promoted the appearance of people owning shares in companies. Many people preter working for themselves and not as employees. All these changes are not enough to prevent the growth of unemployment and strikes.
So the Government's first priorities are to improve the economic situation,to curb inflation,to reduce taxes and ...
to forget about public expenditure.
I mean that the government is so slow in building up its role in educeation. At the same time in much of our public diseussions it seems taken for granted that certain essencial changes in educational system of Russia are the urgency.
Is it true or not ? It is not simple to answer this question, because there is a world of difference between the situation in education nowadays and in the past,between the situation in liberal education and technical one.
It has been assumed for many years that to enter the university, to graduate from it, to complete the university degree are the things of great value and have a lot of prestige. At present it is very easy to aim at all these things if you havt a lot of money. Furthermore, having a university degree doesn't guarantee that a person will have a good well-paid and interesting job. So many young people enter the university in order to get diploma, to show it to the parents and relatives and to begin finding a job having no connexion with his or her profession.
One more important point connected with the necessity to change the educational system of Russia is the sharp deterioration of the high standards of the education in polytechnics and technical colleges. It does'n need any proof that the Soviet engineers just after graduating from polytechnics have been able to work properly and without many difficulties in any branch of industry. But in the course of time equipment of the laboratory become obsolete and the is no money to buy new and modern one. These students having perfect knowledge of their subjects are unable,therefor, to find a job and, moreover,they can't work.In my opinion, the best way to improve this situation is for the state to realise clearly that without well-prepared specialists this country is doomed to destruction.
But the general liberal education of Russia is on the verge of completely distruction. This state has no funds for the essential purposes. There is no money for the lingvistic laboratories,no money for new books,no money for holding seientific conferences,no money for publishing books by L.Tolstoy or A.Chekhov.And the commonplace retorts to these statements are: how can you tell about money for publishing jubilee edition of the works of Bunin when many people have nothing to eat ? But that's nonsense !
One more question connected with liberal education in this contry is: does this state really need in such a number of linguists,specialists in literature, historians and writhers!
That is the question of great importance for me as for a person whose profession is the language and literature.
With the industrial and scientific revolution it has come about that to live and work well, to be at home in this new world of ours, we need to have an education which is limited neither to the know-how of our jobs nor to our duties of citizenship. Our education should let as to make money that we need for life and assist in achieving certain self- -satisfaction. Unfortunately, our university degrees don't promote these aims.
For example, now I'm a third-year student of the one the most prestigeous universities in the world. I'm a student of Moscow State University. I'm fond of reading books and discussing them with my friends. I admire my teachers, the size and deepness of their knowledge.
But at the same time I clearly realize that I'm unable to create any remarkable research, or to write an interesting book, or to work as a teacher at school. I have no skills for practical work. And I believe that not only me, but many my colleagies try to solve this dilemma - to have interesting buainess without much money or to begin to work in order to make money and to have high living conditions.

RUMO6001,2.5,2.0,,,,,"Some people say that in our modern world, dominated by science and technology and industrialisation, there is no longer a place for dreaming and imagination. What is your opinion?","
Imagination is a magic quality of a human mind, which has always promoted further development of peoples life. There is saying that laziness is the engine of the progress, I completely agree with this opinion, because just in such moments of idleness and absence of desire to do some mechanical work the ideas how to avoid it are appearing: in such moments were invented cars, electric kettles, washing machines and ice-boxes. But there is another kind of imagination - dreaming of poets, musicians and writers, and it is not absolutely connected with the progress, and not coming as a result of it.It is surprising that just in the writers minds arise the images, which can foretell the future. J. Vern long ago before the invention of a submarine wrote about the traveling below the water, he described the fly to the Moon , Raspe designed a kind of airplane, adding the balloon to the ship of his famous hero. This fact is very interesting because the technological development of that times did not assume such inventions. I think this is an evidence that human imagination is much more extensive than its result - technology, and that is why it cant be limited. Most probably the extension of imagination and technology is a correlating process. They are developing in parallel like the steps of one staircase. There is an old dream of human being to reconstruct the mechanical copy of mind, therefore there is an attempt to create an artificial mind - combination of qualities of a mans reason and the opportunities of a machine. To become the god to any creation is a very agreeable feeling( an example of such creator is doctor Frankenshtein). The whole idea of inventing an artificial mind is leading to the idea of homunculus. Like every invention this can have both sides. On the one hand a lot of industrial operations can be done without any human effort, but on the other hand such machine finally will be able to manipulate persons life.
Owing to discovering of new technologies the horizons of imagination are opening. And every new discovering brings to life a lot of new improvements and ideas. The last great discovery - computer and computer games - made it possible to get into the endless amount of realities. The imaginative world of a person can exist now out of his mind, independently, and can absorb a man. Something that before existed only in your mind is realizing in the visual world and can have great influence on us. As far as I know the most successful productions of sensational crimes caused the appearance of people who wanted to repeat something they have seen. Imagination and its realization is the sphere where the notions of what is bad or good are mixed.
.The thing which is real can not be confined within the limits. The development of technology can lead a mankind into a deadlock of suicide. It was not mentioned by the writers of the 19 century, they described encouraging sights of technology and the future do not seems to be promising. A number of stories written by R. Bradbury were devoted to this point. This writer told us about the circumstances when the development of technology is leading the neglecting of feelings, the most serious crime is to be dreamy. The Russian writers of the 20 century like Zamyatin and Platonov are anxious about human future, because it is carried by correctness and order, which are not natural to mans mind and actions. There is another point which make us to treat with technological development with prudence. A man can not practically investigate himself ,and if he is not completely aware of his mental activities ,how he can be sure about the results of his science activities.
Inside of humans soul there is the universe of subconscious fears, images and feelings. There are no bounds of dreaming that is why there are no limits of technologies. I suppose that the only possible way out is to be careful with technology and science ,and remember that everything created by human being can not be so perfect and safe.

Speaking about dreaming and imagination I must say that first of all I consider them to be the main fundamental principle of the world development. I really think that with-out them we would be living in a stone age nowadays. From the very begining people tried to explain different processes in nature. They thought that everything happens at the behest of Gods, but then they began to notice some regularities in that. Later peo-ple began to think about the improving of their lives. By improving the way of life they began to contrive new helpful things. I think that science roots can be traced back to that time.
If I will hear a statement that in our modern world there is no longer place for dream-ing and imagination, I would say that it is a faulse one. If take a look at the modern world, what will we see ?
We will see that people can't live without dreaming and imagination. We all know that there is no future without past. Scientists always tried to imagine the way our an-cestors have been living long time ago and what kind of culture values they had. I think this gives a reason for the existence of such science as arceology. Name Schlieman was written down in golden letters, because he has made valuable contributions for the science, excaviting remains and ruins of ancient civilization. He passed through hardships and sufferings in order to make their dreams become true. Even nowadays scientists are still searching for some information about ancient Atlantice. Nobody knows whether it is a legend or a truth. The answer to this question is somewhere between dreaming and imagination.
Nowadays people dream about leaving some traces after themselves in history.
We all know about famous Hinness records book, where we can find everything about personal extraordinary achievements. Therefore, whithin the bounds of possibility, men of science are trying to invent "" perpetum mobile "", but nobody succeeded in it, though it could be one of the greatest discoveries of humanity and could bring fame for many generations ahead to it's founder.
Recently I have read an interesting article about one man, who despiting the fact that airplanes have been already created, decided to copy the flight of Icar and Dedal. Trying to escape from Cyprus Dedal made wings of feather and wax for himself and his son Icar. So did the man. He was eager to show that legends can become true, but he failed... As well as heroes did. In history and literature these human beings remained as symbols of human dissatisfaction.
In the process of development people have always been looking for converting their plans into reality. And they still continue to do so. And, perhaps, always will. Impro-ving already existing things we get new ones: electric tea-pots, mobile phones, com-puters, microwaves and many other things, although it may seem that there is nothing to create anymore.
The low-governed nature of social development shows, that the moment society stops dreaming and improving means of its living it stops to exist. I do believe that without fantasy and imagination society's history will turn into blank pages. And I think that most people would agree with this point of view, because it is imagination, that brings joy and colour to our lives and makes them very interesting. The importance of imagination and dreaming simply can't be denied.

RUMO6003,3.5,2.5,,,,,"Some people say that in our modern world, dominated by science and technology and industrialisation, there is no longer a place for dreaming and imagination. What is your opinion?","
From the very outset I would like to say that I cannot agree with this statement. If it is true then there are no men in the world, then it consists of different kinds of robots and machines, and not of the human beings; for humans, as I see them, are first of all supposed to have feelings, ability to think and to dream. If not, then our life would not make sense, then we would not have what we have, because only thanks to these human features our lives are what they are with all their good and bad sides.
First of all, I think, science and industrialisation should be grateful to dreaming and imagination because these last ones gave men a shove to new discoveries and inventions. For example, different fantastic stories and novels are certainly the fruits of somebody s imagination and therefore they reflect mens dreams and hopes. In the XIXth century, for instance, people were dreaming of different kinds of transportation, ground as well as air. And in the course of our century all their dreams came true. The dreams of our days are usually concerned with space,other planets and even alien civilizations. We will see what happens during the next age or so. Thus men s innocent fantasies give rise to long and difficult investigations and as a result to the great discoveries and glorious triumphes in the world of science and technology.
Another example concerns scientific researches. Most of the population of the Earth of all times was and is dreaming to live longer ( if not to be immortal ) and to remain young and attractive. Well who can deny that so many steps are already made and are to be made in this field of study. I suppose there is no and there would be no such a medecin to maintain our lives forever. But many of the diseases are curable, and plastical surgery is on a very high level nowadays.
Another important point to be made here is that dreaming, and imagination, and hopes that support them may sometimes have a great influence on our lives.
It means to say that hoping gives us a good push to live, to act, to create and so on and so forth. We may have all sorts of hopes and about anything at all, but the fact is that they form a fundament to our dreams, however small and innocent or daring and magnificent they are. And if we loose all this imaginitive side of our life then it becomes useless, and the end begins at a moral weakness which leads to physical and finally to death.
There is a sad story, that I have heard from my grandmother; and certainly it is a love-story, which tells us about a young loving couple separated by the evil men, not forever but for a certain period of time. These young man and young girl lived in hope to see each other as soon as possible, and everything they were dreaming of was their love and their desire to hurry up the course of time. But the young girl was very penetrating and she had an incling that their happiness is doomed; and she was right. While she had been waiting her beloved was killed by their enemy. So she began fading and eventually died. And, as you understand, her dreams and hopes had left her, what actually caused her death.
Our feelings, our fantasy - they can not be thrown away out of our reality.
However hard we try and work, however long we stay at work with different sorts of technical inventions (that surround us, as a matter of fact, anywhere we go and whatever we do ), anyway there is always time and may be a certain place where each of us likes to stay alone, and to have a rest, and to to think over his or her future, that is to dream, or to remember some pleasant moments of the past, which is also dreaming. And even when we sleep, which forms 1/3 of our life, we also have dreams in which sometimes our boldest and most impracticable fantasies come true. Sometimes they can capture us to such extend that we cannot work, or we do everything wrong just because we are up in the clouds.
As a conclusion I would like to reiterate. Imagination is a characteristic feature of the human beings; we cannot do without it and it helps us a lot. And also it helps to what it is opposed to - to science technology and industrialisation, may be indirectly but still. We may, with all confidence, call it the basis of our life organisation.

RUMO6006,3.0,2.0,,,,,"In the words of the old song: ""Money is the root of all evil""","
The more you have the more you want. This almost a proverb is actual not only nowadays. Since mankind appeared in the world, there also appeared the division into the weak and those, who had power. The presence of this power caused different calamities and poor living of the weak. Since money made it's ""presentation"" to the world public, the big race for catching it began. Poor started to strive for money, because they wanted to reach another level of life. Such kind of making a fortune led to sufferings of the others, because the process of becoming rich was always accomplished at the expence of the others.
The amount of examples of the evil of money in literature is numerous. May be it is one of the most preferable themes in novelistic art. The first that immideately comes to my mind is world known Dostoevskiy's "" Crime and punishment "".Raskolnikov killed the old woman because he decided that according to his theory such deed can be done. But the first reason was his debt. Poor thing, he was so busy with different complex reasoning that he just forgot about money, that he had to return. So the root of the murder is still money.
Another picturesque view waits for us in long-long "" History of Tom Jones, a Foundling "" of Henry Fielding. Blifil is the sly hypocrite, who constantly tells on Tom and poisons his uncle's mind against him. His intense desire for uncle's money leads to Tom's calamities. So Tom falls out of Squire Allworthy's favour and is sent away from home... By the way, the problem of illegal inheritance is still actual in our modern life.
So far so good, but...The list can be continued with some examples from fairy tales or historical novels, but still it is not enough to illustrate the idea.
One of my closest friends was engaged to a perfect young man. They really loved each other and decided to get married, but the main thing was that he couldn't provide her with the way of life that she thought she had deserved. Who possibly could imagine that such firm relationship can be dissolved in two weeks. The girl suddenly met her old friend, whom she hasn't seen since school graduating.That man was a kind of businessman, who had made some shady dealings for self-prosperity.
So he was very "" advanced "" person with many influential connexions, euro- appartment on Tverskaya street and, perhaps, villa somewhere in Spain... The proposal was made, two more days were left for reflections and finally everything was O.K. ! Poor outcast was to drag out a miserable existence and a lovely pair spent wonderfull honey-moon in France.
The story is rather typical for our mercantile century, though melodramatic, and perfectly suits for a second-class-edition-romance. People love all those barely perceptible details of the stories,that include power, money and all Bohemic things that take their breath away and excite imagination. Perhaps it is so because no matter how rich or poor you are, you simply can't be indifferent to the word "" money "" whether it is a nicle or Rockefeller's inheritance. That 's because of it's invariable concomitants, by which we know power (again), survival, happiness, envy, begging, destitution VS prosperity and hundreds and hundreds more! Money ( or it's substitute ) has created them and made them follow it's every step, or motion or whatever it can be called!
But... All these big words are nothing to the axiom: no matter how hard or dirty money is, we CAN'T live or, to say better, exist without it. It reminds me of David Lawrence's qoutation: "" Money is our madness, our vast collective madness ! ""

Some people say that in our modern world dominated by science technology and industrialization there is no longer a place for dreaming and imagination. Having read this my first impulse was to say 'OF COURSE THIS IS NOT TRUE. That is the power of imagination which makes people different from the rest of living beings and from machines. But after some thinking I had to recognize that to an extend this statement is true; may be it is just too categorical.
I should say that modern science and technology rather tend to suppress imagination, than leave no place for it at all. There may be few aspects of this influence of science on our minds. First I suppose can be characterized as theoretical abstract one. What I mean is that this problem in fact takes its roots in the argument what is primary, reason or feeling? And in our modern world there is a tendency to acknowledge reason to be more important than our emotions. We used to think analytically, to base our judgments on concrete facts proved by science. Reliability and exactness are our highest authorities. The second aspect of this influence is practical and concerns our every day life. For example looking at children's drawings, watching their games and reading their compositions we admire their vivid imagination. But now more and more children spend their time playing computer games, which in fact require only some physical skills. And no effort of imagination. The same refers to television. I would not speak here of stupid programs and soap operas shown on TV. Let it be a film based on some masterpiece of literature. Still it gives us ready images and does not stir our imagination. But I don't mean that science is incompatible with imagination. In fact any scientific achievement is first of all base on human dream to make our life somehow better. And although science has explained to us many phenomena of life, still there are plenty of undiscovered mysteries stirring imagination both of scientists and common people. Even more obvious is the link between art and imagination. In this case imagination is not just mental ability but the most valuable gift. And it is impossible to be an artist if you don't posses it. But here again can rise the question of science technology. Nobody would object that for example computer graphics and music became extremely popular nowadays. On the one hand , somebody can say that this is not the real art, that a man does not create himself. On the other hand, sometimes this computer graphics catch our attention , impress with its originality. Not all people can draw and computer can help them to reveal their images.
Above I tried to explain the connection between our ability to dream and imagine and scientific technology. But I think that to a greater degree this ability depends on a concrete personality, individual way of thinking. Some people prefer always to be realistic, logical, sensible in all circumstances. They may have some practical dreams and step by step they reach them. They live in agreement with reality and are not afraid of it. Others on the contrary are not satisfied with our reality. They are always looking for some ideal, dreaming about it imaginating it. They live in dreamland and consider it to be real and beautiful:  ( Dreams by Edgar Allan Poe) ",0.6666666666666667

Life of the young in an over-industrialized world is fool of unexpected turns.
New ideas come our way practically at every step, and very often dominate our young nimble minds and seem to have a life of their own. Thus, integrating into the world of new technologies and new ideas has ceased to be a challenge for the happy few. It is now a full-time job, for those who are on the alert to find their road in life. It would not do you any good to live the life of a maverick with books and theories crouching over you. On the other hand plunging into this world of modern life might be no less harmful both for your identity and your health. The world of reality and the world of make- believe are to coexist peacefully if not in perfect harmony. If you ask me, I think life is to be enjoyed. After all, what is the idea of spending your green years in the subdued excellence of libraries and reading halls unless you can at last hope to enjoy. Enjoying a thought relishing it, testing it for depth and exploring its modern application is what university student is to make his primary goal in life. Is it not the world of make-believe? Or is this life of human thought put against day-to-day formalities of existence ? I wonder.
Some people think that life is like a good book. The further you get into it the more it begins to make sense. I think it is a very rich idea and most stimulating as a motivation. Us, being the writers of our lives, the chance of starting a new chapter does not present itself more often than one would wish.
Checking on the mistakes in something we have written takes most of our life leaving a spacious room for improvement on the one hand and a slight chance for saying something outrageously original on the other.
What do we come into our professional life for ? To take in the knowledge of the past, to touch upon the masterful perfection of the present and, perhaps, to aspire for the enchanted afar. Is not it dreaming ? I am convinced it is so even if you have to stare at the world with wide-open eyes of exited disbelieve.  What is this life, if full of care we have no time to stand and stare... -- this allusion to the famous poem seems to be very much to the point in language study, since language in its primary oral form is nothing more than a diachronic bridge between generations of people and universe. The firmer your bridge is, the better chance you stand of not falling behind the overwhelming process of evolution of human thought .
The pace of life quickens daily. Thus, being too realistic about keeping track of the latest achievement of humanity in whatever sphere you take up is not very promising. The world of make-believe is of unsurpassed value. It takes the load off your mind, makes you wonder, protects you against the destroying effects of selfcriticism and inspires you with a romantic zest for selfperfection. The world of make-believe is ideal, it is devoid of imperfect things. Sometimes it is like peering at a crystal ball in the hope of making Santa Claus fulfil your wish.
The good thing about dreaming is that occasionally dreams do come true, and a dreamer like no other person is eager to share the goal with all those busking in his friendship and devotion. A dreamer is definitely a better person than a dry moralist --- inquisitive, easily exerted and genuinely grateful.

Money is the root of all evil! On the one hand, one cannot disagree with these words. On the other hand, many think that the root of all evil is in people themselves. I often ask myself which of these two utterances is true and more and more I am inclined to think that both of them are closely connected with each other, because money and people are always together.
There are people who say that they do not care about money and they can easily live without them. It seems to me that they are insincere. Every person wants to be rich, may be not extremely rich, but at least quite well-off. I do not understand why people deny it. You know, there is no harm in this wish itself.
As for me I would like to be rich, because money, in my opinion, gives a man the most important thing in the world - freedom, and, of course, one should not forget about confidence, because it is very important for a person to feel self- confident.
When I meditate on money as the root of all evil I cannot but think about politics and politicians as well. Most politicians pretend to be honest people when they are not. They say that everything they do they do out of interests of ordinary people, or out of interests of the country. They promise to improve people's life when they run, for instance, for deputies, but they forget all the promises as soon as they get a high position. All the politicians care about is interests of their own. In spite of the fact that they have no right to set up business, most of them are owners of various shops and companies, because they have certain privileges and all the doors are open for them. What outrages me about politicians most of all is the fact they break wars only to make money. They try to convince us that it was inevitable and they did their best to settle the conflict in a peaceful way. But of course the real reason for breaking the war is money again. Politicians are not concerned about young boy's life. Their greed for money is too strong that the money is got at the expense of many people's life. I think, and I am sure many people will agree with me, that breaking a war out of personal interests is a crime and people who are responsible for it must be severely punished.
There are people who want to become rich at all costs. They are ready to steal, to rob and even to kill in order to get 'easy' money. People like that believe that it is much easier for them to work with their hands. They do not think that they have no right to take a person's life, which was given to them by God. Killers just do their 'dirty' job and get away with the money.
When speaking about money and rich people I would like to say that not all of them are unscrupulous people. Many rich people use their money for good purposes: They contribute money to building of hospitals, houses where old people or young people who have no parents will live in. Prosperous people usually take part in the organization of various festivals and exhibitions. In this case we cannot say that money is the root of all evil.
As far as I am concerned I cannot help admiring such people. They can be a pattern to us all.
But of course, we cannot deny the fact that money spoils people. Even an ideal person can yield to temptation to get much money when he is suggested that he should commit something downright atrocious. In this case we may say that the money has a harmful influence over human beings, indeed.
To conclude I would like to say that not only money is the root of all evil, because money do not exist apart from a person.
Money has always been a reason for envy and until it exists people will long for it because, whatever they say, money gives you power over the world , and it all depends on a person whether they use money on good purposes or on evil deeds.

First of all, I'd like to say that it is only men's opinion. It is strange, but there is no an exact opinion according the meaning of this notion. Men are sure that ""feminism"" is an evil for women and sometimes men suppose that a feminist and ""a man in a skirt"" are synonyms.
I think men can not submit that women moved them from their imperious pedestal. And men mask their displeasure by pointing women their place in life.
Their arguments are so childish nowadays! For instance, they confirm that women should spend more time at home bringing up children and washing up. My opinion is that a man is a conquer by nature and if he likes a woman who like a domestic animal and dreams only about how to get marry and all this house routine than such a man is not worthy of another woman.
Also men do not want to admit that women can be leaders. But women manage with a role of chief and even successfully. ""A woman-leader""- this theme was raised not only in the emancipated 20th century. Even in the 18th century Samuel Johnson gravely reasoned that such a woman ""like a dog which walks on its hind legs. Dogs will never do it well but everybody are surprised that they generally do it"". Fortunately, the situation has changed and two hundred years have passed and now we can see that women are able not only to control enterprises but they even can rule countries.
Almost all men are sure that woman becomes a feminist when her boyfriend abandons her. It is a delirium and only men with their self-deception can imagine it. Perhaps, earlier women became depressed after breaking off the relations but now they see that there are a lot of opportunities to realize their plans without men.
Of course, there are a lot of extremes. Let's take, for example, Western feminists.
They think that it is humiliatingly for a woman to make up and have a hair-do in order to men like them. That is why they wear the unisex style clothes. There are also special communities where it is forbidden for men to come there: ladies rest from men.
Notions ""feminist"" and ""business-lady"" (or ""self-made woman"") are not equal in Western society unlike our country. Business-lady can take her bearings for family (by the way, it is in fashion in Europe lately) and she turns into a loving wife and a careful mother at home. That is a type of a woman that I accept. The situation in Russia is different. May be it is because of our difficult conditions of life but women should choose between career and family. It is difficult for them to combine these two things. Besides, flower of masculine population of Russia was destroyed twice: after the 17th year and during the Great Patriotic War (to say nothing of Stalin's repressions). That is why most of Russian men are not corresponded to Russian women. It is difficult to find a suitable partner because in our country a man who does not tipple is already a desirable trophy for many women.
Of course, such an individual can make a woman to stay by him till she has an inferiority complex and does not realize herself as a personality. As soon as she begins to believe in her power and herself she has a choice: to break off their relationship or to live with him. And majority chooses the first variant because they see that their husbands are not able to earn their living.
That is why a well-dressed, effective, good-looking and self-assured woman is often called ""a feminist"" in our country. Of course, she has to be a feminist because there are few men who suit her and she has to occupy the position of self-sufficiency.
And may be because of her assured appearance men do not like her. So, I do not think that feminists have done more harms to the cause of women than good.

RUMO7035,3.0,2.5,,,,,The prison system is outdated. No civilized society should punish its criminals: it should rehabilitate them,"
Discussing the question that criminals should not be punished and the society should rehabilitate them seems to me ubnormal. In this country we can talk not about rehabilitation but about encouraging criminals. It is considered prestigeous to be a criminal, they have money and what is sad the public respect. Nowadays in ordinary people's consciousness a criminal is a person who wakes up about 3 p. m., has dinner in best restaurants, who is always hanging around in nihgt clubs and discotheques, they are owners of luxurious cars and masters of charming models and obligatory participants of fights between various gangs late nights. Belonging to the world of criminals is associated with prosperity. And it is set aside that this sham happiness is based on sorrows and misfortune of other people. As they say it is the other side of the coin, but at present people are used to thinking that everything its own price and they accept this condition of material well-being as something which goes without saying. We have criminalization not only of some levels, but of the whole society, but of course it does not mean that every individual person takes part in some crime, but they become voluntary or unvoluntary accomplices, silent observers, because there are few people who have courage to resist this way of life.
It seems to me that spiritual values which for centuries had been a pivot for people, have gone never to return. Pressing on criminal world's arrangement takes place by means of its propaganda in films, computer games and of course in real life.
Juvenile delinquence is increasing with a striking speed. But children follow adults' example. How can we explane to a child that they should go to school, enter some institute if they their parents honerstly earning money can hardly make both ends meet.
Another point I want to touch upon is what society can be called civilized. I do not think that society members of which live up to the principle that time is money can be called civilized. Here we should rather talk about the individual Western civilisation in which money is a key-word. And the result of the legal proceedings often depends on amount of money the accused has. For example in the USA the trial may last for years pumping cash over from people being at law to attorneys' pockets. People do not stint paying for lawer's services as the outcome of the affair depends on the competence and oratory of the Phemida's servants. Not without reason this profession is one of the most prestigeous and highly paid. So the trial is a certain competition in skill and ability to make impression on a magistrate. And instead of arriving at the truth to find a committer of a crime a thrilling play takes place. And the main prize in this game is finding a winner not guilty although it can be untrue.
So can the society in which finding the truth is defined by resorting to various devices and tricks be considered civilized.
Nowadays the most wide spread punishement for serious crimes is imprisonment, in other words isolation of the criminal from society. And the isolation should assist them in reeducation and turning a person, who once had broken the law, into a member of society of full value. But I do not think that the probability of such reeducation is great, as if a person commited a crime when they had not only bad but also good examples of behaviour and they have chosen the bad one, and in prison they find themselves in surrounding of people similar to them without a model of decent behaviour.
As a rule most of those who served their sentence venture to commit another crime. Prison is considered to be a certain school of criminals, where they grind their ""profession"". So criminals return to prison because leaving it they are just not prepared psychologi- cally.
But I am sure there is no alternative to prison yet. In various countries prisons are overcrouded, and crime is increasing with the exeption of some countries of the Middle East where for example the punishment for pickpocketing or burglary consists of chopping the thief's hand off. May be it's too cruel but extremely effective.
I think that every criminal should realise his guilt. The isolation of the criminal without his realisation of his guilt will not do for the purpose of punishing him. Only our conscience may punish us. The only proper punishment for the criminal is the pricks of conscience wherever he is at the moment, it does not matter if he is imprisoned or not.

RUMO7036,3.0,,,,,,The prison system is outdated. No civilized society should punish its criminals: it should rehabilitate them,"
The problem of crime and law enforcement remains for the modern civilised society a most difficult one to solve nowadays. Much of course has been done already:for instance,death-penalty is abolished in some countries,for it is proved that it has no effect on committion of crimes.But the prison system is still outdated and it hardly can be the way out from the situation of increasing criminality.
Inprisonment is generally considered to be a worst tragedy,that only can happen,it scares people as much as death,for indeed after a number of years in prison a guilty person will never be the same.The institution,that is aimed to rehabilitate criminals,let them make up for what they have committed and really repent of it only succeeds in corrupting them.As a result these people are lost for the society.
The appolling information of prisons that we get from numerous films makes us more conserned that if a sentence to spending several years in a penetentiary is not the end of the life, it is certainly a great danger to the condemned person,for to survive one almost always has to either adapt to the ill atmosphere of the place and be enga- ged in a kind of savage and barbaric activity, or escape from the prison,which is hardly the thing one can do in reality.Of course what we see in films must not be taken too seriously,such information is exaggerated to impress the masses,and this aim is achieved.But the strange thing is that though people are afraid of prison,the number of crimes committed is still encreasing.
The roots of the problem can be found in the modern society.And the point is that it fights against criminals ,not the crime it- self.That is why the thought of conviction frightens people more than the idea of buglary,for instance (if they are not the victims of it,of course).On the one hand the modern society claims itself to be more civilised,that is to say, more humane.People can sympathize with suf- fering of the others and understand a criminal's motives,even soften the sentence if the person pleads guilty.But on the other hand people have become more aggressive;images of violence,of unpleasantness,of evil,of cruelty on TV, violent language,violent activity,considered nowadays a heroic,manly thing to do,all that is characteristic of our life.As the result we have what we have ; some people commit crimes and the others,led by fear and vengeance condemn them to stern punish- ment - lock them up in jail,where the convicts think much more of de- fending their lives,than of their guilt and the atonement for it.In
fact they are far from feeling remorseful, and,as cruelty causes not- hing else but cruelty,they become really dangerous.It's still more depressing,for many teens are among these people.Crime,first committed out of ignorance,can be repeated a number of times then.It is known,that ex-prisoners are more likely to commit crime,than other pe- ople.So,we have to admit,that the existing prison system can't be the way out of this vicious circle.It is far from being perfect,and the society,that calls itself civilised should be ashamed of it.What must be done is first of all to prevent crimes,and then,if one has been committed,to punish the guilty person so that he would be given a chan- ce to rehabilitate himself.This is really important,for the whole sys- tem of law inforcement leaves much to be desired.Supposing,a mistake has been made and an innocent person is brought to the court and char- ged for the crime someone else has committed.In fact,this is what pe- ople think will never happen to them.Still,one can't be so sure of it.The evidence has been heard,the verdict has been reached and the accused is convicted of the offence.What is to become of this unfortu- nate,while the case is decided at the Appeal Court? Alas,this is quite obvious: an innocent person is sent to prison, where he/she will be treated as if he/she were dirt.And when the convict is released another problem crops up.Will the society take such a person back and treat him/her as before ? Probably not.There is prejudice about ex-criminals and it is not at all groundless.People always remember what a former convict has experienced and keep in their mind that this person can commit another crime.Well,it might be so.But maybe if the society gave its criminals a real opportunity of rehabilitation,less crimes would be committed.And we should also remember,that the most of criminals do not stay in prison forever.They will not always be sepa- rated from us and the civilised society must not be indifferent.Somet- hing ought to be done to improve the prison system and the way to re- habilitate criminals should be found.

RUMO7061,2.5,2.5,,,,,"In the words of the old song: ""Money is the root of all evil""","
Money is widely used to purchase goods,services and to pay debts.The use of money began before the great civilizations of Egypt and Mesopotamia developed.The barter unit of value,a commodity used as a standard of value, was the first money.It
was the principal form of wealth in a society.
Early civilizations recognized the need for convenient forms of money. The Egyptians used gold,silver and other metals as long ago as 2500 b.c. In the 17th century b.c. the rulers of Lydia,in Asia Minor,issued coins.Paper money was first issued by the Chinese during the 9th century a.d.
Thus,the purpose of money is to aid in the fast and efficient exchange of goods and services.But nowadays people set a high value on money.They seek material values instead of human and it,as a rule,leads to a great tragedy. Some people are so crasy about money that they aspire to get it by fair means or foul.They are ready to commit a crime and they do it.I'd like to adduce evidence in support of my words.
Two years ago the police defused a bomb planted at a St.Petersburg train station.The bomb was accompanied by a note warning that future bombs would target trains carring foreigners unless the municipal authorities pay two hundred and twenty-five thousand dollars to a person calling himself ""the Mole"".The police found the bomb on the roof of a kiosk.A
policeman said that the bomb wouldn't have done any damage to the trains if it had blown up but it would have injured dozens of people.I don't know if the police arrested that man but I hope they did.
Very often criminals kidnap people in order to hold them to ransom.In 1932 an unknown malefactor kidnapped Charles August Lindburg.His father (Charles Lindburg) was a famous pilot.The nurse of the three-year old boy found a note warning that if the parents didn't pay fifty thousand dollars for their child,the boy would be killed.Charles Lindburg did his best to find his son but it was in vain.
One month later a man discovered a corpse of a little boy in the forest. Mr. Lindburg recognized his son in the morgue.
Medical experts told him that Charles August had been killed by a heavy blow on the back of the head.Soon the man who had committed this crime was arrested.His name was Bruno Hauptman.His lawyers did their best to prove that Bruno wasn't guilty ( despite evidence to the contrary ).But Hauptman was found guilty and soon he was executed.
Cruelty of such people horrifies me.Can they be so brutal that they don't muse on the destinies of their victims? Can it be true that their thirst for money is so strong that it makes such people obtain it (money) for love or money? I can't understand these people with their hearts of stone and I don't want to.I just despise them.
The most terrific thing is that even children began committing different crimes for money.Many teen-agers extort money from their contemporaries.In the case of refusal they beat up their victims or kill them.
In Ulan-Ude eight teen-agers were accused of an attempt of kidnapping. They had committed many crimes before they were arrested.
Mothers sell their children...Children kill their parents...People destroy each other...To tell the truth,it is very dangerous to live in the world where money talks.
I can't help saying that cash shortage makes people risk their health. Two years ago a group of Metro tunnel diggers was back in daylight after spending four weeks underground on hunger strike in protest at unpaid wages?_?2.?.?0The last four drill workers out of this original group of twelve decided to end a vigil in the new Krasnodonskaya subway extension in southwest Moscow after they received ten million to twelve million rubles each from their employer,the Tonot construction company,in payment of eight months of wage arrears.Five workers were admitted to the hospital in the course of the strike.Fortunately,they recovered a month later.
Sometimes a lack of money forces people to do terrible things.I know that a woman sold her kidney to provide for her children.Girls sell their bodies to support their parents.I
have no right to blame these people but I think that there is another way out of such a terrible situation.
It's necessary to add that rich people also become victims of crimes.In March 1995 the head of some restaurants was murdered in what the police described as a contract killing.I think that the reasons of this murder were power and...money.
Thus,money is the root of all evil.I don't want to deny the importance of money but it is a silly thing to highlight it.To tell the truth,I'm afraid of living in the world where money rules.I want to cry: ""People,stop! Think what you are doing! How dare you value money above a human life!"" But they won't hear me.Someday people will come to reason but I'm afraid,it will be too late.

RUMO7062,3.0,2.0,,,,,The prison system is outdated. No civilized society should punish its criminals: it should rehabilitate them,"
The problem of crime has always existed in our society. A criminal is a person who broke the law. Accordingly, he must be punished. Keeping a criminal in prison is the prevalent way of punishment. There is an opinion that the prison system is outdated and in any civilized society instead of being punished criminals should be rehabilitated.
From my point of view it is a rather serious problem. One cannot definitely say if prisons must exist or not. This system of punishment has been in existense for a long time and one cannot just abolish it in one day. People are used to this system. No one wants to be sent to prison and it prevents some people from commiting a crime.
Although, unfortunately, there are many criminals who may be afraid of prison but still run the risk and break the law.
So should a civilized society punish its criminals or rehabilitate them? In my opinion, it depends on several factors. Firstly, one should take into consideration the motives of a crime. Secondly, one cannot ignore its type. And thirdly, one must not forget about the individuality of the person who commited the crime.
Let me give an example. A man steals money. He may have done it because he is a beggar and he is dying of starvation.
He may be a kleptomaniac. And finally, he may be a robber who steals on purpose.
We can see that in the first two cases the man needs a definite kind of help. And in the third case he must be punished because he does not have to rob and he realizes it but he does it.
So the robber deserves punishment and he has got it. He is in prison. But what awaits him later? When he gets out of prison all doors are shut before him. He cannot have a flat, he cannot find a job, he has lost his friends and so on. He is a criminal for people. He is not a person for them any more. We do realize that every persons can take another chance but we cannot let him do it. We cannot help being suspicious of him because he has been to prison. There was an article in a newspaper. A woman writes that her friends' son has been in prison for six years. His parents died and their flat is occupied by another man now. The woman paid for the man's driving lessons but he cannot receive a driving license because he does not have a residence permit (the man who was in prison). He is in despair and he says: ""I would rather rob. When I am in prison again I shall not need a residence permit"". So no one really wants to help him.
>From my point of view it is unnecessary to abolish the prison system but it is necessary to improve the conditions under which prisoners live. We must not forget that criminals are people, first of all. And any person has the right to take one more chance and to change his life. To rehabilitate a criminal it is not enough to give him a chance. It is necessary to believe that he can change himself and become better, Unfortonately, there are more serious crimes than robberies. I mean murders. If a man kills another man in cold blood. I do not think it is enough to rehabilitate him (if it is possible). Of course a murderer must be punished. Just imagine the feelings of the victim's relatives. I do not think they would like the killer to be simply rehabilitated.
May be the prison system is out dated. But I do not see any way out of the situation. Because, to my mind, our society is not ready for changes of the kind. The problem is not only in the material expenses but in people's ideology and their attitude to criminals.
As for me, I think that a man who kills people must be punished and isolated because he is dangerous for society. In a newspaper there was an interview with a hangman. He says that one man has no right to kill another man. But he saves people from the scum of the earth.
So I believe that first of all it is important to improve our laws and investigate crimes more carefully in order to punish those who really deserve it. I do not think that it is possible to rehabilitate a grown-up criminal. In any case it is very difficult. A man can only do it himself. And the most severe punishment is one's concsience. We must bring out concsience in people when they are children so as not to rehabilitate them when they are grown-ups.

RUMO8004,2.5,3.0,,,,,Feminists have done more harm to the cause of women than good,"
I beleive this statement is completely untrue. Feminists have done a lot to the cause of women.Indeed there have always been organisations of women compaigning to promote women's interests in society.
Feminists concentrated on gaining access for women to education, employment and political interests. Feminism is concerned with ending legal discrimination against women and removing all barriers which prevent their entry into the public spheres on equal terms with men.During last four decades of the nineteenth century a series of campaigns emerged to improve women's legal and economic position.
Feminists have pressed for public policies to outlaw discrimination against women - both direct discrimination such as paying a woman less than a man doing the same job and indirect discrimination such as attaching unnecessary conditions to a job which will have the effect of excluding a woman. Feminists try to gain access for women to the rights ,activities and responsibilities commonly available to men and to be ""let in"" to full participation in all areas of society as it currently exists.
Prevailing cultural norm used to require women to subordinate their active and creative needs to conform to a housewife role . As a result , stay-at home women felt empty and dissatisfied , tired and depressed .
There used to be sexual division of labour in the home , which designated the male as a breadwinner and his wife as economically dependent on him and responsible only for child care and housework.
This role left them fill rather isolated and low status. Moreover , women's dependent economic status gave men full control over the allocation of money within the home , and this often resulted in women not receiving the necessary benefits of men's wages. Such situation could spoil the relations within the family completely.
But now , because of women's movement,the situation has changed.
The employment of women, their ability to get a higher paid jobs affects the power structure of the family. A woman is no longer dominated by man , dependent on him , since their recources are equalized. Thus , a working wife's husband listens to her more , and she listens to herself more. She expresses herself and has more opinions. Instead of looking up into her husband's eyes and worshipping him ( what can make him a complete tyran ) , she levels with him , what makes him respect her. That doesn't certainly mean that a woman necessarily must devote her whole life to career - on the contrary , many feminists glorified her role as a mother. She just must have an opportunity to do both - her career and her housework. And I think , women's position in the public spheres of work and politics can not be viewed in isolation from their role in private sphere of home and family.
Still I beleive feminists must continue their struggle. There are still areas of professional work where women are grossly underrepresented.
Economic growth have improved women's material position , but many still experience poverty and their standard of living tends to be lower on average than men's - so , the goal of financial independence for women is not completely won. The questions arise naturally : Why women play such comparatively a small role in politics ? Why are low paid workers predominently women and high-paid professionals and managers mainly men ? So, as we can see , men as a group still gain a privileged position in society.
I also beleive that the political emergence of women acting consciously against domination by men is not just activiation of a new interest group. It's a historical event which holds the promise of enabling a more complete challenge of domination than has ever been possible before. Feminists' campaign have a long-term goal of transforming all relationships of domination and subordination in society.

I should say that this statement sounds too categorical and besides there is something fishy about it , something that I'm going to point out to you in this paper. Before I begin critisizing , I'd like to say that everyone has right to have his own point of view , whatever the subject might be.
It is noooow generally recognizeed that all aspects of the modern life are influnced to a certain degree by computers.
All over the world people are getting more and more sophisticated as far as the dealing with electronic gadgets is concerned .
It stands to reason that if something new comes into our life then the old things should become obsolete .
At an age of computers , videosets and tape recorders the amount of different 'worlds' is simply swamping.
'Computerboys' will have no subject to discuss if left with the bodybuilders or sailors .Theatergoers won't waste their time with those who cannot imagine their life without rave and exstazy.Examples of the kind may be multiplied indefinitely.
To work with computer is a very time consuming work and especially for the beginners who find it thrilling but difficult to work with the electronic devices.
No doubt it is imposible to imagine our life without even the smallest dadoos which everyone has at home , let alone the TVsets . No doubt they are important to us but it is also obvious that the progress and the amazing or , as it is sometimes said ,appalling results do not produce those qualities that are characteristic only to humanbeings , and namely : love , harmony with nature , kindness and soon and so forth .
But let us now turn to the semantic of words and see what useful info we can derive from it .
First and foremost we should go and see what the words really mean , to make it quite clear that we are fully aware of the meaning of the words -- dreaming, and imagination.
So, dream--1) a series of thoughts ,images that you expirience when you are asleep.
2) something you hope for and want to happen very much.
3) a set of pleasant thoughts that make you forget about what is really happenning Imagination -- the ability to form an idea or ideas in your mind.
Let us try and point out those meanings which belong to the past and which are no longer in use.
If you are not a night-worker or a lunatic etc then you are expected to sleep at night . It is a common knowledge that there are days when you can remember your dreams and there are ' bad days' when your ability to reccolect anything is reduced to the utmost minimum , to zero in the other words.
If your digestion is bad then you will belong to those sleepers who may be called 'nightmarewatchers' . If you are a lucky dog and you are not acquiented with tommy upsets , colics etc then you will have good dreams .
The second meaning is eternal , simply because you won't find a person without desires . No one can abolish desires neither science, nor progress.
The third one -- a set of pleasant thoughts.
Daydreaming has never been as popular as it is now : the number of those who are addicted to all kinds of drugs is slowly but steadily increasing ; more and more people are beginning to explore Internet : to spent the time of their lives in virtual realities and , finally , everyone watches TV programms which most of the time have nothing to do with reality.
In the light of all above we can conclude that the statement used as the the title of the paper is false and unsubstantiated .

RUMO8008,3.0,2.0,,,,,"In the words of the old song: ""Money is the root of all evil""","
All our life is connected with money. We deal with money when we go shopping, buy clothes, go to the theatre or to the cinema, when we travel and buy something useless, in other words we spend them. The ways we get money are also different.
Somebody works in the mine, earning his red cents, but somebody ears his millions by deception and betray. Whatever we go or do we have to pay for everything. We can't deny the importance of money in our lifes.
Many people believe that everything on the earth can be sold and bought, forgetting that such things as love and friendship are priceless, they gains with sincerity and devotion. But the assurance in the great power of money is just a fiction, because what they buy for money is a pitchful substitute of the real feeling full of deception and lie.
Money has a negative in fluence upon people, spoils human nature, exhausts human soul. Trying to have better life some people are ready to forget their principles and event go to crime or murder.
Much money makes big politics, that's why money and power are indissoluble things, they always go together and also combine with boundless ambitions and unquenchable wish of self-statement. This often causes wars and deaths of many people.
But nothing is given without paying. And they sacrifice their own lifes and the lifes of other people. That's why, I think, rich people are not happy. Happiness can't based on the suffering of others. The people for their wealth is too high. Is it worth to be paid?
Everybody choses it's own way and makes it's own decision.
Generosity is not a particular feature of rich people. They greed often turns into miser, sometimes accumulation is getting their only aim of life, they don't see anything, but money. The other extreme is unnecessary wastefulness. When people can spend the whole fortune at once instead of giving it to people who really need it.
We can set a great number of examples on the subject taken from our own experience, TV and our classical literature,. But is isn't a lesson for us. The old history has repeated all over again from one generation to another. It is just getting more ingenious.
But it doesn't mean that all people are so rational and cynical. There is another group of people for whom money is just a wad of banknotes the real happyness and the great mission of humanality they see in kindness, mercy and morality. These quolities distinguish them from predatory animals. They can't step ever their principles and prefer to stay poor but pround and honest.
There is such proverb property is not a vice. There work honestly and can look strictly at people's eyes. Proverty stimulates people to improve their lifes.
The peculiarity of human nature is that we always need something. And when we realize our ambitions we have another ones. And we enjoy the process of realizing of our plans, of the foretaste of it. Wealthy people who reached the very top of Olympus have nothing to aim for. That's why they are very unhappy and begin drinking, taking drugs and they even kill themselves. Money destruct inside world and let evil come in.
I don't confess that all rich people are bad. There are many exceptions. Let's take our Decembrists, for example. They were all noblemen and rather rich people. They all had wives and children. They can live calmly. But they couldn't be happy when there are privately, injustice and tragedies around them and they gave their lives in favor of happiness of other people. The Decembrists are very strong with a very high morality.
My ideal of virtue is Princess Diana. She was very kind and rich at the same time, that's a very seldom combination. She did so much ill, indigent people. Her kindness was boundless, she was really ""a queen of people's hearts"".
To seem up the above-mentioned facts, I want to say that money doesn't play the last role in our life, but we should remember that money isn't the main thing on the earth.
It has the double power: money can raise a man but at the same time it destroy him.

Some people say that in our modern world, dominated by science, technology and industrialisation, there is no longer a place for dreaming and imagination. In my opinion, this statement is rather doubtful, although there are certain reasons for some people to think so.
However, if one was asked whether dreaming and imagination still exist and worry the souls of people, he or she would be puzzled and it would be difficult for him or her to give a single ""yes"" or ""no"" answer to this question.
It is really not so easy to define what dreaming and imagination are. Longman's Dictionary of Contemporary English provides us with the following definitions: -Imagination is the ability to form pictures or ideas in your mind about what something could be like.
- And to dream means to think about something that you would like to happen or to think that you have done something that you have not.
Of course, dreaming is a much more complicated concept, it's a psychological phenomenon which is highly individual. Actually, it depends upon the way one sees and appreciates the real world around him or her, and it is obvious for all of us that people's dreams change as the world changes. It is true that the way we dream and the things that we dream of have changed since, for instance, the previous century. But I don't think that there is no place for dreaming and imagination in our modern world at all.
On the one hand, it is common knowledge that these days people do not dream as much as they did a century ago. Examples are numerous. If we turn to different stories written by I.S.Turgenev or A.P.Chekhov, we will find out that many characters of those stories are devoting their lives entirely to dreaming and imagination ( and they are drawn from real life ).
But the world we live in now has changed greately since those times. Today people can't just sit and dream of happy life somewhere in a remote village all day long, they simply don't have time.
On the other hand, we can't say that people have stopped dreaming completely.
Nothing could be further from the truth. We are all human, anybody wants his or her life to become better than it is at the present moment ( actually, this is the main origin, the root of people's unhappiness, and, at the same time, this is the reason for world progress ).
The fact is that the value system has changed since that time. The development of science and technology has consolidated materialism in people's minds, and therefore people's dreams have changed in their content (different details of the dreams), but their essence has remained the same.
In the XIX century people dreamed of love, happy marriage, joyful life close to nature, better living conditions for the whole humanity etc.
At the age of science, technology and industrialisation people pay more attention to material things, but they don't forget, however, about different spiritual values. These days their dreams are very often connected with such things as good career, good house, good car, but nevertheless they still dream of love and happiness as well.
If we turn to modern science fiction like I.Asimov's, R.Bradbury's, P.Anderson's works, we will make sure that people still try to imagine different ways of improving their living conditions. They imagine wonderful towns and countries on a distant planet somewhere in the outer space, they dream of unreal machines which would help people in all their activities. And this field of imagination is very closely connected with science and technology.
In my opinion, imagination is a synonym to creation, because while dreaming of something (real or unreal), we create it in our mind. When a scientist invents something, he always imagines it first and only then makes it.
Frankly speaking, I think that imagination is a gift, a talant. Some people possess vivid and lively imagination, some don't. But practically everybody is able to dream.
Of course, there are different people with different concepts of happiness, different thoughts and emotions. But I can not agree that science, technology and industrialisation can prevent any human being from dreaming of happiness. And I believe that while imagination exists we can be sure that this world also exists.

RUMO9001,3.0,,,,,,All armies should consist entirely of professional soldiers: there is no value in a system of military service,"
Every country in the world has its army for its own security. The army is a face of any country. And unfortunately, nowadays our Russian Army is like the ""hell"". I think it is the best name for such a military service.
All of us know about the most fearful World War of this century when the Soviet Army freed our country from the German invaders. Then it wasn't a professional army, but there were patriotic feelings, love for our country and longing for freedom and victory. In that moment and some years after the war the Soviet Army had a great value in the world. We had a strong army and a strong state.
On the other hand the soldiers were only common people, as a result there was a great number of dead men. We couldn't avoid of them, but I think everybody will agree that quantity of victims would have been less if the soldiers had had a higher professional level. Despite of the absence of such professionalism our nation overcame fascists.
And nowadays look at the Russian Army. It's a pity but we couldn't call it ""the professional army"". Every year the Russian government is going to organize the alternative military service, but everybody can observe that year by year, month by month, day by day youths are taken for doing their military duty. The Military Forces aren't reduced and money for their living aren't given. Russia can't support its army, can't even feed the soldiers in units and military cadets of specialized schools and academies. This fact is a great argument for creating a reduced alternative professional army though for a peaceful period of time. The absence of money and food for Russian units is not the only problem, the principal one is that the Russian Army don't do its duty and don't fulfil its function. It can't bring up real defenders for Russia. On the contrary, it makes these youths disabled persons. They come back home with mental and physical injuries which they damage themselves to each other.
They return with serious deseases or don't return at all. They try to escape and leave this place becoming deserters. Can we call them our defenders? They are martyrs, not soldiers. Can we and they be proud of such a service for the sake of Russia?
Every day we watch TV, we are announced that some soldiers died from hunger, a soldier killed his comrades, a soldier committed a suicide. And it is a shame for the TV and our government when a TV-program shows how well soldiers eat in a unit in the Far East in that moment when there also people of other professions can't get their salary for many months. It is a tragedy for such a country as ours. Let's stop here and look at the professional part of our army - officers. They are also in crisis. My father is a military man, we had to live in different military units, it's not an easy life.
Even in Moscow a lot of his collaborators had to live in hostels with their families, though they had been already serving for a long time. As for the officers who live in the other regions of our great country you can imagine their difficult situation. But high military men, a lot of generals and members of the government, who are responsible for the condition of the Russian Army, live wonderfully, not thinking about the position of our army and promising something to do. In this moment our country needs an educated qualified military minister and full reorganization in army.
Our government must find their own way or though follow one's experience. For example, we could take the US Army's model as the basis. They really have a professional army. People go to do their service consciously. Their work is paid well, the USA prepare good specialists in this sphere. Their army is the real protection and American military men fulfil their duty and guard their nation with pride.
Unfortunately, our army is far away from such a pattern of devoted professional organization.
Of course, everybody wants the changes in the Russian Army. Many common people try to help in this difficult situation ( the Committee of soldiers' mothers). But these troubles don't touch our government. Nothing can help the army while the high instances are thinking only about their own profits, but not about human troubles.
They'll remember about the army only when a war came and it will be a great necessity to save our ""Great"" Russian State. It's a shame for our country and our nation.
P.S. "" If a country doesn't feed its army, it feeds another one"".

RUMO9007,2.5,3.5,,,,,The prison system is outdated. No civilized society should punish its criminals: it should rehabilitate them,"
Sentensed to repentance.
It goes without saying that our society is far from ideal.We pretend to be much different from our primitive forefathers but in fact society on the whole has not changed greatly since those distant ages.The rude primitive man was unconscious of his neighbour's rights.So, trying to survive, he could kill his kingsman,could rob him of a piece of meat or other ""possessions"".We are expected to be the community of highly organized living-beings,whose brains are twice as large,scientists say.For years we have been creating various moral principals and sets of value.And man's rights are said to be of highest value.But in practice we can observe the natural man's rights been neglected every minute.Lots of criminals live among us,some of them were punished,others have not been brought to justice,the rest do not even expect themselves yet to be capable of any crime.Offenses that are committed in every day life are dreadful.Our primitive forefathers with their ""tiny""brains could not even imagine such cruelties.
It is obvious that we should fight against the crime wave that overwhelmed us. How?It is another pair of shoes.But crimes must be eradicated.It can not be denied that any offense,if it is offense according to the standarts of international law ought to be punished.But how to know what the punishment should be?To
punish...But what for?Perhaps to prevent other crimes,to show that one can not get away with it.What form of punishment to choose then?
For a long time death penalty was the principal for most serious crimes.Years ago exercutions were public and were meant to produce threat of the punishment that followed any crime.But in fact public exercutions tended to be just spectacles atended by crowds of people.Since the nineteenth century exercutions have been carried out in privite in prisons.Nowadays most exercutions appear to be for murder.But in our humane,democratic society there is a great deal of debates concerning death penalty as a form of punishment.Those in favour of it claim that capital punishment is the only penalty that adequetely reflects the gravity of the crime commited,of murder in most cases. Some people say that certain murderes do not deserve living.And those against death penalty point out that it creates the risk that an innocent person may be executed.They insist that life imprisonment is a sufficient sanction for serious crimes and they say that capital punishment lowers the community to the same level of behaviour as the criminal.May be there is something in the latter statement.Perhaps one man can't judge another one and pass a sentence to him.May be to let crimes go unpunished?
The community surely has the right to punish some members of it.Well,death is probably a severe penalty,but it is impossible that a crime should go unpunished.Otherwise everyone would do what he thinks is profitable for him,without being afraid of any punishment.A
man would need being a member of society and obey its laws.And out of society,when everyone is his own man,it might occur that homan race would gradually become a hedge of wild animals of some unknown breed.
Well,the idea of imprisonment is another form of punishment.It
is said to be a more democratic sanction than death penalty.However,after it has been admitted in many democratic states,that the prisoner also has rights that are protected by Constitution,there is a great deal of talk about certain drawbacks of the inprisonment system as well.It's necessary that a prisoner should be protected from violence on the part of his fellow-prisoners.But it is difficult to provide the prisoner's safety,as jails are overcrowded and prison population is still growing rapidly.That is why certain deseases are widespread among prisoners.It is uneconomical to keep such a large amount of people in jails.Besides it appears that tax payers work to provide criminals with food and security.
It is not surprising that there are some alternatives to imprisonment for certain criminals.They are expected to make reparation in some practical form for the benefit.of the community (fines,probation resolutions,disqualifications).
But statistics shows that these forms of punishment failed to become an affective deferent to further crime.
It might seem absurd,but many progressive social changes(i.e. an increase of individual liberty) may lead to further increase of crime.Crime is less likely in societies where there are some religious or other restraints on behaviour.But in the modern community,where economical growth and personal success are dominant values,the number of crimes is not likely to reduce.
That is why the purpose of any penalty should be correction rather than punishment.We would like to believe that some time we will build the community in which for each criminal the most severe punishment will be the feeling of remorse,Raskolnikov's inner protest as it were.

Money, money, money... What is money? Money is health, money is pleasure. Money is education, delight, happiness, life. Money is envy, crime. Money is death... So, money is everything. All we have we have for money. If we have money we have everything. But should we have everything? That is the question. The more we have the more we want to have.
Do you want to be rich? - Yes, you do. If you said '' no '' I just wouldn't believe you.
And even if you said to your wife that you don't want to make a fortune your wife would kill you , I assure you. And what do you do to get some money? I'd like to quote a few words from a song: "" I work all night I work all day To pay the bills I have to pay - Isn't it sad?
And still there never seems to be A single penny left for me - That's too bad! ""
Don't you feel the same? You get up before darn and your working day has already begun. You spend the whole day working until absolutely worn out to go out anywhere or to enjoy your family life you fall asleep in an arm chare before your TV set. So you work from dawn till night day after day, week after week and so on , so forth. But what for?
A man's wife watches TV admiring the beautiful life shown in films. And she demands that her husband should work less , pay more attention to her and his children and still he should bring more money. Then he begins to understand that his life is unbearable. His life becomes a torture and... he commits suicide.
But let's talk more seriously. Money is the root of all evil. Do you remember the war in Chechnya? How many people died during that war! A great number of young innocent men, women, children were victims in the hands of our government. The leaders of our country made a pile by sacrificing their own people. And you know that most of the wars broke out because someone wanted to conquer new territories, nations and become the greatest in the word.
Vanity, the wish to have power, money, push a man to destroy the life of other people. For example lets speak about drug tradesmen. They make people their slaves.
For a grate sum of money a man allows himself to induce another person to lead a pitiable existence, to turn the other's life to dreadful torture. And what about drug addicts? They feel drug-made delight, pleasure, joyfulness for a few hours and they go to rob or even kill innocent people to get some money which they will pay for rotten drugs in order to forget the cruel world in their false dreams.
People steal information from each other. Then they sell it. And it doesn't matter to them why others buy that information and what they are going to do with it.
A lot of our sportsmen emigrated to the countries where they could make more money. They sell themselves, they sell their motherland. Isn't it sad?
We are the slaves of money. Even if we had fair money and we could enjoy them Could be proud of them, could we be happy knowing that other people suffer?
Money is the root of all evil. But we have no power to change it. People are too imperfect to live without money. We live for ourselves. It's against our nature. Do you remember the dream about socialism where all people are equal? To build that world was a great mistake for us.
Our vanity push us to struggle for a place under the sun. But isn't it the law of nature?
Don't animals struggle for their life? Of course animals have no money. But people are more complicated creatures than animals. So we invent end money. Animals struggle for their life without money and people struggle with the help of them.
So, what is money? Is it the way of our existence? Money seems to be the root of our rotten life full of cruelty and evil. But history knows the examples or it's better to say attempts of building society without money. They were all a crash. Then maybe the root of all evil is human nature, not money?

RUMO9012,1.5,2.5,,,,,Feminists have done more harm to the cause of women than good,"
To say the truth it took me much time to think over this state- ment, mayby because in our country the problem of feminism is not so popular as in Europe or in the USA. It happens that it is accepted to suppose that after the Great October Socialist Revolution men and wo- men are equal in their rights. And it was really like that. With the 20ies we were in the era of the ""emancipated"" woman. The had the vote.
She also had short hair and lipstick. Young women with jobs did not have to marry the first man who asked them.There were also protests over inequities of jobs and wages and there was a hard-fought battle paralleling the current strugle for abortion reform over birth cont- rol. Then it was the War which drew women into industry and for the first time in history into the armed forces on a par with men. As for the present I am a woman and I do not feel any infringement of my rights only becaus I am a womam. As for the civilized countries I think it is just the same: women are challenging and overturning the status quo in all fields from politics and business to sports and me- dicine, reshaping and recasting the social, political and economic trends of the day. Now the statementthat all that the women wish to have must come through a single channel and single choice: wealth, po- wer, social distinction, fame and even home and happiness, reputation, ease and pleasure, their bread and butter- all must come to them thro- ugh a small gold ring- is really out of date and unpopular. In this case if a woman can be elected to higher office, can occupy top corpo- rate posts and own successful business she can do whatever she wants and she has the equal rights with men, I do not see any reasons for feminists to be indignant. So if we are talking about the present I do not think the feminism has done either harm or good, but if we are talking about the feminism in the historical aspect I am just sure that it has done only good. Let's look at the social image of women in the last several generations. The first thing we discover is that the scholary historians who deride the idea of a special history of women are quite correct. Women have not been trend-setters, activists in the drama of great events. If they turn up in the middle of some climalic scene they are likely to have got there by the accident of marriage or occasionally of birth. Women-monarches have inherited power under laws made by men, not laid hands on it themselves. The history of women has not been made within their own ranks but has followed from the ma- le-initiated proced. Women's history is fragmented, interrupted; a shadow history of human beings whose existence has been shaped by the efforts and the demands of othere. As for the fight of women for their rights it involved more then a struggle for tangible goals like equal pay, equal opportunity, the vote it self. It was a fight for the very right to fight, to declare that one's ambitions and needs are as im- portent as those of men. Women were so isolated that the world could practically run without them exept for their services as domestic drudges. Millions of women knew from their own experience that ""equal rights for women"" was a phrase but not a fact. The women's movement was a search for a more honorable and worthy life. Yes it ""was"" and maybe now it is just the time to stop the search and look around, may- be it is the time when men and women should bury the hatchet and live in peace and harmony. Now women are vital, courageous, independent, fully equal strong but at the same it seems they do not have delicacy, sensitivity and gentleness without which our sexiness and strength, courage and independence are a hollow pose. So I do not deny femi- nists' services I just want to say that women should not forget that they are women and should nurture in themselves a kind of indomitab- le,gentle spirit that must be made more widely available, in order to, inspire a new generation of women, not by glossing over the dark rea- lities we can not afford to ignore, but by reminding us that reality is both dark and bright, and that to live with both requires courage.

RUMO9014,2.5,2.5,2.0,2.0,2.0,1.5,"In the words of the old song: ""Money is the root of all evil""","
Once upon a time there lived a beautiful young woman and a handsome young man.
They were deeply in love with each other and wanted to get married, but unfortunately they were very poor. But young peoples' parents objected to there marriage. They told that it would be better for their children to wait till they get a good job with good prospects. So the young people waited until they found good jobs with good prospects and they were able to get married. But, of course, they were still poor. They didn't have a house to live in or any furniture, but that didn't matter. The time went by and the young man was hired to a company, so a bank lent him the money he needed to buy a house, some furniture, a car and all the latest electrical appliances. The couple lived happily and paid off their debts for the rest of their lives.
And so ends a modern romantics fable.
But it is a fallacy to suppose that all people are like this couple. I think that young generation doesn't want to live in such a way. And the only thing people are interested in today is earning more money, I believe.
Everybody knows that money opens a lot of roads. You can get a good education, have a fashionable house, a fine car and the way like this. Your friends are usually rich too, and sometimes you forget about your poor friends. And this is not amazing.
We live in a materialistic society and are trained from our earliest years to be acquisitive. The terms ""mine"" and ""yours are clearly labeled from early childhood.
When we grow old enough to earn our living, it does not surprise us to discover that success is measured in terms of the money you earn. And here we become jealous and competitive. I think that everybody has at least once caught himself on thought that we spend the whole our lives keeping up with our neighbours, the Ivanovs. If we buy a new TV-set, Ivanov is bound you buy a bigger and better one. If we buy a new car, we can be sure that Ivanov will get two new cars: one for his wife and one for himself.
On the other hand, this materialistic outlook has seriously influenced education.
Fewer and fewer young people nowadays acquire knowledge only for its own sake.
Every course of studies must lead somewhere; namely to a bigger wage. The problem of shortage of skilled-personnel is solved now the way like this: big companies complete with each other to recruit students before they have completed their studies.
Tempting salaries and different kinds of benefits are offered to them. This recruiting tactics have led to the ""brain drain"", the process by which highly skilled people offer their services to the highest bidder. As a result, the wealthier nations deprive their poorer neighbours of their most prominent citizens.
Believe me or not, but trying to earn more money, in this crazy money race, we often forget about people, their feelings and emotions. People today are angry, again because of money. A passion for money has become a modern phenomenon. And this is rather painful, because this phenomenon occurs in our country, especially after the last economic crisis in August.
Let me show you another example. After the August events this problem has become one of the most critical ones. A lot of employment agencies closed and job-hunting has become practically impossible without having good old boy connections. But as you know not everybody can afford such a thing. This forces people to brake the law.
A desire to have some money make them to commit crimes such as possession of drugs, murders, extortion, larceny, burglary, robbery, kidnapping and so far so force.
To recapitulate, I think that in most cases money brings people more harm than good.
But should we remember about it when we feel cash in our pocket? Should we think of people, their souls and problems?
Everyone has a right to choose.

SPM01005,3.0,2.5,,,,,Feminists have done more harm to the cause of women than good,"
The statement ""feminists have done more harm to the cause of women than good"" is false. In fact, feminists are the ones who have fought and managed an improvement of women's situation in society, although there is still a hard work to do. In order to support this argument, we are going to review the following subjects: Labour discrimination, the right to vote, the fight against male chauvinist behaviours, the representation of women in important political charges and the recognition of the sexuality in woman.
Nowadays, the Spanish Law penalizes sexual discrimination as for labour. The last sentences are becoming favourables to women. A few weeks ago, for instance, an enterprise has been charged with paying more money to men than to women, when both accomplished the same work. Other theme to be discussed is the women's right ~o vote, which has to do with the equality in the rights of the State. feminist pressures were used for the recognition of women's sufrage in Spain, in 1931. Besides, thanks to the fight of feminist groups, more reactionarity male shauvinist behaviours are denounced, the agressions are reported, and rapings are punished with greater severity, although there are exceptions, as always. To take an obvious example, a few years ago, and even today in some cases, the girl who wore a mini-skirt was the real guilty of her raping. Moreover, in the present political parties (especially in those which are situated in the center-left wing), women begin to be considered when taking important decisions. In an increasing way, women request more participation in the direction organs. In Spain we have three women who hold the charge of ministers in our government. But the world of women is still a dropout in the political world. At last, we must state that it is due to the feminist struggle that the sexuality of women is put on the same level as masculine one, and it is not so hidden. Before this, man could enjoy with his sex and be proud of his potency (or prepotency} whereas woman, had as her only function in society, that of procreating. With the sexual liberation, women advanced towards the knowledge and experimentation of their own body.
Therefore, the equality of wages, the right to vote, the consideration of women as inferior and less intelligents beings, the higher percentage of participation of women in charges with power of decision, and the fact of recognising their own sexuality are some of the consequences of the feminist fight since it, the oldest revolution of this century, began. Two weeks ago, I concentrated with some women to protest against two men who had raped a girl. They are free because she was scared and left to her country; therefore, the denounce has being stopped. Then the evidence is clear , there is no doubt that there was a rape, even from the point of view of the law. But in a legal way there is nothing to be done: only to demonstrate your rage for another injustice committed against women. This act has done more harm to the cause of women than good: from the rapers' point of view. That's why I am a militant feminist.

SPM01006,3.0,,,,,,"In his novel ""Animal Farm"" George Orwell wrote ""All men are equal but some are more equal than others"". How true is this today?","
How many times have we heard the sage:""I have my rights, since I pay my taxes?"". Probably, thousands of times. Nevertheless, hardly ever is this utopian idea fulfil, above all for those persons who share the status of being common citizens. In fact, the civil rights are achieved in a country, by means of an external condition, which is based on the economical power of the individuals. If you are one of those who have a healthy current account, then, you could regard yourself as being extremely lucky. Immediately, all doors which were shuted up for other people, will open just for you. And, in this case, there is no point in complaining continually if you are not one of the elected, for the medium citizen is accustomed to these social inequalities. We must resign ourselves not to having their rights, musing about the fact that, if we were them, we would do the same.
All these factors contribute to the enhancement of the discrimination and racism between the poor and those who have more financial resources. For instance, it is not very far from us, the state of affairs related to Mario Conde, the former president of Banesto. This man was supposed to be an upright personality, however, he has turned out to be a fiasco. Not onlv did he made investments in companies which he does not registered, but he also used the shareholders'money in his own benefit.
I am afraid that this practice is becoming very common among some individuals who own a"" stainless behaviour"". But, which is the reward that these kind of people should achieve when they pilfer from our pocket? At first sight, it seems extremely comforting to think about the fact that there are people who lack of the primary resources for their living and that, in the meanwhile, there are other persons who have swindled us out of money and are supported by higher institutions. Then, what should we expect from those apparatuses which, theoretically, are caring for our interests? If it be so, then I should rather prefer emigrating to any other country.
In the present days, it is in fashion to discuss about the exemplary behaviours of Mariano Rubio and Manuel de La Concha. Both of them are in tight conexion with the Ibercop case. Once again, the public opinion can observe how the Law deals with these frauds, protecting and covering them up. It is quite amazing to notice the instruments that the society spreads out in order to protect itself against the nigh perils, especially from those which come from other continents. Really, we all consider that these emigrants are trying to take our properties away, like our money or even though our job. So, we do not want them to live here with us, since they represent a clear menace to our security. However, we all do know that this situation will keep on, until the people who are requiring their cheaper labour, accept to rise their salaries, too. If this fact does not happen, then the holdsups will increase and nothing will be able to prevent them from occuring. Nevertheless, we see one more time, how the powerful individuals can murder without any fear of being punished. We must remember cases such as Carlos Sainz'father to be able to appreciate the unbalance existent among the individuals. If a diplomatic can murder a negro with his gun because he wanted to steal a woman's handbag, then, there is nothing left to do. As if we were living in Chicago, people in Spain should be taught the irrational skill of murdering.

SPM01007,3.0,2.0,,,,,"Some people say that in our modern world, dominated by science and technology and industrialisation, there is no longer a place for dreaming and imagination. What is your opinion?","
It has not been possible to discover the limits of the imagination yet, therefore, I do not believe that some scientific advances can set the boundaries. The technological progress make dreams come true quicker than ever, thus, they are in the service of the imagination. While human thought is subject to man and not machines, there will be imagination and , so, evolution.
We start from the point that ""to imagine"" is the mental faculty which represents images of things. To imagine is to represent a thing in an ideal way by means of some images.
Some of the most revolutionary scientific advances in the twentieth century are the ones related to the information technology. If we apply the previous definition of the verb to imagine, to these adavances, we will have a vast field of images to develop our imagination. Also, if we add that man, by nature, dreams, that is, represents events in the fantasy while he is sleeping, to my understanding, we have a clear conclusion. While man exist, he will dream and consequently, he will develop his imagination.
The images to combine are more and better with the current resources, so, man will imagine in better ways.
I don not think than human being can't ever stop dreaming or imagining, except that, something or someone dreams or imagines by themselves, that is to say, something that transmit them what they have to dream. It is so, because the imagination is innate in all human beings. In the case of existing such advances, it will have to dream or give us something that replaces our dreams. But to do so, unreal things, desirable and better than the present ones, it has to be varied because it doesn't exist nor it won't exist nothing of what people don't get bored or tired although it was perfect.
Apart from being varied, these variations can't simply be at random because, as it happens in fashion, the final result come from certain patterns that even are not established. Besides, they are thought or imagined without any kind of combination that was already done.
In that case, I do believe that it will not exist a machine or something able to imitate the human imagination.
We can go further, simply by imagining a real mechanical, electronical and dominated world by the industry, in which all of a necessities are covered by the machines, even that they can evolve by themselves. In that situation, man would find that the only possible thing to do for him is just dream and imagine in other worlds. It will never happen because we would get tired and wanted to change it because of our characteristic way of being.
Within few years, the virtual reality, for example, will allow us to live, experience, do and represent dreams and imaginative ideas in a fictitious way. It will make us to go further quickly. But, not because of that, man will stop dreaming, but all the opposite. He will have to dream to be able to manage the machine. First to make true his dreams, we have to have them.

Not everybody is worried about the prison system. But it is an important subject to be taken into account. It is a common feature in human nature to be concerned with the problems which they are closely related to, But, what is the use of bothering?. At the end of the eighteenth century, Voltaire, Rousseau and Montesquieu promoted the idea of prison as a mechanism of rehabilitating delinquents, As Rousseau told in his book Le Emile, humans are good by nature, but society corrupts them. The question in matter is to know if the goal of imprisionment is to rehabilitate or to punish. The nowadays society is getting more and more retrogressive and agree with getting rid of ""this disturbing people"" and enclose them, the farther, the better, The prison system is a controversial issue. First of all, a part of the sector of the society is pro prison as a good method to punish the criminals. An eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth; if someone kills s/he has to be killed, however, it does not make sense that what someone is against at, makes exactly the same, We can clearly see that this is not a solution at all, Other sector consider prison as a warning, a way of preventing people from commiting offences, It is true that there are persons who would do atrocities if prison would have not created that now they do not do. On the contrast, it has been proved that normally, the fact of going to prison does not refrain people from making a crime. A society should not punish its crimials, it should rehabilitate them.
0n the other hand, rehabilitate lawbreakers is not as easy is it looks like. First of all, a great amount of money would be necessary, and if so, it would last long time. Prison, that should be a way of integration, has turned to a vicious circle. People who go to Jail do not rehabilitate, quite the opposite. Sometimes non guilty persons go to prison and they become corrupted there. Also, when an exconvict is looking for a job, s/he can find many problems, because people are very reluctant to do it. So, integration is a very hard task.
To sum up, we live in a world where there are more and more problems, such as delinquence, dropouts, a calamitous administrative policy. There is no money and it is necessary to look for a good solution. Prison is nowadays a fixed and a consolidated institution and it is almost impossible to change it. However, it is worthwhile and with everybody's effort we can manage to obtain it and live in a better world with a common work.

SPM01012,3.5,2.5,,,,,Most university degrees are theoretical and do not prepare students for the real world. They are therefore of very little value,"
It is easy enough to make broad generalisations about the mistakes in the present-day education system at universities, but in reality the issue is an extremely complex one. How prepared are the students when they finish their degree at university.? Do they receive a practical or a theoretical preparation in their years at university.? Are they prepared to face the real world once they've got a degree under their arms.?...This brings us to the question whether the university system should change.
Since we are children, we are said that the most important thing in life is education. It doesn't matter how much effort we have to put in it and how much work we have to do to achieve the so wanted degree but we should go for it, then as anyone living in a competitive society where only the best ones get what they are fighting for, we believe in those claims and assume our role as students, as people fighting for that ""valuable status"" you get when leaving university, and that it will help you to live a better life. But is this completely true.? Until what point the fact of being a graduate student means that we are well prepared, that we are more qualified to do a job than other person who did not have the opportunity of attending university.? On the other hand, that person probably has more practical experience than the one we've got. And why.? we can wonder... simply because while we were cramming for years they already had a post in which they had been acquiring practical knowledges.
To illustrate the truth of this, one has only to mention people's dissapointment when realizing how little value has the time spent at university. A recent newspaper article claimed that a very high percent of graduate students believe that they know nothing about what they have been taught in their years in the campus, and, more and more of them are joining postgraduate courses in order to extend their lives as students and avoid, doing this, the terrible moment of looking for a job within a society where unemployment is increasing everyday - which brings us to another side of the question: Is our attitude as passive students the correct one.?
It is undoubtedly true that things could improve, that a solution should be found so as to fix a balance between the theoretical knowledges and the practical ones that we acquire at university. One might reasonably suppose that practical courses at university would help a lot to attenuate this unbalance and to strengthen the validity of the system.
My personal opinion of this argument is that as the tittle says most university degrees are theoretical and of very little value. There are exceptions, of course, such as the great majority of private institutions which give to their students the opportunity of putting into practice the knowledges they receive by supplying them professional training in different firms...but What about the rest of the people who cannot afford going to these kind of centres.? Are they going to have equality of opportunity.? Probably, they are not.
The key to this whole problem must surely be the development of a new educational system which without leaving the acquisition of theoretical knowledges apart would pay more attention to the decisive importance of a good practical training of the students.

SPM01013,3.0,3.0,,,,,"In the words of the old song: ""Money is the root of all evil""","
The clich that ""money is the root of all evil' has become in human history much more than a saying picked up by chance from an old song, but a reality which even more noticeable in modern times.
Money is generally regarded as a priceless key to unlock the slammed-shut doors which one encounters in daily life. Hence there is nothing that materialistic people would not be willing to do to obtain it. There exist positive means of earning money; working with endurance, integrity and good motivation seem to be the most worthy. Nevertheless exist other means of obtaining it which are not so honorable, but quicker. These means have become prominent in present day society.
These days society is evidently led by tendencies of consumption unknown before. During the Roman Empire, the Middle Ages and The lndustrial Revolution for instance, the boundaries between classes were completly separated and only a few fortunate members of the groups in power were aware of and could enjoy the delights wealthiness could provide. Today the means of communication transmit the excelencies of a glamorous world to those who find it hard to make ends meet. Hence the phrases ' I own"", 'I possess"" are becoming the guiding lights of a broad sector of society.
It is an unknown fact that to own and to posses one has to buy and that requires money. How does one find money? It is precisely at this point that evil is likely to make its apperance onto the stage especially because the cycle of money dictates that when money enters the hands of one it leaves the pocket of another. The trick is how to convince others to let loose their pockets. Even with in the limits of the legal methods of finding money there exist hidden tactics to seize the money of others. For instance, marketing is a means of making a piece of merchandise look wonderful and absolutely necessary for our existence, when the truth is the contrary. Are these methods of using propaganda in adverdsing to sell at all cost absolutely legal?.
However publicity and marketing are minor ""crimes"" when compared to violence, death, war, deprivation of human rights and other horrors which are aimed at the attainment of money, it seems that the value of human life diminishes as the value of money increases.It is then that homo lupu homini est may be applied to the definition of human behaviour. At this disgraceful view of human nature, man's blood stained hands rise proudly showing their ignominious award.
Nonetheless, it may be adduced that not always behind a violent act is an uncontainable lust for the acquisition of money or power. It may be alleged that nonmaterialistic ideological motives can prompt persons to get engaged in actions which endanger other people's basic rights even that of life. However, how many of those people do not conduct themselves by an ideal, but are subtly manipulated by the desires to accomplish the aims of an economical gain?.
In spite of all the vile acts and corruption which surround the world of money, it would be unfair not to acknowledge the altruistic purposes which lead some individuals or organisations to put their or other's money at the service of the needy ones.
These non-profit organisations are the most outstanding proof of the praisable actions which can be carried out thanks to money. Money can help to mitigate manu disabilities, calamities and much suffering where its lack is source of a continuous state of misfortune and afliction.
In conclusion, it must be taken into consideration that although the allure of money compells human beings to do wrong beyond any limits, in the long term money is neither good or bad itself but persons and their actions determine the role money play in the world.

SPM01016,3.0,,,,,,Feminists have done more harm to the cause of women than good,"
Feminist and feminism are words which have been used in a pejorative way; they have been used as synonyms of mannish women, and it is not true.
If one looks back in former times, or even nowadays, one can find many situations, actions, and details which show how women were and are still being exploited, ill-treated and underestimated. Women are 2nd class citizens, and that is why ""we must put up with anything, and what is more, we must be grateful to this manly society which permits us to do all the work that is rejected by men"".
In the Middle Ages, women were decorative ornaments to be shown and made use of. They had neither opinion nor mind, but men were completely wrong. Although women were not asked, they gave some answers, and it was thank to the help of feminists that women have reached some rights.
I do not think feminists have done more harm to the cause of women than good, but I think male chauvinists have done it.
Men were who said the rules, who had the money, and the political power.
... and women had nothing (no money, no rights .....). Suddenly, women found out that they were ""human beings"", that they could be as intelligent, enterprising and capable as men. Women wanted to wear jeans and to show that they were worthy of respect (they asked for an opportunity to get what was a right). Feminists fought, and they were despised, but some important triumphs were obtained such as: the voting right, their independence ....Feminists opened women's eyes to something which we have been prevented from. Since then, many women are following their example, although there are still many difficulties.
A distinction between radical feminists and 'feminists' ought to be made. Radical feminists push men away. Men are women's fiends and women want to demonstrate that we are exactly the same as they are.
I consider myself a feminist; I believe in women and in our rights, and I would like to be considered as capable as a man, but it does not mean that men and women are totally ""equal"" . Our nature is different, as well as our physical characteristics (We are complementary opposites), but in relation to our mental capacities no distinction ought to be made, being considered equal to men, it is the least one can expect. Nowadays, many women have finished their ""fight"" because they believe women have obtained the bulk of the aims, but it is not enough.
Many other women like being treated in the old manner, they like being ""protected and spoiled"" by their husbands, and they can not understand the way in which feminists act.
To sum up, feminists have fought and sacrificed many things in order to provide us with a better way of living, and it seems to me that it would not be fair if we accused them of having done harm to us. Women's lack of decision, our cowardness, and our malleability have done a lot of damage to the cause of women, as well as the masculine mind which governs our society.

SPM01017,4.0,3.0,,,,,"Some people say that in our modern world, dominated by science and technology and industrialisation, there is no longer a place for dreaming and imagination. What is your opinion?","
Two very basic ideologies lie behind tha History of Humankind. It is the struggle between the two of them which makes our society evolve creating, this way, our history. These two ideologies are ""the Progressive"" and ""the Traditionalists"". There is of course, a whole range of possibilities between them, but all moving within the espectrum of what we could characterise + traditionalist.
During the current century, technological advances have been so atonishing that the ""slow"" traditionalists have been struck with so many new gadgets and goods. So much is this the case that their idea of keeping a ""moderate"" pace in their motion and evolution has been utterly impossible.
Life has become a kind of race in which the human mind is battered with images and ideas at such speed that assimilation seems hard to believe. The mind has no time for its own, and , this way, no self ideas are created. Logically, no imagination or dreams are produced by those brains overflooded by external data. I believe this to be the logical succession of ideas in the minds of those traditionalists, who attack technological advances, which are beyond their level of understanding due to the quick development of science in the present century.
Allow me first to consider the definition of imagination, and then I will be in a position to proof them right or wrong. The first thing I read in my dictionary when looking at the word imagination is: ""The ability that you have to think of and form pictures or ideas in your mind of things that are very different, interesting, exciting"". *
How does a scientist come up with an invention without the use of imagination? Are not all unbelievable advances (computers, chips, spaceships,...) products of somebody's imagination? Is not, in fact, the XXth century tha moment of History in which more advances have taken place and more discoveries have been made, in comparison with the rate in which the past proceeded? I can only think that people who believe in the lost of imagination due to our technological world are not considering the very evolution of our society as a product itself of our collective and individual imagination.
* Collins Cobuild English Language Dictionary (1987), William Collins Sons and Co. Ltd.
Permit me to forget about this conception of imagination and think of it only as a synonym of dream: a dream is ""an imaginery series of events that you experience in your mind (while you are asleep)""**, reads the dictionary. And then it classifies it as a near synonym of unreality (the parenthesis within the definition are mine, considering that nowadays the fact of dreaming while awake has become part of our schema for ""dream""). And what are the artistic manifestations but the attempt to evoke those dreams, to express those fictitious ideas that wander in the mind of the artist?
Let us compare, then, the amount of artists and movements within the different dimensions of art (literary, musical, pictorial, ...) that existed in the previous centuries with those that occur now, in the current century. Only with a superficial glance at the gallery of main artists of our times can we outnumber the ones of previous centuries. Is that a sign of this ""lack"" of imagination? Who are they but the emblems of imagination? All unique, sigular, exclusive,... all human, in fact. For, what are all of us, each of us who walk about the world, but individual warriors og imagination who defend it scrupulously every second of our lives!
'It is imagination a very distinctive feature of the human': this idea rattles in my mind continuously. I look for my dictionary again and search for human, humankind, mankind,... but no account of imagination is taken. And I hear a cry in my mind, a claim that says that we are nothing but imagination.

SPM01018,3.5,3.0,,,,,"Some people say that in our modern world, dominated by science and technology and industrialisation, there is no longer a place for dreaming and imagination. What is your opinion?","
Imagination is the force that makes us blossom like flower buds. I an convinced of it and , what is more, nobody would disagree if they stopped to think about it. Dreams are the instruments of imagination, through them we begin to give shape to all the formless ideas that wander in our brain.
These are such poetic notions that everybody will laugh at them, no doubt of it. Or maybe nearly everybody, since it is generally considered that imagination and dreams have definitively come to an end and , what is worse, it does not seem to be of any importance to those who consider it to be true.
And why have we come to such a conclusion? Materialism is the key word. It cannot be denied that many of us consider worthless what is not useful, or at least, what we believe to be so. The answer to the question "" what is imagination for?"" has not got a strightforward reply. Only if we reflect on it carefully we realise that the most brilliant human achievements are based on it : men dreamed of planes before thay could fly on them. No matter how much knowledge we have about something, if we do not manage to put it to good use, we will not be able to make it work. And this can pnly be achieved through imagination.
To think is to live and to dream is to be human. Imagination cannot be regarded as essential only because of its inmediate beneficial effects but because of its ""inner"" self as well. Scientists are not certain about animals but we are sure to be able to make up undiscovered worlds never visited only closing our eyes and setting our mind in motion. This faculty cannot be undervaluated since it permits us something as simple as to be on the watch, taking it for granted that sooner or later new things will arrive and we must be prepared to face them. Imagination does not let people rest on their laurels: it foretells them what is still to come.
Imagination is not only attached to the scientific environment but also to the artistic one. What would it be of cinema, literature and art in general without it ? This side of our lives cannot be dismissed. To create art is to communicate messages that could not be expressed in any other way. And most of the times we forget that behind the great novel or the marvellous symphony that have bewitched us, imagination has played a main part.
The role of imagination has been clarified, when to make use of it is something to be pursued at any time or place. Nowadays we are much more worried about looking ahead than inside us. In doing so, we lack a sense of perspective that once lost is not easy to recover. Imagination and material development fit well with each other only if we manage to handle them accurately. The fact that the latter tends to eliminate the former has nothing to do with them but with our stubborn obsession of turning everything upside down.

SPM02002,3.5,1.5,,,,,"In the words of the old song: ""Money is the root of all evil""","
For beginning, we can sy that this phrase (""Money is the root of all evil"") has much to do with the reality and the society in which we live.
Currently, we can get news such as that one in which members of a family quarrelled because of prize money won in football pools; one of the members promised to share his prize but at the end he didn't.
In other cases, a lot of people have lost all their possessions because of their anxiety to play. They have problems with their families, friends and at work. So they need help to feel that play is not the most important thing in this life.
Nowadays, the lives of professionals such as stockbrokers are completely centred on money, so, they aren't interested in things like humanity, and envy is one of their problems. Stockbrokers are men with no scruples and their obsession is to get whatever they want although it means that the lives of other people are destroyed. And also there is a feeling that the values society places upon a person's work have become odd. However, there is one fundamental point to be said in favour of the stockbrokers and their contemporaries in other professions. They have done no more than go out and try to better themselves by hard work.
Money means power and everybody is trying to get enough money to feel that he has a consolidated position in which he has not many problems. This is no bad. But the problem emerges when we put money over virtues such as respect for the others.
We know that money is necessary in our society but that doesn't mean that money has to be the centre of all our desires and projects. This is an easy way of saying it but the reality is very different. Society makes the members of it to follow all its commands. We don't try to say that from this moment we don't have to earn money, but a clear statement is: money doesn't always bring happiness. Here, some people would say that money helps to get it. It's true, we can't live without money. Thus, we have to use money to make our lives easier but not to put down other people.
In conclusion, we can say that men has much to do with many problems that we find in our society but envy is an important part of them. We have to try to feel satisfied with our possessions although they could better. That doesn't means that we don't have wishes and hopes to improve them, that it is associated with our personal improvement and this aspect it is very important in our lives and what we expect from them. So we need to value our posibilities to know where we can get and not to fall in the wrong feeling that everything is possible with money (here we can think about the film ""Indecent proposition"").

SPM02003,2.0,2.0,,,,,"Some people say that in our modern world, dominated by science and technology and industrialisation, there is no longer a place for dreaming and imagination. What is your opinion?","
Hnderlich said once that ""man is a God while dreaming and a beggar while reflecting"".
Thanks to dreaming and reflection, thanks to imagination and science, has man been able to make progress and discover unlimited possibilities.
While dreaming and reflection were joined, while imagination and science were just one, there were no beggars, there were only gods looking for progress: the aim was to improve, trying to find out how far we could get, and being the new discoveries of great service to mankind.
The first human gods started imagining the fire; they imagined techniques in order to get everything easier; they imagined unthinkable ways of transport and even they came to imagine the conquest of the unknown space.
But all this had been imposible without the help of science, both worked together and mankind developed in such a way that everything seemed possible.
However there was a moment in that way where imagination and reflection split up, and then, for the first time, beggars appeared.
Those who used to imagined, still considered man as their main end, while those that were used to reflecting, forgot that technique and technology ahould also have in mind human being as their only goal. This was also the moment when such beggars were absorved by their own progress.
The way changed the direction and focused on power, money and submission.
Now each of us is obliged to choose one of these two ways. Some continued to risk their lives following the way of dreaming, and what they found was a winding path full of obstacles and drawbacks, a way in loneliness that not everyone is able to finish.
Others chose the materialistic way, having the support of the vast majority, where everything is easier because a lot of people still think that the majority must be always right.
The two ways became so separated that occasionally the new improvements are not made for man but against him, and then the question would not be where imagination is, but where human being is.
Beggars of reflection have power and often they use it in such a wrong way that make Gods of imagination become slaves or just disappear.
These words do not intend to be an absurd apology of imagination against technology because both are necessary and we can not go without any of them, but it would be good to think about the necessity of joining imagination and technology again.
Even students, as part of society, have on their hands the duty of abolishing labels: At present, degrees related to science are synonym of future, while those related to Art and Humanities are considered a waste of time, even worse, something completely useless for society.
To such extent has this division became important that the own rules of society make young people decide their future based on false ideologies which quite often involve deception and failure.
All of us have forgotten that the most important part of ourselves is something that Maths can not calculate, it is the place where technology is forbidden and feelings have nothing to do with rules and rational explanations.
Fortunately there are still awake dreamers that forget materialism because the only thing they want is to enjoy life, trying to understand its meaning, there are also poets who find magic in a sunset, or in a flower or even in something so unfashionable as love.
Probably between the thick smoke from the chimeneys of progress, each of us dreams with the real meaning of life following the way of gods, which can only be reached in loneliness and through imagination.

Money is necessary in order to live in our modern society. It is obvious. Commerce and Economy are based upon money.
When people have little money, this money is more likely to be spent in primary needs (just to eat,dress; That's to say ""to live"").
The other way round can occur when money is easily obtained. I mean, when a person is rich from his birth.
I think that money gained without much effort is possibly to be spent inadequately. In these cases,money turns out to have little value, and rich people can often appear as money-slaves. These people may create some needs that don't really exist. And this is a closed circle in which they have to consume more and more, but without feeling pleasure in this consumerism.
Money can also be a vice. The one who has money wants more and more, and no-one is happy with what he-she has.
Money is not bad in itself. But the way one uses it can make noney appear as dangerous. Money is behind the majority of murders, assassinations, robberies,assaults...
Rich Nations-poor Nations: And here it comes the exploitation. It is a serious problem. Money is in between too.
This exploitation is specially dramatic when it has to do with children. There are lots of children without hope.
Within every poor country, there are a few people, mainly the Governors, who are very rich, while the rest of the country is dying because of staruation, lack of water, diseases such as diarrhea and deshidration, due to contaminated food and water. Measles and tetanus,along with diphtheria, whooping cough, polio and other diseases, are preventable through immunization, again relatiuely cheap.
Countries spend great amounts of money on military expenditures and, at the same time, people live at or below the poverty line.
If this trend continues, millions of children will die, most of them unnecessarily, of illness or famine, or malnutrition.
There is a neglection by Governments, more preoccupied with politics, guns and national debt, and they doesn't care.
Some children, to escape from misery, have to work from a very early age. But the people uho employ them doesn't care. In some cases, the types of work these children are offered, are very risky ones.
The majority of them are low paid. They must work to stay alive. They have no option.
Drugs are also a very serious problem, and it is in some way, related to money as well. Drug adicts need money in order to buy drugs. And it's a great business for drug-dealers.
Experts note that passport and inmigration controls have never been very helpful in stopping drug-dealers.
Inmigration is due to lack of resources, lack of resources, lack of money as well. Poor people cross borders to escape from poverty. Although they know it can be risky, they take these big risks. For example, people from Cuba try to go to The United States by boat, and the same happens to people from Morocco trying to go to Spain by boat. Some of them die; others are taken back to their countries, and those who have better luck, succeed in their purpose.
They look for a better life, but it is not very easy. They'll find a lot of troubles and problems, specially at the beginning. Then, they'll get used to their new life, and things will go better for them.

As a matter of fact, it is still completely true.
Animal Farm was first published in August 1945, only fourty-nine years ago. It is a short period of time and men have not had enough time to change. To speak frankly, I think men have not changed since they appeared on Earth. It is true that a lot of time has passed since then. I cannot deny that human beings have evolved a great deal. New discoveries are made day after day. This can be easily proved only by looking back one generation: our parents did not have the same luxuries we have now. As we all know this has happened because our brain has improved a lot since the beginnig of times and this is excellent. We can be very proud of this, but if we are so progressive, so rational, Why are there still wars, murders, discrimination...?
In my opinion the problem is that our heart has not changed.
Men were, are and will be selfish, ambitious, anxious of power...( the list would be too long for this essay) But nowadays we think we are open to everybody without considering their differences...There are organizations whose work is to fight for the rights of the people, to avoid discrimination. But the results are really discouraging.
It is quite obvious that everyone is different: there are different nationalities, different colours, different religions, even different cvstoms in the same country, and if we are as rational as we think we are that would be considered something wonderful, admirable. Isn't it marvellous to live in a world where we can meet people with other ideas, opinions, cultures?. The cultural exchange can be very profitable for everybody.
This world would be boring if we were all the same without diverse colours, religions, customs, ideas. As I see it, it is impossible to discuss with anybody who has exactly the same ideas but of course some people could think that this way we all would be equal, but as I understand it all men are already equal, we are all human beings, different outside but equal inside.
But that is not what I see everyday. The reality is that some men always try to dominate, control other men who are not so strong, so powerful. As the song says:"" Everybody wants to rule the world"". And that can be good for animals. Among them there are always the strongest ones who survive and the weakest ones who are eliminated because there is not a place for weakness. But we are rational animals, we can think, or at least that is what we are told everyday, and we should know that our duty is to protect the ones who are too weak to defend themselves, but this is too easy to forget when we try to get something and there is somebody between what we want and us.
It is always us, us, and us; well, we think about the others when we can manipulate them and then throw them away.
As the world is organized today there is not a place for equality; but it is not a new problem. Men have never been equal. It is something inherent to men to underestimate the others. There have always been some who ordered and some who obeyed and as this system works perfectly. Why are we going to change it?
But even if some people like the society we live in, the number of people who wants to find a new system where everybody could be equal is increasing everyday but it is very complicated to change a way of thinking that has always triumphed and even so I know some day all men will be equal. I hope it will be soon.

The Army is a hierarchical organization of armed men with the capacity of holding a invader, leading the war on the outside of their countries and maintaining the order inside. Over the centuries, the importance and the structure of the Army have reflected the geographical position, wealth and the technical development of the nations.
Nowadays, borders has been set and countries have entered in a dynamic of economic unity, leaving all the armies in a second place. Therefore, the number of their members, their usefulness and the development of their duties have been changing in order to comply with the new neccesities.
Armament has been developed enormously and the military tactics have changed. Moreover, fortunately wars among nations have been conspicuous by their absence, and these countries even have joined their forces by creating great military groups, like the `Blue Helmets', in order to defend common interests.
So there is no sense in the idea of a large army due to the lack of utility. Specialization and reduction of soldiers have been made necessary. Governments are tending to form professional armies.
U.S.A. was one of the first pioneers in this objective, and has demonstrated, like in the Gulf War, that the most important things to win are to dispose of the most advanced armament and highly qualified soldiers.
In 1973 the american army carried forward a change in its system of military service. Firstly it would be replaced it by a selective service - professions considered the most useful to the society, the most qualified students... were excused from doing the military service. Later, a system of volunteers was established. This also has worked in G.B. and Canada alike.
Spain and France tender, although in a slow way, to the creation of this system. At the moment they follow a mixed system of compulsory and voluntary recruitment.
I consider the disappear of the compulsory military service the only way to bring about a professional army. Not only does today`s youth lose a school or labour year in the complete development of their economic future, but quarters are also a waste of money, since soldiers do not make anything productive.
The Army does not have enough economic resources in order to give a satisfactory military education and training for so many people. Furthermore, the majority of soldiers have no interest in becoming a good soldier. They are only there because it is an obligation.
In conclusion, a professional army is worth the trouble, since it is formed by soldiers full of excitement and eagerness that know what they want and what they are doing.
This also could be considered as another employment proposal for young people. The Army gives them the opportunity to study and learn a job. Then they finish their training, they are ready to vork in the Army and earn good wages.
In this way, the Army increases in quality. It will be able to demand it results.

Just a few words before...
When we speak about feminism we always get very different opinions, even among those who call themselves feminists. Some of these opinions can sometimes be controversial. Considering myself a non- archetypal feminist, my own opinions could happen to be a bit contradictory sometimes.
The examples I'll mention in this essay will be mainly referred to feminism in Spain and England, as I have more points of reference with regard to this two countries.
Talkinq about feminism.
One of the most important protest campaigns in Britain was the Suffragette Movement. At the beginning of this century women couldn't vote in British elections. The Suffragettes wanted to change this. We will never know how successful the Suffragettes were, because in 1914 the First World War started and the protests were stopped. During the war many men's jobs were done by women, because men were in the army. The war changed people's ideas about many things. When it ended in 1918 the vote was given to all men over twenty - one and to women over the age of thirty. A few years later it was given to all adults over the age of twenty-one.
There has been similar movements in other countries and women have been, little by little, gaining ground. But it's still true in some places that women have to carry on jobs which, historically, have always been asigned to males, like farming, working in the fields, etc, and have, at the same time, to do the housework, taking care of the kids, etc.
It's not only in the country that women have to develop these multiple roles. An average family nowadays consists on a ""he"", who, whether has or doesn't have a job, uses to let all the housework be done by ""her"", and occasionally gives a hand in enough simple tasks to keep his brain safe against headaches; and a ""she', who can sometimes stupidly assure, very proudly, she is a ""superwoman"", and therefore can afford all sacrifice and work twenty five hours a day, going to work, taking care of ""he"" and the kids, and showing everybody her shiny kitchen, and taking his time as well, to do the shopping, having coffee (or whatever) with her mates, and ocasionally having time to spend with a nice lover that offers her all that necessary things (???) that ""he"" can not give her.
This examples only come to show there is still a lot of work to be done, and what real feminists should try do do first is to change female's mind, and then do the same with the male's, 'cos there's no way we could change something unfair if we, women, are not the first ones who become aware of what is fair or not, and the only way of stopping them patronizing us, either considering us as fragile china miniatures, or simple ""bimbos"" (sexual objects whith an absolute lack of brains).
And that's why, in my opinion, the first feminists did a lot of good to the cause of women, getting for us at least to be considered as people (that is, animals with a brain able to think and decide, for instance, which politician would, in our opinion, do less harm to our country).
Feminism nowadays is another story, specially when talking about Spain. Objectives are not that clear, victories are not that convincing and there are some not too obvious points, like the abortion law, even for some who consider themselves as feminists. This law was a victory of feminism in England a long time ago. In fact, if that country advantages us in something, it is in showing consideration for women and respecting and even imposing women's rights, although it's still a long way off the day we will see thousand of us elected to ministers, to Parliament and the European Parliament, the day we won't suffer any kind of discrimination.
Anyway, although I don't think feminists are doing any harm to the cause of women, I do believe the kind of propaganda some feminist groups of them use to display is not effective at all. Each womann has to realise she can fight her particular battle on her own, not showing everybody how week they are and joining groups to get stronger.

SPM02013,2.0,3.0,,,,,"In his novel ""Animal Farm"" George Orwell wrote ""All men are equal but some are more equal than others"". How true is this today?","
When I readed ""Animal Farm"" a few years ago, I was moved by this sentence precisely: ""All men are equal: but some are more equal than others"". And nowadays, I think it's still totally true.
There are a lot of situations to which we can apply this assertion.
Let's think about some of them.
Let's think sbout the suffering of people in the 3rd world. They don't have covered even the most basic necessity: The food.
They are dying for starvation or lack of medicines while we consume and spend our money in superfluous things. They are dying while the ""1st world"" throw out their surplus to prevent the coming down of the prices and therefore to maintain their economy.
Why do we think that they are not equal to us?.
Let's think about the thousands of children who have to work in order to support their families: The little miners of Colombia, the children who work more than ten hours a day making carpets or crystal bracelets in India, the children who pick up saffron with their little hands during the night .
They haven't access to the education, and probably most of them will dye before they were 15 or 16, while the children of the manager who bought them, go to the university in Europe.
Why do we think that they are not equal to our children?.
Let's think also about the different races in the world.
People who were not white have been discriminated through the history: Black people, Indians, half-breed people, Orientals, Arabs, Gypsies etc,. And nowadays this discrimination is still going on.
Why do they have to live in ""guetos""?
Why don't they have access to the education in many cases?
We don't want them when they como to our countries running away from horrible situations, and we think they all are delinquents or criminals.
Why do we think that they are not equal to us?.
But we can find more of these examples nearer to us: 	Let's think about the homosexuals or lesbians. People who have to hide themselves because we think that we have the right to judge them.
We deny them the opportunity of being married or of having children. We despise and insult them.
Why do we think that they are not equal to us?
Let's think sbout the girls who are not considered like their brothers in many homes and about the women: workers, mothers and housewives who are the actual supporters of their families.
Women who have got their access to the working world, have to work out and inside their homes.
Many of these women who are prepared to hold responsibility posts, are beibg limited because of they are women.
There are women who are considered only as objects, who are violated and who are phisically and mentally ill-treated by their husbands in many cases.
Why do they think thsa we are not equal to them?.
The list would be neverending: Old people, drug adicts, people affected by AIDS, mentally or phisically handicapped people, homeless etc,.
People who are not considered as equal.
So, unfortunately, nowadays, George Orwell's sentence is probably truer than never. 	However, we have to hold the hope and to educate our children in the tolerance, in order to they can live in a better world in the future.

SPM02015,2.5,2.0,,,,,The prison system is outdated. No civilized society should punish its criminals: it should rehabilitate them,"
It's obvious that the governments of all the countries in the world have to defend people from all those those things that endanger not only their lives but also their possessions.
All through the history of mankind there have been several ways of punishing murderers and thieves, depending on the different cultures, races and religions of that specific group of people. But I am not going to talk about the past. What I am going to talk about is the fact that today, at the door of the 21st century, men haven't been able to find a humane way of solving this problem.
Nowadays, when a person is found guilty of murder or robbery, three things may happen to him/her: 	-be released from prison by paying bail.
-be sent to prison for a shorter or longer time.
-be killed (death penalty).
Of course, the third possibility is the least frequent, but it is sometimes carried out (more in some countries than in others) and, in my opinion, it shouldn't. It would be extremely risky to put someone to death because we can never be sure whether a person is completely guilty of a crime. I'd think of life inprisonment as a last resort, but trying to rehabilitate the criminal, not abandoning him/her in a locked room.
I read somewhere, I don't remember in which newspaper or book exactly, that some of the murderers who are killed on the electric chair in the U.S.A. are mentally ill. I prefer not to investigate whether it is true. I would get depressed.
We must neither punish murderers nor send them to prison. We are all responsible for the existence of crimes and robberies in the world and we are the only ones who have the power to turn murderers in human beings. If they kill because they are crazy, we will take them to a hospital to take care of them, not to the electric chair. If they kill because of political reasons, jealousy, longings for power of money, etc... we will have to rehabilitate them, not to punish them. Death penalty and life inprisonment will never reduce the number of crimes (I even think that the number would increase).
The only problem is that this way of dealing with criminals requires a lot of money and a big effort on the part of the society, but I think that both the expenses and the effort would be worth.
Apart from all this, I'd like to add that the current prison system we have in Spain makes rich people not to spend more than three nights in prison. They are usually released in a few days by paying bail. Let's remember how many days Mariano Rubio spent in prison.
Therefore, the society is letting people with a lot of economic power take advantage of a system that perhaps was created by themselves, and this means that the society is controlled by them, because unfortunately, the ones who have the money are the same as the ones who have the social, political and ideological power over the entire society.
In short, the current prison system is not only OUTDATED but also completely UNFAIR.
A fair distribution of goods and a higher level of civic education will undoubtedly make a much better world.

SPM03002,4.0,3.0,,,,,"Some people say that in our modern world, dominated by science and technology and industrialisation, there is no longer a place for dreaming and imagination. What is your opinion?","
Science, technology and industrialisation have contributed in the killing of dreams and imagination but not as much as the limited vision of what life is. If the meaning of what life isn't had been defined, awareness of this killing of dreams and imagination would be clearer. Life is not only work or study, relax or weekend; it is nor seating in front of the T.V. while our time goes without or knowledge neither of the reaching of a goal with the object of a good economical income.
The presence of a goal in life does not justife the lack of dreaming about other things that are not related with that goal. Sometimes goals become so selfish that its narrowness destroys dreams without which there is no imagination. If those small, selfish goals happen to be fulfil during the life time, then what. At this point dreams die and conformism take control over every one's life. But if those small goals go accompanied by a hard desire of helping others to develop and to reach a consciousness of being persons, our dreams will endure for us and for many others later on times. In order to bring into life these eternal dreams, men's imagination has worked all throughout History.
Our parents and before them our grandparents got the desire of create a better world for future generations. Their goals were a most peaceful land and a more confortable one, so many of the suffering they went through others would not have to past. Unfortunately the dream of peace is not real yet, but we are still working in it with a vision of future too. They had advanced a lot in their other goal, and even with all those advances they weren't gotten stuck; they had always something in mind to converge on their purpose. In the tools they used to fulfil those dreams, the most outstanding were imagination and science. These together produced technology which has had two different places of being developed, industry or work and home.
Industrialisation took away those jobs that noboby wanted as working with poison gasses in the factories. It also simplified tasks that were extremely complicated to to, a census for instance, or offices files or similars, that have been replace by wonderful computers. Industrialisation brought with it mass production. Mass production has reduced the costs of clothes, books, fodd and many other kind of things; this reduction made things accessible to everyone, providing a higher stage in life.
The other environment in which technology has been introduced is at home. It is obvious that our homes are seeter than our grandmams' ones because thechnology. Think about how would be your house without the last century's inventions. Who is going clean the carpet, wash the thousand clothes every person in the family has in their closets or cut the loan? (If you have one).
The benefits of this introduction of technology in both, work and home, are free time and, as noted before, a higher stage in life. Free time that is used in family, with friend, time for hobbies too; time to live and enjoy life. Time for dreaming dreams in which imagination will create a new, different world for our kids. A higher stage, not only because comfort, but also because a larger education, gives us different options about how to spent life, options that our parents couldn't choose.
Finally, a conclusion can be drawn up enphasizing our first statement, that is: technology, science and industrialisation have not killed dreams and imagination. They were tools by which men have transformed dreams in every day's life. Dreams creates technology through science and imagination. This new technology opens the door for new dreams with the desire of increasing that technology in order to create another new one using the same toolsn (science and imagination) plus old technology. So, nor dreams neither imagination have die. If somebody thinks that way, the only thing that person has to do is to remove the conformism from its mind and to allow dreams flow free into it.

SPM03003,3.0,3.0,,,,,"In the words of the old song: ""Money is the root of all evil""","
In every period of time money has been the main reason of many mischiefs due to its meaning in life. First of all, money means wealth, and this means happyness in our culture though it si not true.So that, an evil of our society is that people focus their lives around money, they work as hard as they can, look for several jobs, work all day, and every member of the family to get as much money as they can. One of the results of all this is the competitivity within the jobs in order to be promoted to a higher rank withou caring too much of people they step by. Another consequence is the loss of contact within the family because there are different schedules and they can not see each other very much. Even nowadays, we are arriving to a loss of the family value; married couples do not want to have mor than one or two children because it needs a bigger amount of money and a time to them, for the reason that, they will have to dedicate a part of the time they spend in their jobs. Also related to families, there are a lot of destroyed families because of inheritance o quarrels about money.
Therefore money is below everything, another evil in our society is the theme of drugs. All the market of drugs is due to the fact of getting money, as they are fobidden are more expensive and so selling them have became a prosper business in which you can get a big amount of money, ""easily"". The consumption fo drugs is needed once you are adicted to them, and that is what drug sellers look for to get fixed customers without worrying about the destruction of lives that drug brings.
On the other way round what money cause directly, another evil, are robberies just to get more money or goods other people have and we have not. This something that always has existed since the fist cultures to our days and it will happen for ever.
However we can not forget about politics and all the evil money has produced in it, due to the ambition of power politics corructed. Countries have been governed by means of money, for example money has caused most of the wars. As the Golf War in wihich the USA declared the war to Sadam Hussein because of the petroleum, a sinonym of great amounts of money and which is in hands of arab countries. Not only USA were involved in this war but also many countries support one side or another deppending on their interests. Or even Bosnia War, in which it seems it was a matter of different cultures, races and identities, it is also present the money because the countires which are around them are not very interested in the end of the war because they can sel them weapons.

SPM03004,3.0,2.5,,,,,All armies should consist entirely of professional soldiers: there is no value in a system of military service,"
All countries in the world should have armies, but if there is no help for it, they must be professional.
The question I have allways made myself is : what we want armies for?. The answer seems obvious: to defense ourselves in the event of war. But if we analyze the problem, we see two different opinions: the states wich hold an army because reasons of defense and the troubled regions (with border problems, for example) which use their arms to attack.
If we found some way to avoid the trade of arms, the armies wouldn't have any sense because they would not obbey their objectives of defense and attack; it happens that the countries which meke the weapons are the great powers like USA, England, Germany, Austria... and other ""non conflict"" nations, that have the army to defense themselves. They could stop manofacture them so there would not be trade and the weapons would not be sold to the countries involved in belics conficts. And without arms, there would not be armies, but of course, the trade of arms just like the wars are a business so, it is practically imposible to stop the production of amrs.
The church thinks this way also, it does not give any justification to the wars (they are sin), and they should be resolved by dialogue.
Against these opinions about not having armies, there are another ones which are in favour of them, and in this case, I think they ought to be professionals.
In my opinion it is very logic the idea of having voluntary soldiers in the army since a citizen can have a lot of reaons for not wanting to carry a gun in his hands. These reasons are ethical/religious, political ideas (the supporters of a movement for independence who do not want to serve one's country) or simply economical reasons, like loosing one man's job to go to the military service.
These people who do not want to soldier have nowadays two situations in some countries (including Spain): the ones who are called conscientions objetors that serve one's country by making the social security benefit (P.S.S. in Spain), or the ones who declare oneselves: ""unsubmissive"" because they think that the social security benefit is a punishment or something inside the military system.
It seems that the foot-citizen believes each day less in the army (Spain has the highest number of conscientions objectors in the C.E.E.); so if there is an army it might be professional, and formeb by people who believe in that and want to dedicate their lives to it.
And now that it seems like having a solution, the question is: why do no have all countries a professional army?. They main reason is that there should be necessary a lot of money to mantein it, and not all nations can afford it. I add another great objection and it is that the soldiers become inhumans like machines to kill without feeling.
I think that nobody can oblige citizens to participate in wars that they do not understand or simply they do not interest its purporses.
In my opinion it is unfair that innocent people suffer the misfortunes of a war. If two governers of different countries want to dispute something like a part of a land, they should solve the problem themselves without involving the rest of the population.
I think that wars are ridiculous, and therefor, arms and armies are absurd too.

SPM03007,3.0,,,,,,"Some people say that in our modern world, dominated by science and technology and industrialisation, there is no longer a place for dreaming and imagination. What is your opinion?","
In the world, dominated by science, technology and industrialisation, there is no a place for dreaming and imagination. Thanks to science and its consecuences, technology and industrialisation, appeared the big factories and the capitalism system; the people began to work as much and fastly as possible, in a mechanical way, in order to get money to live. They began to live for working and to work for living. So the dreams and imagination only might appear in the spare time.
Not only, in the modern life, there is not too much spare time for imagination and dreams but the technology have replaced it too. The technological progress is so important that is always present in the daily life in comparison with preceding ages.
In preceding ages the people used their imagination in order to survive in a handy manner, exploring their creativity and exploring the limits of their minds. With very few advances it was possible to live in a pleasantly and quiet way, using the nature and the imagination, the creativity and ability of manking. Besides the families used to converse about their daily activities, or the grandparents to tell stories or tales to their grandchildren near the chimney developing the imagination and sharing their dreams.
Nobody exercises his imagination in the present times. The technological progress makes all so easy and the human being is so tired because of the hard job, that nobody writes, paints, composes music unless as a profession and usually then they make use of computers to make it easier and faster job or follow a fashion to get money forgetting the imagination, the dreams, the art.
The lack of imagination affects the children too. We trasmits them our way of enjoying and living. It is not strange for us the scene of a family dining watching TV and without speaking. They will not develop the imagination if only watch TV, play with the computer and not read or listen stories from their elders or play with other children. The technology produces not only a lack of imagination, dreams and creativity but isolation or lost of relationships, a lonely child watching TV instead playing with another child, as a consequence, human conflicts because of speaking while someone is watching TV or, moreover, the zapping.
The virtual reality may suppose the useless of imagination for following generations. The great and continuous avances in this field of investigation may become true a way of living that only seemed possible in novels and films, in the imagination that the human being pleasantly used to exercise. Besides the evolution towards a more technological world may become a more passive mankind. With the getting of a computer programme and the specific equipment the people could feel as reality dreams that before only could be true in their minds. It would be possible to feel all sensations of the world as reality only using a computer.
Nobody at this moment can forsee all that the virtual reality could suppose for the future of mankind but it is likely that it may be a confusing anb chaotic world without limits between fiction and reality and never more the mankind would use imagination and dreams.

SPM03008,3.5,3.0,,,,,"Some people say that in our modern world, dominated by science and technology and industrialisation, there is no longer a place for dreaming and imagination. What is your opinion?","
The twentieth century is the century of science, technology and industrialization. In this century a great number of very relevant discoveries have taken place. Most of them have changed our way of living and have influenced our way of looking at the world.
One of the most decisive inventions has been television which has made our life completely different from its appearance. Although this change began with the invention of the radio, the one that substituted the enjoyment of the company of friends and family has been television.
This fact together with the development of cinema have destroyed nearly the act of imagining and reading. Reading used to be an usual activity of entertainment but has been mostly replaced by watching television or seeing a film. Nowadays everybody should find reading interesting and enjoyable, however, the reality is totally different. As an example of this we can see how most of the students of secondary school in Spain do not like to read, and if they do it, it is only because they have been obligued at school. It is very well known that when a book is read the imagination has to work actively and the mind of the person who is reading the book can origine a wide range of sensations. On the contrary, when someone is seeing a film or watching a television program everything is already done and the feelings that emerge from the brain of the spectator are those that the filmaker wants to make appear in his mind.
Moreover the birth of computers has meant a revolution in every field of modern life. Everything is easier, and so easy that children do not need to imagine new worlds or different games because the electronic games do almost everything. Some years ago a child could imagine that he was a great king with lot of power and a big castle just with a couple of wooden pieces, or a little girl could imagine that she was a beautiful princess with only a cloth over her head. Today all these things have practically chaged, most of the children are used to play with their electronic games and their toys are so complicated and perfect that they do not need fantasy at all.
As I have said before this is the century of science. But some sciences have been developed not only during this century but some centuries ago. Such sciences as Medicine, Biology, Chemistry, Astronomy and the discoveries made by them have thrown away a great number of theories that had had the purpose of giving an explanation to some phenomena that apparently had not a logical reason. These theories were studied, and are still studied but with less success by some pseudosciences like Palmistry, Astrology, Occultism, Parapsychology, Spiritualism, Hypnosis, etc., but most of the times these theories were exposed and created by the popular tradition and superstition in which the imagination played a very important role.
To finish with this topic I would like to make a vindication of the importance of literature against the great influence that modern sciences and empirical sciences have in the actual world. Literature always gives an opportunity to the development of imagination and selfcreation, while technology, science and industrialisation condemn the world of imagination and fantasy nearly to the desaparition.

SPM03009,3.0,2.0,,,,,"Some people say that in our modern world, dominated by science and technology and industrialisation, there is no longer a place for dreaming and imagination. What is your opinion?","
Imagination and dreaming have had, and will always have, a very important role inside society, both inside this modern society and inside whatever exists - a past or a future society-.
But answering to those people who think this society is dominated by science technology and industrialization, we will see their opinion under another point ov view: where more imagination is needed than in creating those devices that human being has made, not only in our modern society but through the whole history? We are referring to that imagination is present in the technology itself.
Though technology and industrialization have a more complex definition, they are something like the vanguard, like the most advanced discoveries in the field of sciences. But behind of all the science world's complexity, we found the figure of the inventor.
With an historical point of view, inventors- both modern and ancient one- have always needed some kind of fancy, some dreams which could be realized.
The fact is that an invention can be defined like ""the material realization of an inventor's dream"". So we can deduce that the inventions have a great part of imagination and dreams, even in the most modern one. For example, Mini Compact Disk join usefulness and ""dreams""; to condense the typical 12'7 inches vinilium record in a handable 2'5 inches plastic one, but with more utilities than anyone could have thought thirty years before; storing not only music but animated images with a high quality, computer information with an amazing speed of resolution, and many others utilities.
That fancy has existed in ancient inventors as well, though its figure have changed with the past of the time: the inventor is no longer a bohemian personage with long white beard, locked in his laboratory, but in many cases they are teams of people who belong to great multinational companies - as in the example of the CD whose invention was developed by Philips company -, or belong to universities, where a lot f investigations are carried out; for example the University of Pensilvania developed the electronic calculator nearly 50 years ago.
There are people who think that technology and this society are guiding us towards another one more mechanized, more automatized in the sense that all our acts will be ruled and controlled by machines, however the human ability of imagination is an inexhaustible resource of dreams, illusions, and hopes which will always be present in any person's mind whatever his society be.
But the fact is that the imagination, the fantasy, what surprise us, is present in the whole humanity as well as inside technology and invention when they create amazing advances and that they never stop surprising us.

SPM03012,3.0,2.0,,,,,Most university degrees are theoretical and do not prepare students for the real world. They are therefore of very little value,"
Years back going to University was something that not many people could afford. Therefore only wealthy families could pay for their children's education. The main problem was not only the expenses of university but, that while people were sduding could not work and earn money so they were not productive for their families, that depended on that income to survive. That is why the majority of people left school when they were still very young, having learnt the very basic things. From school they went straight to work, but they did not do anything in relation with that they studied. As that was very little, or in some cases nothing at all, they were obliged to do manual work. Some of them managed to get a job as an apprentice of some sort and that way they learnt a trade. While others looked after animals, worked the land and so on.
This semi-skilled or unskilled working class wanted something better for their children, wanted them to have an education and go to university and become doctors lawyers, etc. As the economical situation has changed, they have been able to send them there. So nowadays most of the youngsters that belong to those social clases go to university, most of them, because they do not want to do manual works like their parents do. This is one of the reasons why universities are so crowded.
As so many people go to university, teaching becomes a difficult task. The number of students per class is quite large, that is why professors are very limited, and classes are more theoretical than practical. Only a few degress have practical classes and those happen to be all science, such as medicine, chemistry, biology and so on. In any case the practice is not enough but at least they have something. Most university degrees have not practical classes at all. Even though that is neither the proffessors' fault nor the students, they all suffer the consequences. One of the consequences is that students only rely on exams to get the degree, and most times this is not fair because they are not able to prove what they can do but how good their memory is. The most important consequence is to face the problems they have, once they leave university. One of them is to find a job, but that is nothing to do with education, it is a social and economical matter. The second and greatest problem is to perform what they have learnt. Because they did not have practical classes they do not have any experience therefore they do not know what to do with what they have studied. This leads to an important question in the student's mind. Is is really worth to spend five years of one's life studying for nothing?. This, and other questions do not have a clear answer.
Although they have no answers to many of the questions that go through their minds, they have no many other choices. On one hand if they do not study, the posibility of working is almost nonexistent. But no the other hand if they obtain their degree, it is of a very little value, as all they know is theory and they do not have any practical experience.
Thus, the only thing these students can do is to fight in order to make the government invest more money in education so that they could have more practice in their degrees.

SPM03013,3.0,2.0,,,,,All armies should consist entirely of professional soldiers: there is no value in a system of military service,"
One of the topics that people, especially young people, argue in daily conversations, is the idea of doing the Compulsory Military Service. The most of the people avoid it as if it was a terrible disease and try in, all the ways, not to do it.
However, people are concerned that someone has to protect us in case of an armed fight, but they think it would be better for all, the creation or a profesional army. In that way there would be a group of cualified persons capable to do all kind of jobs related with the protection of the citizens as soon as the realization of other kind of work.
The complicacies that Military Service establish to youth are connected, in a large number of cases, with the incompatibility of study and do the Military Service. In the most of the cases, it can be avoid with the solicitation of an extension of several years to do what the young man is doing in that moment so as not to interrupt the educational process of the person.
But that do not always happens and some persons have to do it and they can do anything in the matter without it makes big problems to them. There are two kind of people that refuse to do Military Service: the two groups have in common the idea of not war and no arms or simply that they do not want to use arms against other people, but there are some differences between them and while ones, instead of doing Military Service, perform some others communitary activities as help in hospitals or aid faulty children, the second ones fight the system as they can but that way of act can generate all kind of problems for them, even the imprisonment.
Besides the social conflicts that the Compulsory Military Service produce, there are some other topics that make it more problematic. The cuantity of money invest in equipment, armament, supplies and in appointments is bigger than the money which would be spent in a profesional army. Some countries as Denmark or Switzwerland, have abolish the Compulsory Military Service and creating a profesional army saving millions of dollars in that way.
Finally, the idea of a system bases in the Military Service seems to be made with the only purpose of annoy young people when the creation of a profesional army looks like the best way to defend our country and they way of create more employment at the same time that please all us.

All evils have their roots in money as we all know. The rich people and the poor one always been all around the world. Both kinds of people have been submitted to money for many reasons. These reasons can be divided in two pieces:- one: causes which concern the poors and, the ones that have to do with rich people would be the second one.
As regards the latter, most of the rich people belong jewels, cars, mansions,... However, these properties don't seem to be enough for them. They usually become more and more selfish. This selfishness attracts many evils. One of them is corruption. Nowadays, it is seem as the spot of the light of Spanish politics. Though it doesn't mean that it has not been present before, because it has always been hidden. Corruption in all its aspects (politic, economic,...) goes very close to bribes. They appear in all the subjects you can imagine. If we think about the media there are lot of bribes, above all, in T.V. Also many of them stikes the world of the sport: referees in matches of football for example, or other games. But even in the most serious fields, one of them Law, is where they occur more frequently. Moreover, we now and then are found with dealings with drugs involving corruption and bribes. That originates frequently misunderstandings because lower social classes are, or were thought to be de traders, whereas all the money and therefore drugs comes from highest soccial ones. Swindle is another example of ordinary evil in these days regarding money, obviously. Selfishness is, as I've said in previous lines, the greatest evil of our society. As regards developed and rich countries, their selfishness and high proud bring the poverty to other ones and consequently we find the third world.
On the other hand, when poverty reigns in your life, the normal that can happen is that you beg, as many people do in the streets, in the underground and places like that. But this seems to become harder when you hear about murders among beggars, or robberies in stores, banks..., pick-pockets and so on. Prostitution is another solution that poors accept as a way of surviving, above all women, and this fact is very sad but the worst of the levels is that of commiting suicide. With this idea we reach to the conclusion that a chaos is continually dominating our world though there are times it is hidden.
What is clear is that without money you are nothing, currently. All our world live with the obssession of that idea and it is proved in many cases it is not what produces happiness. Nevertheless, unfortunately it is a cruel reality that if you don't have money in this society you are treated like a puppet. Once again money is a point of conflict that has reigned in the mankind all around the years and, as the topic of this essay says, it is the root of all evils that occur in our society.

Science technology and industrialisation are dominating our modern world, but dreaming and imagination have as well place in our life.
The scientific developments which have been carried out during the last decades have made life much easier and comfortable to live. The efect of industrialisation have produced a lot of advantages with respect to the quality and safety of the human's life. One of the main advantages that technology offers us is that almost everything is made by machines facilitating the man's work.
But, what about the disadvantages of modern world?
In this world almost ruled by computers, full of hate, bigotry, and selfishness, where the best is supposed to be the one who owns most, there is a space for dreaming and imagination. We can not limit our life making use of what modern civilization is offering us, material things which have already been created and that do not let us contribute in personal way.
We should stimulate ourselves by doing something new, something which adduce us a development as human beings, creating and making true our dearest dreams.
Human nature feels the necessity of escaping from the real life. If we are capable of fergeting about the reality which is surrounding us, we could fly to another worlds which could offer us satisfactions without material things.
But sometimes is difficult to cast aside the mask of civilization because it dominates our daily life.
However, there are many people who live apart from development because they live in small towns quite far from big cities. The fact is that the habitants of these country towns do not make use of most of the advantages of technology and hence their lifes are obviously a more natural and single lifes.
Industrialisation brings itself a lack of spiritual things which are important for mankind. By means of dreaming and imagination we can make a much more pleasant life.
We do not have to follow what the rest of the world tries to inculcate us accepting an artificial and superficial way of life. We should follow our heart dictates and let our minds free for a while for reflexion.
In our daily life we often suffer the weight of the increasing worries provocated by living in a modern world, where everything is done as a competition. This fact can be translated into some serious problems as for instance, falling into depression which mostly is a consequence of a nervous strain famously known as the stress of modern life.
As far as I'm concerned, I agree with what Mary Shelley says in her masterpiece ""Frankenstein, or the Modern Prometheus"", giving importance to imagination. Life for me is chaos and according to Shelley's opinion, ""invention does not consist in creating out of void, but out of chaos"", and that is the esence of imagination.
When something troubles me I use to let fly my dreams in attent to ease myself. But as everything done is excess, we can not afford to escape too much from reality and in spite of being good to potenciate our imagination, we must have the feet on the ground.
Imagination and dreaming have much to do with creation. Most of artists like painters or writers have created their main works with the desire of reaching another places, situations or feelings which real life itself could not bring them. Their best masterpieces shows us a proof of the influence of their worries but also the need of avoiding the reality as an evasion.
As conclusion, I would assert that in life we have a wide fan of possibilities of escaping from science technology and industrialisation, and if we are wise we can perfectly separate these chaotic world from a more spiritual and profit way of life. 	Dreams and imagination are our most powerful weapons to live in perfect armony and happiness.
So let's keep on dreaming because only man and no machines are able to do it.

Nowadays we live in a society where the empirical and realstic thoughts and facts are the only valid. Nowadays we live in a cement world where those who live in their own crystal world are considered to be crazy. A functional and practial world where a dream, an instant of imagination is unuseful if you are not n artist and you shape it into a work such as a novel or a picture.
The English writer Robert Herrick`s poem ""Dreams"" sys, ""Here we are all, by day; by night, we`re hurled/ By dreams each one ito a severalworld"" and show us the most outstanding, and odvious, value of dreaming and imagination: their importance in each erson`s own role; not as any other charasteristic, but as one of the most determinative factors of each one`s personality. Our different dreams, illusions, and reative imagination make us be different eole ... they underlie our individuality ... they put a stroke of colous in the grey and routine every day activity. In a time when everything is said to be imposed, when everybody is said to be equal dreaming and imagination are a claim for individuality; i a time when one does not agree with the situation or is simply tired of it, it is logical to dream and to imagine ... it is normal to practice one of the few activities you can do without any snags, in a personal and incontrollable space.
In line with the previously saiod, it could e said that the actiity of dreaming is healthy for the ""spirit"". Freudian philosophy unforlded the idea that night-dreaming a way of calming our frustrations and a way of expressig the hope for all our objecties and illusions, as satisfactory as night-deaming ...? When ""thinking is doubting"", as Unamuno (the Spanish existentialist writer) said, why not dreaming?
When people lose their little illusions and dreams, they lose their interest in life in a big scale and get tired and depressed. Chinese philosophy has also its opinion about this matter when Li-Tao-Po explains that life is full of small nice things and that the art consists in being able to find and appreciate them. These samll things, these small dreams have to be a constant in our lives, we have to set up aims and goals that motivate us to obtain them; although we usually are not able to get them, the most impostant is the motivation they cause in our ""psyche"". Thus, in a certai way, God is a dream a hope, because we (believers or not) do not know if he exists or not, one can possibly feel him, or not ... it is the same case as a dream we do not know if we will be able to get ... but, anyway, God, as a big hoe, motivates a lot of people.
So, these little dreams can grow into bigger and bigger dreams, illusions and ideals, and a few of them pass from the personal to the social sphere. Martin Luther King, L. Da Vinci, Coleridge ... among other philosophers, scientists and writers, are known to have had a dream, to be dreamers and get important thigs thanks to their imagination, illusions and dreaming. So, if this world were perfect it would not be necessary to have to power of imagination, but as it is not, the faulty to reate our own combinations of real or unreal ideas has been profitable since the human being became ""sapiens"". Thus we can take advantage and enjoy the previous good people`s creative works, from arts to techniques.
Therefore the good dreams of a lot of people who shaped or worte their thoughts and illusions have also a social value known by all of us, but we do not think of the fact that these eople who wanted to improve their situation and the situation of the world were big dreamers, and at first little dreamers. So, now better than ever ... for you ... for us ... dream ...

People find their happiness in different ways. Some meet it going to different place from they usually live one. Others are happier buying an expensive car to fancy. Still others like to make presents to others for seeing how they are happy. Most people who find happiness meet it having a mint of money to not limit what they wnt to do each time.
The variety of ways to be happy in the life are nealy ever derivated from money since it is esential in many cases. Why do some persons say ""money is not happiness""? They ought to add-happiness is easier by the aid of money.
Does ""giving your money"" make sense anymore? You do not want Isabel Preisley is going to lay on heating in the palace of her dog means by your money in some degree but yor can not do it is not being so.

What can you do about it?
In order to have an important sum of money, people do barbs. Nowadays earning money is waging war. Firstly men of means scorn men without money then the last ones hate for well-off ones. At the beginning money caused a fight between men but after the bathing has increased and its spirit still animates both face up to themselves. Today it is not a fight today it is war. Otherwise you only think how earning money. Firstly you play a football pool and it may be you happiness but you are not lucky. The best thing is steady something such as a specualtion of jewels for instance, that is acquiring the jewels with certain money and after this selling it at a more expensive prize.
Bit by bit you do not know what to do for increasint this amount. It can arrive at the extent of being provide by someone with money When someone has a bit monely useually will be an ambitious person. Money always becomes little money. It starts being a big problem to try. You think the easiest approach to earn it. One comfortable way to make both meets end at home could be putting on sale different kind of drugs in suitable places for it.
When the amount of money is going to become enough high you could work with very important people. People who can help you to earn more money and so it can become your obsession.
To sum up we can say that the main purpose from men in the life is being happy mainly means by money since money helps to leve better.
Men want to earn money is the root of all evil, these are the words of the old song and of the one sad reality.

Science technology and industrialisation determine to a great extent the basis of modern world cuture. Thios is the reason why our life is so mechanical and automated and, becuse of this, we are not used to dreaming and letting our imagination play a role in our lives.
The advances of technology are visible in all aspects of our daily life and nowadays it is very difficult to live without these advances, although in many cases it would be suitable to do without them.
Technology in general, is developed and expanded quickly and it has shown numerous and advantageous advances in th world of industrialisation. There is a clear example, this is the invention of the computer, which consists of an electronic machine that can quickly make calculations, store, rearrange, and retrieve information, or control another machine. The use of computers makes the industrial, comercial and administrative activities easier and more comfortable, but it also prevents us from thinking.
As technology gives us the solutions for so many problems we hardly use our capacity to think and develop our imagination. Because of this, our life is, in this sense, automated and mechanical.
The remarkable advances in technology and industrialisation offers us, on the other hand, a lot of activities for our spare time and these activities do not let us use our imagination. One of the examples that makes this point is related to children`s toys, because nowadays children play with technological toys (i.e.: video games), and these toys do not let the children develop their imagination and, in many cases, they are so inactive that playing with these toys does not permit physical exercise. For example, some years ago, children used simple bicycles, but now they use ""bicycles with motor"", and one of the negative consequences of this is that children do not develop their legs. And much more similar examples could be mentioned.
In general, children like these toys but theyneed to doexercise to be healthy. Besides, with these toys, children do not think as much as they should.
If this subject is viewed with pessimism, the world could become too static in the sense that all activities will be very accessible, for instance, it is possible that in the near future instead of using books looking for information in a bibliography, we only have to sit down face a computer screen and use its keys, sothat, we can get the information that we are lookig for.
The power of modern technology and industrialisation is growing progressively in our society, and it provides us with such an inactive life that we have not got time to day-dream and to meditate on ourselves, and in this way, we can become very canculating with such a programmed life. All this can make us look like programmed machines that do something determined in every moment of the day.
It must not be seen as a maddening situation, al least not yet, because man has always dreamt and used his imagination more or less to attain his purposes. Otherwise, he could feel a great emptiness inside him.

SPM03026,3.5,2.5,,,,,"Some people say that in our modern world, dominated by science and technology and industrialisation, there is no longer a place for dreaming and imagination. What is your opinion?","
There is a place for dreaming and imagination in all the domains of life.
Dreams and imagination are necessary for arts and science so if they would not exist we had not developed neither science nor technology. On my opinion they both are the base of progress because if Leonardo da Vinci, Marie Curie, Thomas Edison, among others, had not dreamt of their inventions they would not succeeded in developing them.
Moreover they had to use their imagination in order to develop them, consequently they both are linking and in this case they are very necessary.
Also not only they are necessary for the development of science and technology, but also they are the roots of arts, even there is a movement in literature called ""Surrealisme"" which takes the author's dreams in order to create a freer poetry. A new kind of poetry can be considered the lirics of the musician Prince, in the lirics of his songs he talks about love but in a different sense, applying other concepts. They are more imaginative compared to other musicians and lirics writers, besides he composes his songs faster than others without repeating rythms or melodies and so on, so in conclusion he uses a big deal of imagination and without it nothing would be the same in his music.
There are a lot of people who say that does not understand Prince music or some kinds of sculptures and paintings, perhaps if they would open their minds and let their imagination fly they could understand not only new alternatives of art but also a lot of things about life. In this sense, from my point of view, imagination is related to intelligence because most of the cleverest people have no prejudice about learning and accepting new ideas.
Imagination can make us wiser so we must use it in our every day life, from preparing the supper to deceive our wife, ""devilish"" mother-in-law, husband or boyfriend (in the case of boyfriend or husband is quite easily so a short deal of imagination is needed).
Sometimes our everyday life disappoint us so we dream of how it should be. Dreams are important, we could not live without dreaming because human being is always trying to be better than it is or having more than it has. Human beings want to be perfect, this is why in our dreams everything is perfect. We have an ideal of how ourselves must be, something which we want reach be we never do it and probably this is the reason why we are never completely happy. We feel unhappy because we do not have enough. When you are short want to be tall but once you are tall you would like to be slimer, by the time you are slim you are thinking about tinting your hair and at the same time thinking about if you should get married, for finally spend your life trying to get rid of your husband.
In one sense dreams and imagination help one another because for obtaining our dreams we need imagination. They both are the base of ambition and this is the fact that makes us improving our world beyond the industrialization and technology which we have.

SPM03028,3.0,3.0,,,,,"In his novel ""Animal Farm"" George Orwell wrote ""All men are equal but some are more equal than others"". How true is this today?","
This essay deals with the idea of explaining the sentence written by Orwell in his book Animal Farm. It says: ""All men are equal: but some are more equal than others"". Using this statement the author influenced by the situation of his time (inter-war period) wanted to satirize the political sitiation and society of eastern countries and with this quotation he resumes the principal ideas of his nove. How true is today is going to be presented through the text.
The main Orwell`s purpose was to show a relity, the fact is that in written documents (as in Declaration of the Human Rights 1789 and in other recent one) It is considered that there is no difference between nen, but this first part of the sentence is quite distant from the reality. In the second part of the statement, the author using a comparision, completes and denies the first clause. This second part can be clarified if we expose some reasons of conflicts in our societies.
Today one of the main differences between men is their economical position. The economical position reinforces the power of the ruling classes and stresses the poverty of the lower classes. People are the same but money gives the posibility of doing many things and reinforces the inequalities of the social classes but not only between social classes but countries too.
Depending on the economical power a country can be included into a group or exluded. Only a few nations (Western European counties, United States and Japan) can be considered rich ones and can have a great influence over the rest of nations that in the worst case can be presented as a Third World country and in the best case can be declared a developing nation.
Other difference is the race, placed in a first position. Racirm is considered an important conficlt in our societies. The main surces of racism are the colonization and the emigation. Colonization deals with the economical position, a rich country exploits other one with a less developed economy. In the case of emigration, people do not stand their situation in a poor country (generally it has become poor by the influence of the colonizer) So they pove to another places. This situation creates a conflict between the emigrant and the native people of the receptive country called racism.
In a second place sex is not supposed to be a cause of discrimination today but the reality is that sexism constitutes an important reason of conflicts in our societies. Women have a traditional role in our cultures imposed by men who want to conserve their priviledges above women so it is very difficult to get cut of this traditional role but there are groups as Women`s Lib that tries to liberate women from domestic duties and from a subordinate role in society and bussines and tries to obtain a position of legal and social equality with men.
In a third position religion represents another reason of distinction, Some communities have suffered fro a long time an unfair treatement. Prejudices and misconceptions about some religious and its habits have been the main source of troubles thorough the history, an example of this can be shown if we talk about Jews.
Of people notice that all these facts are real problems in societies of the whole planet, Orwell`s statement can be considered as an important proof of the real situation between men.

SPM03029,3.0,,,,,,"Some people say that in our modern world, dominated by science and technology and industrialisation, there is no longer a place for dreaming and imagination. What is your opinion?","
Modern society does not worry any longer for dreaming and imagination. At present modern society`s way of life does not leave any free time for activities such as : imagination and dreaming. For instance if we consider a typical citizen daily life we see that it just includes workig, fast food and not really more than that. Therefore we can suspect that their main preocupations are simply money and power. However the situation changes when we look back in previous generations, even if the problem of money was the same or even greater it must be considered more as a case of necessity. The urge for material goods was not felt the same. Before it was more the expectation of buying something than the thing itself. It could represent a long time if not the rest of their lifes to get the money the object costed. Nowadays the feeling of expectation and hope have disappeared, for example if we want something, we go and buy it, and if we do not have money right at that moment we can buy it on hire purchase or we can use our credit cards.
We maybe wondering why modern society does not worry any longer for dreaming and imagination. There are two main reasons which are science technology and industrialisation. The former implies most of all free time which we are supposed to employ in ourselves. However we do not really know what to do in our spare tiem, we just watch television instead or reading a good book, which could encourage us to dream and imagine. The latter, industrialisation, can be thought as a counterpoint of the previous one. It does not leave us any free time. At present jobs require constant attention and demand a lot of responsability from us. Therefore we have no leisure time for us. For instance when we arrive home we have still some unfinished work to do.These two reasongs carry some consequences such as no newborns and some famous illness: depressions or nervous breakdowns. As we live in a material world, we want to have everything including, of course, cars, more than one house, vacations etc. That is why women have decided to work as well, leaving no time for her to give birth to babies. The above mentioned responsability causes depressions and nervous breakdowns due to the following problems: taxes, children, our jobs and the most modern of all the fear of loosing our jobs, too many difficulties to be supported by a person.
However not all are disadvantages. We have improved medicine. Some investigations are being made and some vaccines have been discovered.
As a conclusion we could say that after having analysed the two main reasons why imagination and dreaming are no longer used, we could sum them up by saying that it is time the principla cause. Therefore if we have the answer we should find a solution for having more spare time. The most known method is planning. For example, if we plan our week, we should leave one day our of seven for ourselves, we would be happier and we will have more free time for reading and for dreaming.
We must realize that imagination and dreaming are two of the most important features which differenciate as from machines and from animals.

It is said that nowadays there is no place for imagination or for dreaming in our ""supposely modern"" world but I have extremely good reasons to support it. First of all, I must explain why imagination is so important: talking about the inventions that rule our daily life which we use everytime (and we are lost if they don`t work properly), I would accept that they are very useful for us and they give us a confortable life and more spare time to spend in all what we want; but all those things are the products of the imagination of a human being or a group of brains that were thinking about a better and easier world. Those products have an imaginative beggining but now it seems that people use their imagination only for industrial purposes.
Once a professor - whose name I`ll not reveal- said that imagination sells. As we know, the most imaginative adverisment will sell better an item than a conventional one, and, that item is, as well, the result of the imagination of another person and so on. Therefore, we are in the start point again.
Let me give more examples to support my idea: when we have to work in a particular subject as a book, author or event, there is a pattern to follow but it will be funier if we make it with imagination and it will be better ""paid"".
Another proof will be the role that imagination plays in all the Arts as Literature, Music and Painting; we need imagination to write, to compose and to understand the meaing of some paintings.
Dreaming is as well in all our ordinary life. As imagination, dreaming is related to technology as the second stage of imagination: we first imagine a better world and after that we dream about how good it would be and what pleasure it would give to us and all like that. On the contrary, it is also said that dreaming too much is not good because it can be confused with reality; what a mess if we don`t know if life is real or not. Nevetheless, people who are always dreaming and living in their own world are not considered capable of developing important jobs. Because of that, dreaming is not paid very much attention but it is as important as all other industrial inventions.
To sum up, it is important to say that those two concepts are essential for our developing as human beings; so important for our developing is technology but as the previos stages of Technology, imagination and dreaming have to be considered not antique concepts but ways of improoving the utopia of a better world.

SPM03035,3.5,3.5,,,,,The prison system is outdated. No civilized society should punish its criminals: it should rehabilitate them,"
Recent researches have shown that the different aims at reforming people in the prison institutions developed between the eighteen century and the twentieth century in NorthAmerica and Europe, are obsolee.
Before the eighteen century, criminal acts were punished with physical violence including torture and mutilation or the death penalty. However since the eighteenth century some countires have seen the need to reform this system in order to carry out a juster punishment and a more human and more worthy system of execution. Besides, the proposed systems mentioned, were related to the question of the prisioner`s isolation.
The two more important systems were the Pennsylvanian system and the Auburn system. The first one, the Pennsylvanian circular system, was created in order to substitute the physical violence and death penalty for the loss of liberty, because its creator was a Quaker whose religion did not allow him to punish criminals with these types of punishment: physical violence and death penalty. This system obliged its prisioners to endure total isolation day and night in their cells during their imprisionment and forbade any type of visit, except from the prison master and the priest.
The other system, Auburn system, also obliged the prisioners to remain in their cells, but only at night in order to avoid promiscuity and corruption. Prisionersw worked with the others during the day, but in complete silence and they could not have any type of visit from their relatives.
However these two systems were soon outdated because of their consequences, though some of them are considered advantages such as avoiding the corruption and infection among the inmates, to maintain cleanliness, order and discipline. Others, on the contray, were bad for the prisioner`s health. Due to the loneliness, complete silence and physical punishment, the danger of losing psychical and physical health, hate and social maladjustment arose.
As a result of these two systems, the progressive system, which is still used, appeared. This system consisted in dividing the period in which the prisioner served his sentence in four periods of time. The prisioner started in the first period in which he did not have any priviledge. As prisioner`s behaviour improved, he was transferred from a period to another period getting priviledges, until he got the pre-liberty period, conditional liberty, when he could be released on bail. Will these four periods what was tried was to resocialize the prisioner little by little in order to adapt him to the socializing rules.
In spite of these aims at reforming prison systems over the history, none of them got its purpose of reducing deliquency and rehabilite criminals. Therefore ""sursis"" and ""provation"" were created as an alternative to the encarcelation. These two alternatives, which were developed in different countires, but mainly in England, France and Holland, prostulate respectively the suspension of execution of the punishment, according to which, the criminal is tried and condemned, but he is at liberty. If during a period of time he does not make any infraction, the punishment was considered not imposed, and the fact that after dondemning the criminal, the sentence is interrupted on dondition that the criminal accepted the ""provation"" official`s vigilance. But not even in this way, neither criminal acts have been reduced nor re-education or re-socialization of criminals in order to adopt to social rules has been achieved.
So that, at present, what different societies try to do is to prevent potential criminals from commiting criminal acts, that is to say, they try to act before people commit an offence, and not after they have commited it.

SPM03036,3.0,2.5,,,,,Most university degrees are theoretical and do not prepare students for the real world. They are therefore of very little value,"
After obtaining our university degree, we often find ourselves completely lost at our first job. This initial disorientation is caused by several factors, both external and internal, that is to say, concerning the person itself and his or her interest in getting a constant improvement.
First of all, let us consider the external factors which affects our university education.
Since the University is a system which was created in order to prepare students for a right integration in the professional world, one of its mor important objectives should be to offer a education which were complemented with an adequate professional training.
According to that proverb which says `Practice makes perfect` (in fact, the reality shows it), the inclusion of a wider period of professional training in all the univerity careers would be something necessary nowadays.
It is obvious that the biggest difficulty to get this objective is the overcrowding of our universities and, of course, the lack of economic resources. But we are considering here the reasons and the consequences. In my opinion, finding the right solution would be out of the students reach. Anyway, as an example we would say that two lawyers are better than twenty of them which would not know what to do outside the university.
There are other problems which can also affect this situation to a large extent. For instance, the time we lose all through the day because of transport or timetables, the professors subjectivity when it comes to impart their subjects - here wer are referring to the fact that several professors impart the same subject in a very different way, it affects the general education scheme created for each career-, the wrong evaluation of the students -this does not require more explanation-, and so forth.
But it is not just either attributing the blame of the degrees scarce value, only to the university system. Everybody who ""enjoy it"" should also bring their collaboration so that the degree we obtain at the end of our career were not only of theoretical value. Our best contribution would be our personal effort. Making good use of our free time, investigating every subject individually, non spending so much time chatting with our partners..., to sum up, doing everything which could contribute to get our university degree be really worthy of its name, is something we should not pass by.
The worst consequence of this lack in the university education is that all the small and big companies have already realised it. Nowadays, nobody wants iexpert lawyers. They are looking for people with professional experience, and it is getting more and more difficult for young people which have just finished their careers to get a opportunity in the professional world.
This situation will affect our society in two ways: first, the quality of the workers will be worse and, as a result of this, our economy will take a dive; second, it will be more and more impossible for young people to get a job.
Anyway, the problem we have considered clearly does not admit of an easy solution, but it is hoped that the education authority take steps to ameliorate its worst effects in a future.

SPM03037,3.5,3.0,,,,,"In the words of the old song: ""Money is the root of all evil""","
Mr. Money is the root of all kind of evil even from an assasination to a war although everyone likes to get money.
First of all, I should say that our society is divided into floors (classes), beginning with the lowest class and ending with the highest class. It is supposed that people who belong to the first one, have not much money or a lot of relationship with Mr. Money. On the contray, the highest class has very good relationship with him, but all of them would like to be very oog friends with Mr. Money, aren`t they. Why somebody would mind to gives pleasure for sometime although not for ever. After this time, when you have everything and you become rich, what happens then. Are you happier when you were rich or before then. Who don`t say that he would like to be rich but frankly, money gives us the happiness during months or years but after this time you have to realize wheter you are or not really happy.
In this world, I know that the vast majority of things are bought by money and no more, and even the friendship. There are people who have been always rich and they are only happy with money and if they were after poor, they would not be happy or vice versa. In fact, when someone has a lot of money he always wants more and more, and he is not satuated. Nowadays, we can see, for example, Javier de la Rosa or Luis Roln. In both cases, I prefer to be not very rich but happy to be rich and not very happy. Money buys happiness for sometime but not for ever.
Another point of view would be that the vast majority of the times, money carries you to the evil. Rich people when they have a lot of material things, they are satiated and they need to prove new ""things"" such a drugs or something else. Besides rich men when they have a family and, I think, that they are tired of them they look for a young pretty woman, destroying the family and besides these women are in love with the money but not with that man. Money makes handsome to men. It is not the same an attractive man in a ""seat Toledo"" car than in a ""Mercedes car"".
Those people who don`t have money and suddently, due to any circumstance of live, are rich, not ever end very well. I know a case that, on my opinion, is very good for this theme. A few years ago, a friend of mine didn`t have much money but his father`s factpru had good luck and in a few time, they have earned a lot, a lot of money. But you will say : o.k., what happens. It is very easy. He is in the theme of the drug and his girlfriend is pregnant. She is 18 years old and he is 20 years old. He didn`t have anything and suddenly, he has everything. He thought, firstly that he hadn`t enough time in his life and as he was rich, he could do everything, without any law. Now, his parents are divorced and because of the problems that they have, one of his brothers has to go to tha psychologist.
In conclusion, to have money is very good, why not, but no very much because it could carry you on until your end while money will survive and never die. The best is to be in the ""second floor"" (middle class), between rich and poor people.

SPM03042,3.0,3.0,,,,,"In the words of the old song: ""Money is the root of all evil""","
Throughout its existence, money has been extremely important for humanity and its presence has influenced largely human behaviour. The reason why it has changed so deeply men's life in all its aspects is difficult to analyze. Here, we will try to clarify the reasons which make the money the root of evil.
First of all, it is necessary this affirmation to be very clear: money is something more than a piece of paper. This is true from two points of view: 	- Money in itself could never make men happy. It is inly when man change it for material things, when he buys things, when it has its real value.
- Besides, this power of purchase is the only thing in the world that makes man feel really powerful, just like if the world was at his feet.
If we consider the human being, as it is, a mortal and insignificant creative in comparison with the inmensity of the universe, this last point can be very attractive for men. Life is short and while we are living, that life is the only one we have, so we try to make the most of it. And the easiest form of pleasure lies in material things. Money can buy everything, sometimes even health, and almost everybody. Feelings such as true love and true friendship are the only things impossible to by with money. Those who have large amounts of money live a life plenty of material things and ""friends"".
This mirage of aboundance and luxury blinds men and makes them believe that is what happiness consists in, which is a terrible mistake, that is to say, money does not mean happiness in itself, though it is as clear as daylight that it is necessary for life.
On the other hand, if we mend to remote times, before the existence of money it has always been necessary a system that made possible ""commercial relations"" among men as exchange and things so we would say that it is logic, because if it had not exist, neither then or now, something to regulate such an important aspect of the History of Humanity like economical sources are, it would have led the world to a total chaos.
But since the world has been turning men have always had an imperious need of possessing, of having more, ... So there is a very spread belief that money is mean and dirty and corrupted and things so, but this meanness is caused in a very great extent by the human beings and our innate greed. It is an outdated fact to rob and kill for money, it has been always part of man's everyday life and it has happened in all social classes. It does not matter high, middle or low classes, if someone is born or educated in bad instincts, she/he will find in money the perfect way to develop her/his wicked purposes.
If we bear in mind all we have said before, it is true that money is vital for life, but it is necessary to give it the importance it worths. We have to deal with it as an instrument, a mean to get our aims, not an aim in itself, and try to keep our integrity and values as human beings out of the reach of any material temptation.

SPM03047,3.5,,,,,,"Some people say that in our modern world, dominated by science and technology and industrialisation, there is no longer a place for dreaming and imagination. What is your opinion?","
Imagination is a keyword throughout human history. Every culture from the beginning of civilization has had this virtue as a main column of its life. We know this thanks to the artistic legacy that has remained untill our time. If this had not been so, how did the Egyptians build the majestic pyramids with their labyrinths, or how could the great Fibias have only dreamed on the Parthenon? Artistic remains are the best proof of our need of imagination in life.
Even today, dreaming and imagination occupy and essential place in our society, though they have, apparently, nothing to do with science, technology and industrialisation. To prove this we only have to glance at our modern life; each house is full of household appliances such as T.V., video, spin-drier, washing-machine, refrigerator, micro-wave, etc. The same happens in nearly every office where you can find computers, printers, wireless-phones, and probably a fax. All of them have been created by means of modern technology together with creativity.
Another prime manifestation of the importance of imagination in our world is the roll that publicity plays in the market. thats to the image, Fashion, Interior Decoring, and other fields are selling their stocks successfully. Firms are always looking for gifted men, qualified for managing public as they like. They need such a kind of people in order to present their products in a surprising and original way.
Never theless, whoever thinks that in our modern world ther is no longer a place for imagination and dreaming is not mistaken on the whole. Nowadays, it is easy to stop thinking and swallow everything we see aroun us. Authorities of a great number of countries are gettinng alarmed about statistics that show how children sit sown in their sofa and become ""couch potatoes"".
But it is not enough to be alarmed by this passive attitude. We have to take steps to ensure that the problem will have a real solution. This is only possible by going to the roots. The change must begin from childhood because it is in this period when habits are fixed. If the child learns to use his innate creativity, it doesn`t mind what society will probably impose his while growing up. Creativity is something inborn that he is not going to lose and that will be developed during his life.
Actually, the problem is not only related to children. Housewives are so occupied with their jobs that they have no time to prepare nice dishes and put the finishing touch of imagination to them. If you ask someone whether he/she likes walking, painting or listening to music, he/she will answer you: `Oh, hes, of course, I like it. But I can`t waste my time with this sort of things.` The fact is that when we have some spare time, we stick ourselves to television, or we go to places where everything is done for us. The only reason for such a thing is that we are losing our imagination when we get caried away by nowadays life-style.
We need to search for the real meaning of imagination in order to understand how is that we are losing it. Imagination suggests the ability to invent new things or ideas in our mind. The problem is that we have misinterpreted this meaning so we belive that imagination is a waste of time if it is not applied to practical things. In our age, people only use imagination for their benefit in relation with technology, experiments, etc. But when it simply means to dream and try to relax themselves, they reject it, prefering for example to switch on TV.
We must intent to look into ourselves. We have to understand that we were created with the purpose of pleasing our creator. And, as we have been made in God`s own image, we have the inner capacity of creating for pleasure too. If we forget this, our society will be destroyed by those things which origins were product of dreaming and well-applied imagination. The machines we have created will deshumanize us. And then, those who think that in our modern world there is no longer a place for dreaming and imagination will be right.

SPM03052,3.0,2.5,,,,,Crime does not pay,"
This sentence is something very usually heard, with more frequently than we like it. It is a very widespread opinion that the crime is not sufficiently punish.
There are several types of crime: There is a kind of criminals who attact against the persons and others who attack against the properties or institutions.
The first kind of criminal are the worst because is very sad that a person attempt on a property, that he/she steal something or that he/she make any material or economical damage, but it is worse that he/she try to hurt to another person; I refers to cases of violation, abuses, ill treatment and other similar things. Law is, al these cases, when it is less hard with the criminals it is very dificult to show if a person is guilty or not guilty because the trieal is only based on the testimonies of the two parts, and very frequently teh judge can not stablish the truth and by the other hand is very dificult for a person who have hurt any harm damage to prove it, even when somebody is named guilty the pain is very soft and very few times the criminal end his/her pain fully. And, too, there are a lot of cases which never arrive to the court because a great number of them are not denunced.
By the other hand we have the criminals who attack the properties of attack against institutions.
In this group the crimes are more important and frequent but they are less punished. Usually the important people are the one who make it. There are a great number of embezzlement, swindle to public finance and people who have letf with money from his /her own enterprise. There are, too, people who steal into a small scale, they make robberies in small shops or in private residences but we don't know why if this last are catch the normally end their sentences; sometimes they must go to prison or must pay a quantity for their freedom, they almost served. But the first, the people who steal in a greal scale they very few times serve their sentences and as much bigger is the robbery the sentence is smaller; the people who have a great politic power, I am refering to Spain, always get a very good lawyer and they are pardoned most of the tinnes, but nowadays the people is beginning to be tired of this, so the Government has begun to take seriously the subject. Contrary to what the political and great men thought because the Government can not run counter to public opinion, they must held an image. But even now the most part of these cases are still without sentence so in this part of the law the power is on it.
In conclusion the crime does not pay, or at least like it must be, there are times that the sentences are too heavy and othertimes the criminals are pardoned or sometimes they don't serve their sentences fuelly and there are other many tiems that they are not called to trial and it is due to people think the crimes does not pay because many great bussinesmen have a big prestige that they don't deserve. And with the smaller criminals this not happen, law is more eficient and they pay their crime more frequently than the others criminals.
In my opinion the law is not equal, and there are times that a crime is more paid than other similar, only based on the importance of the criminal who have make it. I am disagree with the reduction of the sentences because I think that if a person has ben punshed with a determinate sentence he/she must serve it. So the crime does not pay by everybody in the same way.

SPM04001,3.0,,,,,,Most university degrees are theoretical and do not prepare students for the real world. They are therefore of very little value,"
University degrees are theoretical, they doesn't prepare people for the real world. You go to the university, attend to classes but you don't learn anything about real world. So when you finish your career you are unprepared to face the real world. Universities should be more prepared to give students a real knowledge of what they are going to find when leaving the University.
UNIVERSITY DEGREES ARE ONLY THEORETICAL When students leave the university they have a degree in their hands but they are not prepared for the real world. University degrees do not mean ""preparation for the real life"". This is something more complex.
Students spend lots of years studying, going to classes, reading, preparing exams... Then, most of them finish secondary school and prepare themselves to pass an exam (fair or not pair, I am not going to discuss it) which shows if they are prepared enough to attend University. Some students study the career they have chosen but many others have not the same luck.
Universities are not as great as they seemed to be. They have lots of negative aspects. The worst thing universities have is that they do not prepare people to face the real world. Universities are centres of knowledge but they forget to teach the main subject, the real life. This is paradoxical.
In many cases, students pass the most part of the day in the University; they spend five, six or seven years, sometimes even more, studying their careers, chosing interesting or not interesting subjects. And when finally they get their degrees, they realize that after many years studying, they do not know anything about the world which is outside the walls of the university. Then, students have to start learning the most difficult subject.
That world which is outside the university is not as wonderful as it seems looking it through a window. The real world students find when they leave the university is very hard and full of every kind of difficulties. Nowadays, there is a lot of rivalry. Nobody is going to help you. On the contrary, if they can, they are going to make you falling down. And also, experience is required in most jobs, but students who have just left the university are totally unexperienced, so it becomes a circle, young people need experience to work but if they do not get a job they are not going to be experienced. It sound ridiculous. Another great impediment for students is the new type of contracts of work which are not a good way to start in the real life. All of this can cause a shock in young people who have spent all their lives sutuding in a safe building.
As we have seen, the real world is really difficult and it is a subject forgotten by universities. Most universities are well prepared in their different kinds of studies, and most students get a good knowledge in relation to the field they have been studying. But when they finish their studies they are completely ignorants about the real life. Perhaps, having a lot of theoretical knowledge is not as important as knowing how to manage yourself in a world full of difficulties.
I think, it should be taught something more related with the life, like how to make a curriculum vitae, or how to prepare yourself for an interview of work, what kind of jobs can you apply for, the behaviour in the work, how to make a good usage of all the knowledge you have acquaired in the university... Those things would be very interesting to learn in universities.
So in conclusion, university degrees are of very little value, they are very theoretical and do not prepare students to face the real world. Universities should change their study plans and include more practical classes in order to improve their careers.

SPM04002,2.0,,,,,,The prison system is outdated. No civilized society should punish its criminals: it should rehabilitate them,"
The society had advanced in some countries. The type of crimes and criminals had changed.
The behaviour of criminals should change during their prision sentence.
Criminals shoul reprent of their crimes.
Each case should be studied, each case is different from other.
Criminals should take psychiatric aid.
We should analyse what is wrong in our society, and try to show the mistakes of it to give solutions for them.
The problem of overpopulation in the prison system desperately needs to be resolved by qualified individuals.
Take care with criminals who don't have the purpose of rehabilitate themselves.
ESSAY The prison system is outdated. No civilised society should punish its criminals: it should rehabilitate them. This sentences, an affimation which has two possible attitudes: The first one is to admit this affirmation as the best one. In this case, we are supposed to think that the societies of one determined number of countries has advanced, and in consequence its crimes and criminals also. Everything which changes usually needs to be changed, and there is no doubt that nowdays crimes have changed with respect to the crimes of past periods.
Long ago, crimes basically consisted of stealing objects with great value or stealing food to survive to get rid of hunger. Previously, it was so strange to hear about people being murdered that there was even one newspaper called ""EL CASO"" that was used to especially note the events of this kind which ocurred in Spain. Lon ago, there was plenty of ""Ladrones de guante blanco"" or ""pickpockets"" in English, who rarely commited murders. In opposition, nowdays, there are plenty of murders, and the strange thing is to hear that someone has stolen something from somebody without using violence or without killing people.
Because of this increase of violence, it was necessary to build a lot of prison structures to keep prisoners shut up.
But nowdays, those building structures have become insufficient, due to the fact that there are too many people incarcerated in jails, so there is an overpopulation in the prison system, which desperately needs to be resolved. Some possible solutions which we might consider are: 1. The reduction of prison sentences for less serious types of crimes, such as petty larceny.
2. The construction of more prison structures to keep in jail people who have not served their punishment yet.
3. Check the behaviour from time to time, to observe the possible changes from a good conduct to a worse one or vice versa, from a bad conduct to a better one.
4. Provide prisoners with psychiatric aid, to let them improve their mental health.
5. Adding the death sentence, as some people have suggested, in cases in which a murder has been committed.
6. Other people keep in mind the idea: ""Every men has the right to live"", But this idea brings us to the controversy that: should a man who have killed another, be allowed to have the right to live?
7. Provide prisoners with activities which allow them to improve themselves, and which prepare them to come back into the current society without the feeling of being a failed man or woman who is an outcast within the society of other people.
These activities should consist in things like learning to read and write (the greater part of prisoners are illiterate people), learning to do simple jobs or even complicated ones (for example there is the case of ""El Lute"" who was a man that became a lawyer even though when he was brought in to prison, he was ignorant of how to read and write).
These are some of the possible solution for the problem of overpopulation in jails, but not all the people think that the better solution to resolve the problem is to rehabilitate or to absolve prisoners from their punishements.
The second attitude which we will analyse, is the one which rejects ideas like reducing the duration of punishments and the rehabilitation of criminals.
People who think in this way, are people who really belive that even when someone who has killed somebody and realizes that they way in which he has acted was not the correct way to act, should at any rate pay for the injure provoked to the society.
This is a controversial question, because who is capable of telling a person who has missed a dear relative, or has suffered the direct consequences of an attempt on one's life, that the persone who has caused his or her pain is going to keep his or her freedom without paying for the misfortune that he or she has caused?
In my opinion, to decide which position is the best one is a complicated question, because I think that both positions are logical each one in each own way, but If I should give one answer to this question, my election will be the first one, but with one observation: I will apply it only in cases in which the prisoner has not killed anybody. So my solution will consist in the study of each case, because each case requires a different treatment and in consequence a different solution.

SPM04004,3.5,3.0,,,,,All armies should consist entirely of professional soldiers: there is no value in a system of military service,"
All armies should consist entirely of professional soldiers; nowadays there are only 31.500 professional soldiers in Spain. If it only had professional armies, the unemployment rate would probably decrease; perhaps, more people would choose the army as a profession; so that, nobody would bound to do the military service. All people should have complete freedom to decide what they want to do.
There is no value in a system of military service for several reasons. The first military service for several reasons. The first reason, but not the most important, es the duration of the military service; nine months is excessive because the military preparedness only lasts one month, during the rest of the military service, there are only a few days in which soldiers practice manoeuvres due to the shortage of money. Second, there is no comparison between a professional army (e.g. United States army) and an unprofessional one because of the military preparedness; professional soldiers have a military preparedness much better, these armies dedicate all their time to training, they acquire a lot of lonawhow about guns and militar strategies; therefore, they are qualified to defend their country. In the military service, soldiers, weho have a degree, have different occupations with respect to the other soldiers; some of them are in offices or sick-bays, others work as drivers, etcetera, so that their military preparedness is minimum. In case of war, these soldiers wouldn't be prepared, they wouldn't be able to use agun. Sometimes there is malpractice, that is to say, upper ranks use soldiers to private tasks. The third reason are the problems that the military service can cause in people who are studying or gave an employ; these people have to leave their occupations, workers perhaps have a worse situation because they will have to look for another employ and it is very difficult. Fourth, soldiers are badly paid, salaries are not enough for their subsistence; for example, in Spain unprofessional soldiers earn 1.200 pesetas in a month; during the military service, they make inroads into the money they had saved. A political party has promised to increase the salaries of the soldiers to 30.000 is he win the general el in 1998. Finally, the military service can produce mental disorders in the soldiers because they are always under pressure, and, besides, novices are victims of practical joices.
For all these reasons, in Spain, there are far fewer soldiers than there used to be; young people prefer doing social services to doing the milityary service. The last year, there were more than 70.000 conscientious objectors, 25.000 of them were collegiates. the conscientious objection is the only legal solution to avoid the militar service; however, most of the objectors criticize the excessive duration of the social service: 13 months. The political party, that I have mentioned above, have also promided to reduce the duration of the social service to nine months and the militar service to six months; another political party has promised to do aqay with the militar service.
However, people think that their promises( the increase of the salaries of the soldiers, the reduction in the duration of the social and miltitary services) are only a wat to obtain votes.

SPM04010,2.5,,,,,,All armies should consist entirely of professional soldiers: there is no value in a system of military service,"
The fact that the militar service is obligatory is considered in many social sectors like a useless waste of time, because in most cases only can be considered useful a minimal period in what the soldiers learn the most basic things, that, in reality, would not be useful in case of war.
The rest of time is used to realize works that almost ever have relation to militar aspects, like, for example, to make photocopies, and that could be realice by persons who does not be integrated in the army.
If the military service was completly professional it would prevent a lot of these defects. In the first place, if it was remunerated would provoke that many youngs, by own initiative, would opt for its realization. Moreover, the soldiers would be trained constantly so the efficiency in case of military conflict would be bigger.
This last aspect can be appreciate if we notice in armies of other countries which have opted by this system, like in the case of the United States of America; but in this case the armies are formed on the whole by people without economic resources.
On the other hand, establishing of professional army results difficult in a lot of countries because it collides with the constitutional principles or laws.
In the case of Spain there is an article that says that all the spanish people are obligated to defend Spain. This is one of the principal aspects that produce the existence of the military service such as we know, also we also admite the objection of conscience.If we establish the professional army we will have to modificate the Constitution, so the defence of the country only will be encomended to a reduced group of people and the rest will keep out.
We have previously refered to the objection of consciense, something wich can be practised by men or women independent of the sectorr of the society they belong to.
Most of young men who are not in accordance with the military service, choose this method to serve the society. They think that is possible to render a service to their country without taking up the arms. In most cases they assist people who need help, like old people, young people who have problems with drugs, invalid people, etc.
In Spain the objection is taken like a punishment to people who not want to spend her time with the military service. They say that is not just that military service has a duration of nine months, while they must realize their service during thirteen months.
There are also people that hate the military service and are not in accordance with the objection of conscience. They are integrated in a movement which in Spain is called ""Insumision"". In most cases they are being jailed but in spite of it the number of members of this movement is reciently increasing.
In conclusion, I think that the system of military service such as we Know in our country is not beneficial because most of youngs men don't have motivation for the military defence in case of war. It would not happen if the armies were composed by professional soldiers. In this case they could be smallers and soldiers would have a training better than in the case of the military service.

SPM04015,3.0,2.0,,,,,"Some people say that in our modern world, dominated by science and technology and industrialisation, there is no longer a place for dreaming and imagination. What is your opinion?","
The modern world is headed by science technology and industrialisation. Progress is considered by most of the people essential for a better welfare - the most inmediate aspiration of the humanity -. On the other hand, there are people who see technology and industrialisation as an arm which can harm humanity so much as it can help in many fields.
Science technology and industrialisation, from the XIX century up til now have gone very fast; even, some people who were pleased with this progress before now are surprised because it seems to them to be out of their age. First, it was the electricity (light, telephone, industrial machines and television) and it constituted a great step in many aspects; it constituted the pass from the ""middle ages of the modern world"" to a more comfortable world, if it is, of the neverending loved and hated progress. Hence, the computers, the video cameras, the movible telephones, the satellites are real dreams of the Julio Verne(s) of the world. It is obvious the improvements of the life; better medical machines and studies, all kinds of medicines; thanks to communication satellites all over the world, information is attended making a sense of responsability about others and all abou the world; although, it is shown too the wars, the poverty of the underdeveloped world remembering us the progress does not do all and it is not everywhere.
As it can be deduce, technology and industrialisation is applied in different fields in order to improve the welfare. Analizing the results of that application in the developed countries, it can be said that there are advantages respect to the economy (the most advanced technology a country has, the the most rich and powerful it is); and, to the society (better sources and quality of life).
It seems sensible to believe, as most of the people do, that progress is essential for getting a worthy life. As human beings As human beings tend to achieve a perfect state, maybily it could not be done without the progress.
Progress means evolution and human beings tend to evolve, it is an inherent quality of them and, progress helps to get his goal of humanity in two ways. First, progress is the result of the efforts and the creative action of humanity, it stimulates the very inner nature of men and women. Second, it is also at the same time the cause of the point of departure a great chain of posterior achievements. So, humanity envolves in behalf of progress and progress envolves thanks to the aspirations of humanity.
However, the advances of technology and industrialisation have also a dangerous face which derives, on one side from the results of the applications of the progress and, on the other side, from the ""bad"" application of this progress.
The high economic level adquired from the technology and industrialisation belongs to the developed countries but it is not extended or share with the underdeveloped countries. Besides, the latters are dependent of the formers. The paradox of the progress os that it serves to the evolution of humanity but only a part of this humanity; and, all humanity tends to the evolution. So, progress forgets solidarity. Another paradox is that progress gives, it is supposes, a better welfare to all men and women but only a few of them enjoy it. The right of a worthy existence is limited by the progress when it must served to all humanity. So, what dominated the modern world is not just progress but materialism and individual interest against comunity.
In this sense of individuality, a materialistic and physic one, many people believe that advances of the technology and industrialisation do not let time or place to dream or to the imagination. With the progress, the spiritual world of the people has been displaced in order to be only an owner of power: money, a good job, house or car. That is also a paradox, people want to have an identity respect from the others but forget the essential identity of all human being, hir or her own soul, personality. Thing that, like money power, reduces the person to a machine of his or her century and also lets the solidarity out the main goals of that is called ""modern world"".
The other consequence of the ""bad"" application of the progress is that of the arms, the bombs, all the machines made for disorder the world. Of course, all this problems presided by the aim of individuality and politic, economical and cultural power, the dark face of the progress.
As a conclusion, I think it is too extreme to affirm that the progress if good or bad for the world. The growth of the progress was not for making damage to the world, but on the contrary, it was a new age dreaming with a general welfare. The real problem is to make bad use of the advantages or of the results of progress; to use them against the humanity and their natural tendency.

We live in a society in which military recruitment's system is not approved by the great majority. The logic would be to require specialized people, men or women. As we all know, Military Service requires masculine population in order to do one's military instruction. We all know too, that on the other hand, it exists conscientious objectors and unsubmissives.
A the present time I don't think that Military Service must be necessary but optional. Countries have formed blocs: for example, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization ( N.A.T.O. ) in the occidental case, and the Warsaw Pact in the East countries; in case it have broken a conflict they have known how to act. They will do better if they save suffering and time to people who do not really feel able to shoot a weapon or, simply and plainly who do not support the fact of being recruited far from their houses for at least, one year.
There are some reasons which esplain why voluntary service is criticized and also advice the increase of professional soldiers: first, the descent in Europe of young people of military age and second, the increase of conscientious objectors.
It exists Military Academies which have to prepare those persons who, by their own will, wish to be trained in the military discipline because they want to exercise professionally that job in society as anybody else between us want to study medicine or english philology.
There are people who share the opinion that doing Military Service involve a useful experience and a way of mature in life; on the other hand, others comment that the fact is that once you are inside, if you like it, you can even re-enlist, either serving Obligatory Service, Voluntary Service, Special Voluntary Service, or finally a Service to command dashboard formation and complement scales especialist and naval reserve. But I think that a non-commissioned officer does not get the category which is required by a professional soldier, a man equipped and trained by the state in order to defend the country. I believe that many opt for this option because it is an insured job, and money at the end of the month.
People who participate in the defence of a country must be prepared, and what I do not think is that simple artillery can develop a task which is not permited since they do not have necessary knowledges.
We know that at the end of the 18th century the appearance of the war mass would bring the obligatory Military Service. It gave up professional armies from being the only defenders of the motherland, while their fellow country-men could continue without inconvenience their ordinary way of life.
In occidental countries, military institutions are assumed with a lot of political and economic conditionings. But nowdays, war's character has changed: nuclear weapons and guerrillas warfare require only a minority who has to attend to weapons.
I would like to mention some examples of countries which have a voluntary system, as the United States of America, England, Canada, Austria, Ireland, Bangla Desh, India, Japan and Pakistan. On the contrary, it occurs the same in some countries of little significance which have high incomes as Luxemburg and United Arabic Emirates.
To finish, I would like to say that it always exists occupations much more lucratives.

SPM04021,3.0,4.0,,,,,All armies should consist entirely of professional soldiers: there is no value in a system of military service,"
Since a few years' time, the maintenance of compulsory military service has become a controversial topic in countries like Spain. When Spanish politicians started to think about making a shorter military service, public opinion in the country also began to wonder if it was really necessary to maintain it at all. Another question was if a professional army wouldn't be a better choice. Although many people think that a professional army would bring more problems than benefits, there seems to be much more reasons for abolishing military service and creating an army of professional soldiers.
Military service is a means of making teenagers lose a stage of their lives which is one of the most importatn, as it is when they have to decide what they want to do with their academic of professional careers. Moreover, the objectives of this system are not others that preparing men for war. Then, it is understandable that most of the teenagers have a negative attitude towards military service. For this reason, political parties are planning to reduce the amount of time of military service to six month and increase the pay to thirty thousand pesetas. But this means that the main objective of the army wouldn't be achieved, as it is impossible to prepare someone phisically and psichologically for war in such a short time. This contradiction could disappear by the creation of a professional army. It would not only mean clarifying the expectations of many young men, but also having a suitable means of defence in case of war.
In contrast to the general idea that military service reduces the differences between people, since everybody fight's for one's country, it is just the opposite. For example, inequalities are shown by the fact that a university students would get a higher post than a butcher would.
It is thought that there wouldn't be enough volunteers in order to create a Spanish professional army, but the fact is that the army is a second choice for many people who has found problems when trying to work. Morever, the rate of unemployment is higher in Spain than in countries such as the United Stated, where the tests to enter the army are quite difficult now, as there are many applicants.
Finally, everybody thinks that military service is the best and only way for a teenager to become a man, that is to say, to mature. But even a better way to achieve this is knowing other cultures, other customs, other peoples...
Therefore, the government should try to invest more money and more efforts in order to make cultural interchanges easier and cheaper for young people.

SPM04022,3.5,3.0,3.0,2.0,3.0,3.0,Most university degrees are theoretical and do not prepare students for the real world. They are therefore of very little value,"
Most University degrees are theoritical and do not prepare students for the real world. They are, therefore, of very little value. Students graduates with excelents academic curriculums are not enough prepared for the job that it is supposed thay have to develop, because in most universities there isn't any practise at all, practically the whole of the classes are thoretical and fills the student mind with a lot of knowledge that, in the most of the cases are not practise. In fact, when these excelents students finish their degrees and go to asking for a job they are always asked the same question: ""and, what do you know to do?, do you have any experience or any practise?"". The answer in the most of the cases are ""No"".
There are some Universities that can not to offer any practise to their students for several reasons: first,there are too much students, and they can not offer practise to all of them. Second, this practise implies a cost that many Universities can not pay. Another reason is that private enterprises sometimes don't want to proporcionate facilities to the University for their student's practices, but, maybe, it is not a problem of the University but the private enterprise. In the cases that this enterprises accept students for doing practices, these students are not payed at all, and they are taking the job of the other people. The students are sometimes exploted, and therefore, they are not motivated. These preactices are not such practices in some cases, because the enterprises don't let the student to asume any responsability and s/he doen't learn very much. Sometimes the practices are not related with their degrees.
The University should be prepared for proporcionate all the students the necessary practice for developing their future work in the best way possible. In scientifices degrees, for instance, is very important that the student had enough practice. Do you imagine an engineer that does't knew what is a screw?!. It must seem like a joke, and it is exagerate, of couse, but it is true that students of scientific degrees haven't seen a laboratory the enough times that they need.
In the Humanities degrees the situation is worse, if it can be. These students have a very few practice. They have to memorize too much theory that it is useless. In degrees like Laws, the students have to memorize all the codes, all the laws, the civil law, the labour law, the criminal law, and so on. The lawyers don't need all this things because they are all in the books. On the other hand, they need to practice their knowledge in order not to forget it, and for being objectives in their work, and, in sum, for being a good lawyer. The students of Laws don't have any practice in their degrees, but they are exiged two years of experience to enter to the laboral world. How can we explain it?
In studies of languages, the University doesn't proporcionate the students enough facilities for studying in a country in which the language they are learning is spoken. That is essential for the preparation of the student. The student have to search and to pay for their studies in other countries in the most of the cases, excepting all those very good students, of course.
In fact, the practice is adquired with the years, and one is better in his/her job with the years of experience, however, one must have a minimun of practice when s/he finish his/her degree. Some degrees are too long and of very little value, in some cases is a waste of time to be in theUniversity five or six years, studying something that it is not usefull at all. I think that is urgent to find a solution for this problem. The world demands new graduates with a lot of characteristics and qualities that the graduate doesn't have because the University hasn't given it. That is not for the own graduate's blame, but the Educational System, the Goverment, or I don't know the really blamer of this situation, but, one thing is clear: it is needed a reform urgently.

SPM04023,3.0,2.0,,,,,Feminists have done more harm to the cause of women than good,"
Feminists have done more harm to the cause of women than good.
I think that feminists have contributed to the improvements in the life of women.
At the beggining of this century, women in Britain couldn't vote, stand in public office, enter any of the professions or most well-paid jobs, be awarded a university degree, control their fertility, or share guardianship of their children. The brave women who campaigned for these rights were ridiculised and those who took vident actions were imprisoned. The campaign of these women over many years eventually won them equal rights. They were fighting not onlythe prejudices of their own times, but a legacy of thought which had for centuries defined women as inherently inferior to men and sought to control them by making them the virtual property of their fathers and husbands.
From the early 1890s, the debate about the lack of political rights of women was a live issue on which most people had an opinion. Two groups of women made sure that women's suffrage was kept in the public eye.
The suffragists believed that law'abiding campaigning and appeal to reasonableness in men would eventually win women the vote. Led by Millicent Garrett Fawcett, they organised a network of local National Union of Women's Suffrage Societies, arranged meetings and rallies, lobbied Parliament and published their own newspaper.
There were militant suffragettes of the Women's Social and Political Union, led by Emmeline and Christobbel Pankhurst, were more impatient with the lack of progress for women and organised more dramatic demonstrations. On Derby Day 1913, one suffragette, Emily Davidson, threw herself under the King's horse and was killed.
However, in the event, it took a world war to win British women the vote. Both wings of the suffrage movement encouraged women to engage in war work. Women responded in large numbers and by the end of the war 90% were doing work done by men, though far less pay. Having landed their efforts, it was difficult for the Government to deny them political rights, though initially the vote was only granted to women over 30, so they wouldn't outnumber male voters. It was necessary ten years before women won the vote on the same terms as men.
Women have for a long time been active in the organisations which have grown up to improve and protect the environment in which we live, physical and social.
Thereare now around ten million women in paid employment. Many women work part time. Those who work full time earn an averaged two-thirds as much as men. There are fewer women involuntarily unemployed.
Jobs done mainly or wholly by women are paid relatively low rates, perhaps because they are done by women whose bargaining powers have been relatively weak. Women work less overtime.
In education the great majority of class teachers in the primary schools are women. In 1960 a quarter of all university students were women.
The new women graduates of the 80s and 90s will probably soon change the balance of the sexes in the higher jobs.

SPM04026,3.5,,,,,,All armies should consist entirely of professional soldiers: there is no value in a system of military service,"
It would be useful that the Forces count on a bigger number of professional soldiers,since they are much more prepared for confront military subjects and for face up to technical difficulties;this is due to the acquired experience in the long time that they spend there.In contrast,the soldiers that stay a few months,doing military service,are not able to stand up to some problems;arsenal,every time more sophisticated,needs people well drilled(such a thing cannot be achieved in a traditional military service).Neither,this last kind of soldiers are very resistants,the most of the psychological casualties happens between them,this reveals their lack of professional attitude.There are many examples of the importance of technology and good instruction,such as the United Kingdom proved with its All Volunteer Force in the Gulf's War(1991);the Brithish soldiers also defeated to an army more numerous than its own in Falkland Isles,they do it just in three weeks.Another extremely well known case is the one that culminated in the end of the Second World War,the atomic bomb hurling by United States in Hiroshima and Nagasaki.
There are some people that think that obligatory military service is democratic,arguing its levelling effects;whichever people's social class is,they have to do it.But nothing is further from reality.It does not respect individual's freedom because the government forces boys to do training.As a result of this,youngs stay reluctantly in the camp,againts their will.In addition, they are almost unpaid.If people did it of their own volition,the situation would change,they would go there with desire,putting their attention on it,and,maybe,they will be well rewarded.Other reason that can be given to see it as a non democratic system is recruit's discrimination depending on his academic level,giving the better position to university student.Opposed to military service,professional army feeds on humble inhabitants;the United States Forces constitute an interesting example of this,they are formed in the main by poor South American immigrants.
As a general rule,volunteer soldiers are people that have few takings prospects in civil life,while military service is did by all.Moreover,minorities possess great possibilities of social promotion within the military institution;such is the case of the general Collin Powell,president of Chief of Staff's Assembly,or of the liutenant-colonel John W.Shanon,secretary of the Army(both were black soldiers and of a very poor origin).
A professional army also carries with it some risks,like inclination to take part in politics.When Forces interest does not agree with government interest,legions start to participate in this subject.This is an hypothesis based on historical facts,but perhaps there is no reason to fear it nowadays.Countries such as United States, Great Britain or Canada have never to care about this kind of troubles.On the other hand,to depend on obligatory soldiers does not seem to be a deterrent generalship to the military men participants in a coup d'tat,as it was showed in Spain with the assault to the House of Commons by the liutenant-colonel Tejero(23th February,1982).
One prominent disadvantage of the binding recruitment,paying a ridiculous amount,is the creation of a levy in kind that falls on a minority group in a discriminatory way.A volunteers' system would be surely more equitable with the costs.This system is being the subject of a lot of argument in Spain at the moment,since it remains a month and a few days till March general election and the candidate for Prime Minister of the right wing tends to make a professional army.Many military men dread this option because they think that citizens are going to detach from the Forces.It is demonstrated by many surveys:half of Spanish people would not take arms before foreign attack;even more,boys' view about military service is worst after their graduation.It is difficult that exist volunteers with such a feeling againts it.

1. Importance of the work.
2. Computer generation.
3. Time for leisure.
4. Man and machine.
5. Person in the society after the development of science.
6. Comparison with previous societies.
The development of science and technology has led our society to a new generation of men and women without originality. Imagination and dreaming seem now less important than before and our world is a world governed by the idea of material progress, but personal.
The aim of the present paper is to show technique has changed the society. In order to do so, the main emphasis will be placed in the effects of that man calls progress.
Human being has transformed Nature and also himself by work and the technologycal effort has been the base for the growth of human achievements. Thus, intelligence has been employed as a way to promote the explotation of sources and as a instrument to create several types of prototypical males and females.
The old and medieval societies conceived the progress as a lack of starvation and suffering guided by the power of religion. Then, as a result of separation with God, man starts a great age of discoveries related to the universe, the body and occasionally the soul. But it's with the origin of the industrialisation and the increase of population when individuals begin the work in chain; consecuently, particular and daily objects become so artificial that lose their primitive charm.
Nowadays, the huge cities are the laboratories where we can confine the effects of the technologycal development that have resulted in a society of consume.
People work extremely hard. The obssesion for work is not only achieve greater status or prestige, but simply to have more of the material objects and comfort that money can buy. So many, unfortunately, we either have little leisure time or don't know how to enjoy it.
Now, pleisure doesn't consist on listening Vivaldi or watching a good film of Chaplin, even reading and talking with friends (the best ways to personal enrichment) are substituted by more comfort and expensive hobbies like multifunctional diskettes of arrangers.
We work for things basically connected with external aspects (success, economical security,...). It seems that our soul is only peaceful when our pockets are quite full.
We live in a very competitive society and the existence of this competition has always meant doing things because they win us some essentially advantages. But the aim of our fortune must be to integrate the doing with its own reward like personal satisfation.
In this point we should controvert of the current technology.
It's alarming that children instead of learning mental arithmetic grow up believing that calculaters are their right. Adults buy computers wich teach them a dead vocabulary that owes nothing to Shakespeare or Milton and boring, mindless contents that use nothing to Philosophy or History. They only produce laziness and discontent.
As for thinking, our computers will do it for us, so all the little details of our lives can be stored in nasty, cold brains.
The computer generation assumes that it's better to calculate, tell the time, work out the holiday plans, pay the bills and shop with the aid of computer. After all, this civilisation is founded now on the certainty that we can even kill by remote control.
The age of the computer is the age of dehumanisation. Due to this factor individuals are products of a collectivity which holds enough power to establish a good deal of models to be followed; therefore, what people have to do is choosing one of these models instead of creating one by themselves.
This sticks out the power of communication and persuasion, both have a very close relationship.Mankind has lost its freedom of thought influenced by the media, the religion and also the science. Indeed, in the day-to-day traffic of social contact, communication is inseparable from persuasion. Everyone is his own public relations officer, every action and actitude which is observed by other people is conditioned by the instinct to show oneself in the best possible light.
Person is no more an element of personal decision, in a whole, person is just an image eternally repeated of a society where to have is quite important than to be. Nevertheless, happiness is measured by the quantity of material objects that one has. Out present idealisms aren't moral but practical.
Machines provide us a knowledge about the eternal world but what is really important is to get to know and understand man. Thus, we'll be able to appreciate the past (our history) and the future.
It seems that mankind has used the intelligence to produce several things which have helped us to survice, but that intelligence hasn't developed our imagination to build a peaceful and better world and it also has disminished our capacity to dream a hopeful future.
To sum up we ought to remember that machines won't feel for us. It today we call to robots humanoids maybe tomorrow, in the same way, we'll have to call robotoids to human beings.

SPM04030,1.5,2.5,,,,,Most university degrees are theoretical and do not prepare students for the real world. They are therefore of very little value,"
When you choose to study an university career, you expect you may get a job within the branch you have chosen; but in the majority of the cases, that is not so. A boy or a girl, who is studing a career, expects that he or she may get a good occupation or at least something.
Most university degrees are theoretical and do not prepare students for the real world. This is true but the best of this is everybody knows what is happening but nobody tries to do anything.
We, Students, have just finished our careers and we are not prepared ourselved to face the laboral world. When you are going to look for a job, you take your curriculum vitae, that is full of good things but when you are asked if you have some experience in some similar job, you have to answer no; then you have no longer any possibility.
I think that this method is not very good because, then if there is not anybody who may give us a job, then we will never work because we will never have any experience.
I believe that university studies must be reformed. I think that if one person is doing an university career that is five years long, that person has to begin his/her practices more or less in the third year of the career. If one person is doing an university career that is three years long, that person has to begin his/her practises in the second year of the career.
University help us to think. In other countries, pupils are appreciated by their marks and by their intelligence. Experience is not important for them because experience can be taught, but intelligence cannot. In our country, experience is acquired through the masters.
When you are working, your universitary knowledges are forgotten if you do not work in what you have studied, and that does not occur in the majority of cases. When you are going to present yourself for a job interview, you know you are not going to be chosen by your curriculum but you will be employed or not depending on what you tell in the interview and sometimes you will have to answer ridiculous questions.
Womer are the worker who find less jobs. When a man is interviewed, he is asked indispensable things for the selection of a candidate. Nevertheless, when a woman is interviewed, she is asked things as if she has a boyfriend, if she thinks to marry, if she wants to have children etc. I think that those questions have not to be asked because the interviewers must research a professional profile.
Experience is what has more value nowadays. There are many people that do not have any university degree but those people have a permanent job; nevertheless, there are many people that have one, two and up to three university degrees and they have not any job.
I think this is unjust because if you have been acquiring knowledges during three, four, five, etc. years, you should have your reward finding a job to get your independence. Then, I may have all university degrees that I want by these degrees have not any value if you have not experience, then it is better for us not to study and to search small jobs to acquire experience. Here, then, I ask myself: Why are we studying? The answer would be: we are studying to acquire some culture, but culture does not feed us, then what must we do? We have not found the answer yet.
Sometimes I ask myself why I am studying and I ask myself why I did not leave the institute in order to work, I do not know but when I see my old friends have a fixed job, and they only have passed the second course of B.U.P., I put very nervous because I think that is unjust.
I do not understand if people know most university degrees only are theoretical and that they are useless because they do not do anything to change it.
If world is requiring prepared students practically, society should consider the possibility of changing the courses of studies to a more practical manner.

SPM04031,4.0,3.5,,,,,All armies should consist entirely of professional soldiers: there is no value in a system of military service,"
All armies should consist entirely of professional soldiers: there is no value in a system of military service as the Spanish one, for example. Though armies are institutions that should not exist, in the world where we live, with continuous conflicts among nations and civil wars (a good example is the well-known confrontation in the ex-Yugoslavia), they are a need, the mechanism for the defence of the interests and society of a country. This is the reason why armies existed, exist and will exist.
This purpose of defence is very, very important for the nation, not only for the possibility of wars (against foreign countries or civil wars) but to solve any problem of state that could require the intervention of a corps of prepared, specialized people ready to protect the nation and to fight for it. Such an important, trascendental mission must be trusted on people explicitly prepared to develop it. Not everybody is able to do this work, and so the Governments must understand that the defence of the nation must be encommended to people who really want to be a militar and accept their way of life. The acts that these persons would do, as professionals of the armed forces, would be, in case of necessity, much better than the ones that a group of persons trained during a few months -sometimes, years ago - can do. This is the first reason I can argue in defence of the establishment of professional armed forces.
In my case, I have heard my father and my grandfather talk about this subject with my brother (he will pass this year the medical exam required to do the military service) and they argue a very common reason among people of their age: ""with the military service, the child becomes a man"". I think that today this process to maturity is achieved by a suitable education, but, maybe I can understand this position going back in time to the Civil War, the hardest times Spain has passed in many years, years of misery and poverty where the whole majority of men were in the army, that was seen, during the war and during the dictatorial regime that came after it, as the best thing a young man could do. Now, in these days, if we think about all the opportunities young men have (I say ""men"" because the obligatory recruitment is only for them; women who want to do the military service are volunteers), we will conclude that the military service is not neither a need not a benefit for them.
The possibility to develop a universitary degree is one of the things that have changed from the times of our parents or grandparents. Today, a great percentage of young men achieve this kind of studies but, if they have to do the military service, in Spain they have two options: the first one is to finish the ""C.O.U"" (preparatory course for the access to University exams), to do the exam I have just referred and, before the beginning of the degree, entry in the army. This first option means to loose one year of your academic career for nothing. The second one is to do the military service after you have finished the degree, and this represents a delay in the possibilities to find a job, to marry, to travel for your degree's enrichment, to study post-graduate courses... In both cases, the military service means a waste of time.
Another opinion that people who defend the obligatory military service usually have is that everybody who is born and live in a country must defend it in any case, and the army is the best way to do it. Of course, the individual must protect his/her country's interests, but, aren't there any other forms, much better than that, to defend them? A country has not only military interests: what can we say about social, economical, sanitary, educational, cultural, environmental interests? Doctors, teachers, lawyers, scientists, workers... help the growing of the country and maintain with their work what is more important; the welfare state. Do they really need a military service?
Present and future Governments should open their eyes and notice that this model of army could be useful twenty five or thirty years ago, but today it is unnecessary: probably there would be more voluntary molitars if they could have better living conditions, better materials and methods of training and a good salary. If nobody is forced by law to be a doctor, for example, why people is forced to be a militar (at least during a few months)?

SPM04032,3.5,2.5,,,,,Crime does not pay,"
Now, the first thing that comes to my ming it's an article I read (I don't remember when) in the Speak Up magazine called Crime and Punishment. The article was directed?? by John McVicar, an ex-preso who after spending a lot of time in prison became a writer and he talked about his experiences as a criminal, as a prisoner and now as a free person who The aim of this paper is to show my disagreement with what the title (topic) of this essay wants to mean or what I understand that it is trying to mean, that it is that crime is not paid. The way I am going to develop my opinion is basing it in a famous novel by Dostoiewski, in a report published in the Speak Up magazine, in certain actual events that had ocurred in our society and in my personal opinion.
The first thing I want to do is to say that the topic should be Crime and Punishment. Why of this tile? Simple. The title come from the famous novel by the Russian writer Fedor M. Dostoiewsky, Crime and Punishment. This novel was published in 1866. This novel tells the story of Raskolnikof, a young student that lives in San Petersburgo in the most absolute misery. Some circunstances make him to commit assassination. But, after doing it, this student is overwhelmed by the thoughts of doubt and remorse that continuosly appear in his mind.
This story helps me as an example of a type of chastisement. Not always punishment means going to prison of being executed. Sometimes is worst the moral hurt that a person can suffer through out his/her life as happens to the protagonist.
Other example in which I base my opinion of that crime is always punished, in an interview appeared in the Speak Up magazine, number 116 in the year 1995. The interviewed is John McVicar, a former criminal who served a total of 26 years in prison for armed robbery and who escaped twice while serving his sentence. He is the opposite case of the character appeared in Dostoiewski's novel. He was not poor, his background was not bad at all. At the request of the magazine about: ""does crime pay?"", John Mc. answers ""I think you have to be foolish to say that it does not"".
In my opinion, this is a good proof of that crime is punished. He is a good example; he has suffer punishment on his own. This contradicts the original topic of that crime does not pay.
The third example in which I base my opinion is the actual social situation that has happened in many countries in the last few years. All of us could have seen that many politicians, bankers, people of a high life-style, had had to resign from their respective occupations because they commit crime, a different one from the ones previously mentioned (assassination in the first case and armed robbery in the second). They have stolen, they are corrupt. They have been doing it for a long time and, because they had been discovered, most of them are still paying their ""faults"" or ""mistakes"" or are waiting to be punished.
The last part of my essay is going to be about my personal opinion of crime in general.
I think that crime must be punished. Thieves, corrupts, assassins... sooner or later pay their crimes because it does not exist the perfect one. Crime means punishment in the future.

SPM04033,3.0,3.0,,,,,"Some people say that in our modern world, dominated by science and technology and industrialisation, there is no longer a place for dreaming and imagination. What is your opinion?","
The aim of the present essay is to explain what reasons provoke nowadays the lack of dreaming and imagination in our society. In the modern world the advances in technology and industralization have imposed a particular life style that has provoked that people scarcely have time to do what they would like to. In spite of this, people find some time to do it.
First of all, I'd like to point out the importance in the present time of the incorporation of high technology in most of jobs. New techniques are incorporated; for example, in the case of computers, new programs are created to facilitate the way people work. These incorporations oblige people to learn new things very frecuently in order to be prepare enough; so, besides of learning, they have to work and (usually in the case of women) they have to attend the house also.
In consequence to this, people are very busy and tired. Moreover, the pressure at work provoke competence between the workers. So they are worried because they have to work hard in order to get a promotion or simply in order to keep the job. This tense situation creates anxiety, stress and nervousness.
The next reason is related to the developments of cities in the modern world. Most of people live far from the inner city and they have to drive to the place they work in. So, everyday they have to wake up very early and have to suffer the huge traffic jams during at least one hour, what produces anxiety and nerves again. On the other hand, if they live near the inner city they will have to wait for the subway or the buses in the crowed platforms during the peak hours, if they decided not to take the car in order to arrive sooner at work.
All I have mentioned before implies that people are frecuently very tired at the end of a working day. All they want to do in this situation, when they finally arrive at home, is try to sleep.
This frenetic life style has made people worried about promotions, money, new techniques etc, and it seems like if they were no longer worried about anything else. But, in spite of this, I think people still today spend some time dreaming or imaginig. Everybody needs time to relax thinking about a good place to do to in vacation. Everybody needs to forget the stress and to escape, at least for a while, from pressure, hurry, noises, smoke... Otherwise, they wouldn't go to see films from time to time, they wouldn't read novels, they wouldn't travel or they wouldn't walk with a friend.
In fact, these frecuent activities is what most of people life to do in their free time. All of these imply dream or imagine in some way. This prove that eventhough our modern world imposes us a busy and stressed life people find time to do what they like to.
To sums up, all I have mentioned before lead us to the conclusion that if our lifes were a little ""easier"" and we wouldn't be dominated by a world that is constantly changing, due to new techniques and industrialization, we could enjoy doing things as dream and imagine more frecuently. Dreaming and imagining are human ""necessities"" and still in our stressed lifes we can go it; at least during the weekend or in vacation.

SPM04034,3.0,3.0,,,,,"Some people say that in our modern world, dominated by science and technology and industrialisation, there is no longer a place for dreaming and imagination. What is your opinion?","
Nowadays, the industrialisation and technology have a great importance in the world, because these techniques have helped a lot to improve different aspects of our life.
In the last centuries, people didn't enjoy the technological advances but I think, these improvements don't impede the capacity of dream or imagina, because these men's values are one of the most important treasures that men can posses.
It's possible that this topic is said because actual life is very complicate and extremely full of worries. There are several technological elements that one hundred years ago, don't exist, such as television, radio, video, cars, and all kind of machines in the job, in house, in everyplaces which have done us better the life. These improvements have benefit us in part, for example to make your life more comfortable, but in the other hand, youaccustom not to give strength, I mean, than with all technological and industrial advances have done people accustom the things be done alone, and consequently, if a machine can do something that you must do. you choose the machine work for you, then this problem of vagueness affect your ming and the capacity of dreaming and imagination too.
Although many things have been invented lengthwise of years, this reason cann't wuit to use men's capacity for thinking. When I speak with my friends themes similar to this, I always say that in spite of all developments, the imagination is something that nothing and nobody can surpass, better said somebody is possible do it with his/her own imagination.
I try to say that the dreaming or imagination are insuperables qualities. In my case, for example when I studied in secondary school, I had time to do other things that I like such as hobbies, do exercise, play football or other sports, go to cinema or museums, travel and other things I like, but now in the university, at least the days of work, I have no time to do it. This is an example that the occupation or intensive work can impede realize other tasks, that I would like.
In the past, society hadn't this problem, because they don't think in this, they haven't the contemporanean advances but today the technology and industrialisation cann't impede a place for dreaming and imagination by a lot of reasons, if people haven't dreams (when we talk about dreams, I mean things that someone wants to do, to indulge in groundless hopes in the life etc.) their lifes lack sense and the imagination ocurs the same It's impossible that people abandon their illusions which are born from the imagination and dreams, in conclusion from our mind.
In my opinion, people who think that in our modern world there is no longer a place for dreaming and imagination is mistaken, by the reason explain. Perhaps, the fact of our modern world with its developments have produced above all in big cities a stress, a lack of time to do it, but it's necessary for living, and we hadn't these capacities of at least not practice them, we would fall in routine and the life wouldn't have sense.

SPM04039,3.5,3.0,,,,,"In his novel ""Animal Farm"" George Orwell wrote ""All men are equal but some are more equal than others"". How true is this today?","
George Orwell states in his novel ""Animal Farm"" the sentence that follows: ""All men are equal: but some are more equal than others"", causing a controversial as regards the subject. The term equality is defined in the dictionaries as ""the state of being equal"". Nevertheless, the term is associated to different aspects of the human beings in terms of rights, status, ability, rank, and privileges, mainly.
I strongly believe that a person cannot be more equal than another because the equality it exists or it doesn't exist. In my opinion, it doesn't exist since each human being is different to the others. The followin are some of the factors regarding this inequality connected to external attributes of the individual. First of all, it is necessary to point out the existence of divers sex. This aspect is the one that attrated in a particular way my attention seeing that just by being a woman or a man the treatment it establishes is contrary. This discrimination toward women has been widely discussed and eventhough there has been some progress in recent years, still receive a lot of unfairness in terms of employment and development. Second, we notice the divers human races as an irrational factor to treat a person as a minor, because He/She possesses a different skin colour or constractive traditions. There are some other reasons, as the diversity of political parties or religions which even if they are inexcusable I find them acceptable since everyone must be at liberty to think whatever He/She believes just as long as He/She respects the other's thoughts.
Another important constituent is the environment; it is clear that a person who is born in Africa or in any other Third World country will have more problems to develop than other who is born in Europe. And even in the same country or city there always are several inequalities in the matter of social dealings. This point is quite consequential in view of the fact that nowadays the society is guided by money, power and ambition, creating a materialism as a way of life. This materialism gives rise to the egoism, an unconcern of other's plights, resulting a significant obstable to construct a society based on equality.
About this subject, the french philosopher of the eighteen century J.J. Rousseau argued in his essay ""Discours sur l'origine de l'ingalit"" that the inequality appeared at the moment there were different sex and what it is more surprising when ""the natural human being"" found that there were more creatures like him with capacity of reason. Another essential factor for him is the appearance of the concept ""property"" united with ""agriculture"" and ""sociability"". Therefore, it arose divers social ranks, the rich and the poor that depended on the property they had.
In addition to these external considerations it is also needed to denote the aspects which are relevant to the individual as a human being concerning the equality. Each person possesses peculiar or even unique interests, capacities, abilities and resources, among others. Every individual pursues some distinc objectives in life counting on his/her values scale; Therefore, some people will fight for an employ, others for a family, an independency,..., and a few will have to give up certain desires in order to get on with other needs.
Like I said at the beginning of the essay, my point of view in relation to the presence of equality in the community seems impossible since plurality is an essential phenomenon in order to survive and make progress. I am convinced that the disparity and the variaty force anybody to get engaged in improvement, as well as I believe that without respect to persons life would be burned out, without upward movement.
To finish, just conclude that in some ways inequality goes against nature, but on the other hand, allows the community to make progress.

SPM04042,3.0,3.5,,,,,"In his novel ""Animal Farm"" George Orwell wrote ""All men are equal but some are more equal than others"". How true is this today?","
Well, we can stay that today we are more equal than in other centuries, but it's also true that there are still a lot of discriminations. These discriminations are united to the same people than in the past, these are black people, women, poor people and minorities. This discrimination, if we read the human rights declaration, should not exist. It says that we are all equal and that our religion, sex or colour are not a reason to discriminate anybody.
We are going to see now the different discriminations. First, we will see the colour discrimination. This has been one of the most important discrimination. In the United States, long time ago, the racism caused a civil war. Americans thought that black people were born to be slaves and that they haven't got rights. They bought them like if they were horses or pigs or ducks and maybe they cared better their animals than the black people.
Nowadays, this problem is still present in the United States, well, they are not slaves but many people don't like that the black people work with them, and live near them.
Some policeman kick them and bring them to prision only because they are black.
In Europe there is also racism, we don't have to go so far to see it. Right here, in Spain, there are groups of people who belong to a tribe called Skin-heads. This people, from my point of view, are young men and women who have not got their own ideas so they adopt Hitler's ideas.
Second, we are going to talk about the sex discrimination. During a lont time, woman was discriminate for the man, they saw her like an object which is used to clean the house, coocking, bring the children to school, etc... Till the end of the Second World war, women couldn't vote in England, for example, in Spain it was so late. Now, woman can vote but this does not mean that there's no discrimination. There are still men who think the women are in a lower scale. Women have shown that they are as competent as men but in a lot of works they still deny women's asks to work in their enterprises.
Another sex group which is discriminate, is the homosexual group. People think that the relationship between too men or two women is unnatural. But I think that if nature made them homosexual, their relationships are very natural. That people think this, makes that homosexuals don't say that they are it, this caused that a lot of homosexuals marry with a heterosexual, they lie to his couple and all finish in divorce.
The last reason of discrimination is the religion, this has caused a lot of pugnants. At the middle of the century, a crazy man, Hitler, order to kill the judaist people because they belong to the tribe who killed Jesus Christi. But, at the end of this century, in our days, it has started another war in the old Yugoslavia. It was a war against the musulmans who live there. They had been living together for a long time and suddenly people start to hate them.
After having seen this, we can say that although we don't like, we are all a bit racist, and we only can hope that this change some day.

Some people say that in our modern world, dominated by science, technology and industrialization, there is no longer a place for dreaming and imagination. What is your opinion?. I can only say that this statement is completely true. I agree with this so much that I could not avoid choosing this topic. I am at a working with computers or other kinds of ""modern technology"". Well, maybe it is just that I am not really interested in learning much about it. Technology is the future and I recognize this. I know that, in the end, I will have to learn just like everyone else.
Technology has gone so far that the question is: Where does the man end and where does the machine start?. I do not want to be pessimistic, but progress is transforming us into machines. Nowadays, we do not think for ourselves. Everything is already done for us. It used to be that it was our brains that did the work. People used their imagination trying to explain misteries without visible solutions. Now, it seems like people have become tired of doing so much work in a day with only 24 hours. One of the principal roots of the problem is time. People felt that they did not have enough time so they invented computers to help them out. However, despite the additional help of the computers, people feel as pressed for time as ever. It seems that we spend so much time trying to get the computer to do what we tell it to that it would be easier if we just did the work ourselves. It is a long time since there has been no room for dreaming and imagination in society, and, in 1996, still less.
Can we imagine a world without computers or without advanced technology?. Could people survive?. Personally, I think that I could. Just imagine for a minute that we have gone back to the 17th century. It is the century in which the first novels were published. People dreamt about them and they imagined fantastic vorlds where they were the heroes and the heroines of stories of wonder. They knew nothing about computers and I am sure that they were as happy as we are. I am not saying that industrialization is necessarily a bad thing. On the contrary!. The question is finding the balance between the time we spend dreaming, and say the time we spend enjoying some computer game.
Another subject that I think is important is the relationship between children and technology. When I was a child, I used to read short stories or watching cartoons. I was happy. Nowadays, children depend on television more than my generation did. They do not watc wholesome shows like Sesame Street anymore; instead, they watch shows based on violence like Power Rangers. They do not have time for dreaming because they are always in front of the television or playing with the Game Boy. Maybe this is their way of dreaming but everything that comes to their eyes is violence. The computer games are about fighting or race cars... Children like these games because they are the most entertaining. Does technology and progress promote competition between children?. Maybe it does but I think it would be a sad way to encourage competition. If the younger generations do not know anything about dreaming, how can we blame them?. They have not been taught by their parents but my machines. I believe that with the passage of the time, we will be dominated more and more by the very machines we thought would be of help.
To conclude I have to say that when I hear the words ""dreaming"" and ""imagination"", I think of books, of films, of all those fantastic realities that still survive. Of course there is still a place for these things in our everyday life. What we have to do is to be careful not to let computers gain ground.

SPM04047,3.5,3.0,,,,,"In the words of the old song: ""Money is the root of all evil""","
We are all aware that in the 20th century our life and human condition influenced by an Occidental structure, are built on the columns of money. It is believed that we live together within a linguistics, social, politics and religious community, but all these kinds of relationships really stay revolted in favour of a great economic community. This, regulating transactions between human lifes like marionettes of a great ironic spectacle, annuls our human condition changuing us into hyperbolic money-making machines.
It is a paradox to say that the man is enoughly individual, rational, and independent to fight for a ideals that allow himm to value himself and adhere to his free thought, he isn't able to create nothing more than the economic ideal. This idea ""metamorphoses"" a idealist existence whose dream is to live accordint to his possibilities and beliefs into a materialist one who always dreams of living according his pocket, even forgetting who is. This losing of identy is what corroborates that the words of the old song ""money is the root of all evil"" are quite truth. This effect causes in the man a need of common sense that prevents himm from being free for living, doing, speaking and thinking. Action, Thought, communication and feeling stay covered by the metalic vile spreading harme in the heart; by this, in my opinion, human life is good for Nature, but nowdays, this materialis society is what corrupts him.
Man neither acts, nor loves, nor speaks, no thinks freely according his wishes. Fromm the beginning of our lifes, we life conditioned by the economic status to whiche we belong. Even before having born within an Occidental culture, human life innately collects all his principles and creates his own materialist structure. From the beginning until the end of our lifes we are collectint the fruits of our personal efforst whose root is money producing our economic goods: Thus, we get our culture, our education, our work, our welfare state, our language and even our feelings, and thoughts, no for ourselves, but fpr pir economy. It doesn't matter to the society what we are but how muche money we have. This is the cause of a world which hasn't solidarity due to money doesn't make equal people but very differrent having provoked injustices and inequalities during a lot of years: though all people should be equal, money separates and open for us different ways toward the sucess or the downfall.
The inequlities, the injustices and inuman acts tha cause money are so powerful that it is thought of the inesistence of solidarity and humankind. This economic society is relationed by interestand even pure feelings like the friendship satys subvalued because only thtee is economy disguised beneath the appeareance of friendship; thus, for instance, the affective words betwen the friends saty reduced by economy of the language.
Human life perfectly knows that money make him more harm than good. He thinks that conditions him and lowrs and forbids his person. But also he knows that without mone nobody is able to live: it is the motor that urges on the movements of the Human Nature. He also understand that he must get a godd economic state due to the progress of the 20th century; progress means having a lot of money in order to become ""somebody"" and otherwise if we dont progress, we fal suddenly toward the loam where we are footed by our superiors: actually being poor is being nothing.
To finisht with this unpleasant rose i have given to the indispensable and rulung need that money has within our society and culture, i would like to proclaim the idea that we live together within a society that that it hasn't money, without being conditione more than by our person, breaking the traditional economic mouls. But i must add that this is an utopic idea, so unpleasantly money is a reality, realiy neccesarily indispensably within our Occidentally civilized world. At his pont y must quote a literary precedent referred to this utopy: Daniel Defoe's Robison Crusoe. In this novel of the 18th century it is narrated the adventures happened to an Englishman that was shipwrecked toward a desert island escaping from the civilized world. He is the first modern Englishman, qualified as ""homus economicus"". He is characterized because without mone (though he has a lot, is really useless for his new life), get to build his own enterprise due the search of the armony with the Nature and to his primitive order. The mos important of this novel is the meditations about the sate in which he is. He tells that he is happier living in this island and believing in his own forces and ideals than in England where he had everything, but he always wanted more and more money for getting his wishes saving the complete happyness. This literaru play corroborates the idea that mone is the root of all evil and that the complete happyness of the human live would be an idealist societ there mone was a null paper. But it is very sad to think of our happyness as an utopy.

SPM04048,3.0,2.5,,,,,"In the words of the old song: ""Money is the root of all evil""","
From the beggining of the society there are the problem of the money. All the people wants to be richer than his neighbour. People accept jobs according to how many they pay him but not according to his preferences. People tends to think that the more important is the money but they tell you that it is the health.
Money is the real problem of the society in this world, because it determines the great real problem in the society nowadays: the avarice. But it is not a problem that only appears now, but it is a problem who begins since the man is a man. When the man thought like an animal, he still have the instinct of survice, with no matters if other person lived better than him. He changed his elephant peel for a hen, without thinking if, maybe, the the peel could have more value than the hen. He thought: ""I needs this hen in order to survive, and, as I don't need this elephant peel I could change it"". But, in a indeterminated moment of the history of the human beings -it would be interesting that the cameras had record this moment-, one man said ""my peel is most value than your hen, if you want me to give you this peel, you will have to give me two of your hens"" -even knowing that it would be worse for the three children of the man. This poor man accept the change, and from this moment begins the avarice. This fact could make us thing that the real guilty of the beginning of the greed was... the man who accepted the first avaricious treat, but it would be accept that all the humanity is guilty and... it's so true.
It's so true because only a very rather small group of people has denied to following the rule of the greeds. And we can see it along the history of the humanity, and it is the reason why we following with the rough history of the world.
The people who begin to restore the avarice in the world sow that the best vehicle to keep that has born: the money. We can think that the reason of the creation of the money was good, in order to value the things you need and to prevent people to buy things according to its prize, but as the good ideas uses to finish in bad results, as we can see with the invention of the powder, the result is a invention, that instead of help society, damage it.
People left his desires and became to work in those work where they can buy more money. This wasn't very dangerous if some people doesn't follow this parameters, but the 99% of the population of the world begin to believe to this way of live ""less pleasure and more money"". This situation produces that people who coudn't earn the same money as their neighbours, get greed, and even they would not tell you nothing about it, they didn't mind if their neighbours didn't earn so much money.
But this fact doesn't finish here, because people, when they have a relevant and important work, they treats to better their entrances making ""dark business"". This phenomenon is relevant nowadays, as we can see in countries as Spain, Itally, EE.UU. or Great Britain, where politics, don't agree of what they want, prefer to put in dangerous his liberty in order to buy a luxury apartment with two hundred bathrooms. Then people thinks: ""if the politics, who had teorically to be honest, because they represent the whole country, they don't, then, why I cant do it!"". Then, people begins to declare to the government less than they really earns, and the snow ball begins to be more and more big.
Children will born in this state of greed, and from the beginning, they will prefer the money instead of the love of his family and this will produce a lost of the old values, than, even when we thinks that this values don't help us and it would have to be changed by new values, they help us to keep a bit of humanity in our souls.
If this ball keeps its rhythm, we will return back to the wilderness, because wars will be more frequent than nowadays, and we will live as animals, with only a diference, animals never hurts animals of his own blood.

Including the word ""men"" both terms, men and women, it must be said that they are equal in law. Nevertheless, there are two kinds of laws: National laws and a group of laws created by a group of nations with the main purpose of stablishing universal rights. An example of the first kind of laws, those which are part of a Cnstitution, written constitution or non written. And the other type of laws, those which have been made by organizations as the ONU which includes a big number of other societies as UNICEF; UNESCO etc.
Having made this short introduction, few problems arise in the same moment in which law is put into practice. I will attempt to make a division which has something in common with that in the introduction: 	1. Equality of rights in a national way, taking as reference differences between men and women in England.
2. Equality of rights, comparing people with social possibilities and people who lack those possibilities.
Before I expose those problems, I must say the election has been England not for a paritcular reason, because the British situation about the next problem is very similar over the world. That is, in Britain a big different treatment is given for men and women. Statistics show it in a clear way: The wage per hour for a man is 8.07 pounds, While for a woman is 6.40 pounds. Another interesting point to emphasize is that men have better jobs than women. An example to illustrate this idea is that the 98% of the lectures at British university are men, so that if they have better jobs they have better pay. More differences between men and women are given in other fields of society, but I have taken labour field because it is one of the most representative.
The other division which I have made, is refering to an universal problem. The contrast between people with social possibilities and people without social possibilities. A hundred years ago, one of the most important organization in the world, concerning with human rights was founded.The ONU (Organizarion of United Nations) claims that all men and women are equal, that is, they have the same rights. As in the other example happened, that claim has nothing to do with reality. A middle class person has three basic necessities, plus another which is non less important: A place for living, clothing, food and education. Taking account these four necessities are universal rights, they must be given to every one by law. It must be said that observing the reality this is only a pipe dream the situation reaches such extent, that one child per second dies in the world. And this fact is not taken as important when a law is written.
With all in all, I can conclude that: ""All men and all women are equal: but some are more equal than others.""

The aim of this paper is to discuss whether the prison sy system is outdated and what should a civilised society do with its criminals to rehabilitate them . Does prison system rehabilitate indeed ? What are convicts situation within the prison like ? Is there a real alternative to rehabilitate criminals ? Why does public opinion show no interest at all in this subject ? In my opinion it is quite clear that there must be found new means to deal with such a serious problem .
According to researchs , studies , and statistics , most of the criminals are not rehabilitated by means of prison system , since during their time in prison , they are isolated from the rest of the world and society . Logically , that is not the best way of rehabilitating criminals for the society , by isolating him or her . Nevertheless , when criminals are released , they find themselves even more isolated than they were before . The isolation is due to people behaviour to them ; they are notsupported but rejected . Once they get out of prison , they find it difficult to integrate into society again so they have agreat deal of problems such as getting a job , and so on . Some former convicts' testimonies say that they do not feel very confident , and confortable when joining the society again . That is way the only solution for many of them is crime , breaking the law; thus probably , getting back to prison .
Everybody knows that a great majority among imprisoned people are drugs addicted and some of them being seriously sick , even infected with AIDS . Some of this sick people are there because of their addiction . In many places they do not have appropiate medical care . There are differences between people imprisoned in the so-called third world , and those in the developed countries . Although , that should not be a reason to support prison system whereever it were . Those people imprisoned in the underdeveloped world , are living under subhuman conditions ; thousands of people piles up , struggling with hunger and without health guarantees al all . Besides this , in these places human rights are not taken into account .
It is obvious , there is no interest , neither authorities nor on citizens part , in solving this question or in presenting it to public opinion . So , we have got to wonder what is the reason for it . I suppose , the reason could be that neither conservative nor liberal people are interested in having criminals wandering around , thus being a threat for society . The society would be more confident having criminnals in a safe place , therefore , there would be no risk for anybody . I am sure, a great majority agree with the idea that prison is the best place for criminals to be and that there would be no better place for those breaking the law . Evenmore in some places still exist popularly supported death penalty. It is obvious that in in that places there is the thought that the prison system is outdated; ; since , those nations get rid of its criminals . So the conlusion is : the more criminals staying imprisoned , the better for the society . There is the feeling that once crimminnals have infringed law , they do not belong to society anymore . According to this toughts, politicians do not include the prison system question in their electioneering , at least including progressists proposals . Supporting such ideas is unpopular and would not be good for their images . Even , most of them may think there is no need to change prison system .
As far as I am concerned , there are not many proposals saying how rehabilitate criminals abolishing prison system . The proposals held , such as , engaging those infringing law in social works , are not accepted , indeed . In spite of it , we should continue supporting that imprisonment is not the right way of facing this problem . As we have seen , the solutions is quite difficult to find , evenmore when nobody looks for it. Maybe we should wonder what is going wrong with our society , when it produces people having to survive by any means necessary , even outside the law .

In the twentieth century,scientific advances have contributed to the modification in daily life.Names like Freud or Einstein have managed to broadnew horizons for universe comprehension.This continuous progress has been stimulated by constant armed conflicts, and so many important discoveries are related with military technology.Science is not only luxury but is part of human life.Most of important enterprises have at their disposal a team of investigators.Nowadays,our life is riddled of machines which entail an advanced technology:televisions,cars,cameras and a large list.
Some of the advances which have influenced in modern life are space conquest,genetics -Darwin and Mendel have contributed to great advances in the field-,but above all in medicine,with new discoveries tahnks to the psichoanalysis and important advances in mortal diseases like cancer and AIDS. It has to be mencioned advances in transplants of vital organs which has saved many lifes.
Classical wise men has made way for the complexity in modern science. But,how did greeks manage to survive without all these technical things?, it is obvious that they had to use their heads.If they wanted to go to somewhere,they cannot use a car nor bus,and if war broke out they cannot use tanks nor missiles,but despite all these lacks they formed a great empire.
Nevertheless,for checking the importance of the imagination we can read 'Robinson Crusoe', and after seeing how he survive alone in a desert island, only with his mind ,we will appreciate our imagination.He build himself his own home,he manages to get food in an unforeseen way,and thus living there more than twenty years.
Twentieth - century-man,in the other hand,is used to live with comfort, perhaps this is the causae by which we do not need to do it.Technology provide us with all we need.What is obvious is taht everybody has imagination and can use it,but since it is not neccesary,we prefer this situation.
My opinion is that although technology indisputably very,very important in our life, is something relatively delicate.I mean it can fail but our mind,our imagination,our dreams do not fail,they are somethng ours and may vary depending on the person. nd so,it offers us many possibilities,as many as people live all over the world.In a few words,the most important thing is not to forget that our imagination and our mid are neccesary to obtain technology but technology is not neccesary to have imagination.

The social rehabilitation of criminals and convicts, as an issue, came recently up in the society whether we tought that the nature of this conception has its early roots in the second half of the nineteenth century 		Nowadays, the social rehabilitation is a concept or notion made by the juridical science, particularily by the Criminal Policy and its application to the penitenciary method.

It is only natural to think that in this period of changes nad discoveries, the juridical science would change to a new system.
The fist step toward this new system centred on social rehabilitation appeared in the medicine field. In this way, came up tendencies which thought that criminals and murderers operated like this because they had this condition somewhere in their brains. The solution for this question was centred on correcting their conduct and trying to guide them to the society, and all that it involves.
The second step is based on the acceptance by european countries of Liberal Constitutions, where fundamental rights are recognized.
Finally with the advance of the twenty's century and after the Second World War,a social policy began to beeing practice in all Justice States. This sociala policy guaranteeded the right's preformace recognized on their Constitutions. An example is the Treaty of Rome, signed in 1950 and The Convention Of Ginebra, which collect rights of prisoners and refugees.
Thanks to these conventions and studies made around this issue, nowadays,rights of these people who are carrying out punishment are respected, although this question don't guarantee their posterior social rehabilitation once they had finished their punishment. The Criminal Policy together with lawyers and sociologists are those who try to guarantee the named social rehabilitation.
In this way, we bring over the present time, in which the finality of the exclusive punishment of freedom is to get the reabilitation of the person who suffer it.In order that, in prisons are followed penitentiary plans with the Goverment's help and other institutions both publics and privates.
The criminal has the posibility of learning a trade by meansa of employment programs, in order that they could have a range of posibilities when they have to face again to the society.
The problems that we can find are two: on the one hand, the overcrowding of the prisons that makes difficult, to a great exent, the aplication of these plansa of rehabilitation.
On the other hand, the repulse taht they have to suffer on part of the society, which thought that the social rehabilitation involves forgetting unpunished a criminal fact.
Finally, we have to take into account that hte social rehabilitation is a complex and hard issue,but it is consequence of the human evolution.

SPM05017,3.5,2.5,,,,,Feminists have done more harm to the cause of women than good,"
Bearing in mind that sex equality is one of the great reason for fights in most places around the world, people still wonder if Feminist have done more harm to the cause of women than good. For the present, this conflict has not been resolve yet because of several factors. Despite equality may be achieved, it needs a great effort from all us and it is, already, very difficult to attain.
According to most dictionaries feminism is defined as ""the felief in the principle that women should have the same rights and legal (regularity of civil rights with men), political (right to vote and to be voted), economic (right to apply for any post and to be remunerated by it like a men) or even social equality"" and ""movement to defend women rights and to avoid male abuses"".
Feminism is a movement which appeared during the 18th. century; therefore, it became more and more usual in the 19th. century. After the First World War, rights of both sexs were recognised in some countries. A notable radicalism arose in Western countries in the sixties. Some examples were Mouvement pour la Liberation de la Femme, in France, and Young Socialist Alliance, in the U.S. One of the most modern demonstration of this attitude was the holding of the Women's Liberation Movement has suggested alterations in the stories which are read to children. Feminist womankind ask for brave princesses to rescue helpless ""blue"" princes occasionaly.
The concept feminism is a discriminatory term by itself, whose idealistic purpose implies a claim of superiority of the so-called ""gentle sex"". In spite of the fact that feminist must take over physiological distinctions between women and men, human intelligence must not be related to physical strength. On no account scientific findings imply any kind of improvement in human behaviour, although they used to stimulate the growing of a capitalist society. The pejorative idea of feminism encourages to the acquisition of a male chauvinist attitude, which has a tendency towards sexual discrimination in several fields, such as work, science or even everyday life.
In fact, people who believe that men are biologically stronger than women (or at least as strong as them) insist on defending that women live longer because men work harder and are exposed to more stress and danger in their jobs. This idea can be refuted by looking at death rate statistics. Even though, the number of female and male births are rooughly the same (slightly more females), more males die in every age group, form fetus to ninety years old. Considered together, life expentancy rates and death rates strongly suggest that women are biologically ""stronger"" than men.
Elsewhere, human beings have constructed a male chauvinist society, in which social roles are distributed according to moral and traditional ancestral customs. Male Chauvinism is defined as ""an excessive or blind patriotism or devotion to a group to which one belongs"". While women's essential role is staying at home and taking care of children's education, men's duty is working out and feeding his family. Otherwise, women refrain from changing her sons's education, which focuses on an utterly male point of view and which does rarely offer any chance for women. Even if men try to assume feminine tasks are named ""milkshops"". In this case, equality is interpreted as a sort of public humiliation.
Some negatives aspects which feminism tries to avoid are exposed below. Marriage often means a lose of women's rights, because the head is the man and even children acquire their father's surnamen. However, nowadays, the possibility of changing the order of surnames is offered by law, thus, a person can reverse his or her surnames provided that they are 18 years old. Moreover, some women lead their principal aims to marriage, in order to be feeding by their ""upper"" husband for life. They have no goals in their life, and their freedom is completely cut down by whole dependence.
As a conclusion, feminism can be taken as radical nonsense movement by those who are educated under strict male rules; nevertheless, it must represent a call for freedom and a whole claiming against frequent male abuses and discrimination because of sex. This movement may be too radical but life is determined by the law of nature, which defends survival of the fittest, despite her or his sex. Consequently, feminism can cause occasionally more harm to their cause than good, but their task is essential to lead us to a nearly equal society or, at least, a more tolerant social behaviour.

SPM05020,3.0,2.5,,,,,Most university degrees are theoretical and do not prepare students for the real world. They are therefore of very little value,"
From the past to nowdays young people have been educated and mentaliced to decide to go to University, which is good for the level of intelectuallity of the country and for one self improvement. But what is going to be discussed here is that in our country we have an educational system at the level of University on which we do not get the preparation to go out and have a gob. With this I am not saying that it is not good enough, only that I think it is not well organiced.
To speak under my own experience, since I am a university student in my second year of career. The fist year, althoug was not bad, it was still not clear to me, but waiting to see my second year (since the first is always a little hard because of the change from school to University) I feel that this year I am in a worst point of view.
Fist of all, my situation about classes and subjects is that I find most of them worthwhile, though there are some other which are totally unworthy, what I mean is that I do not see the importance to study them for my purpose in a future, so I do not understand why I hvae to spend one or two years studying one them while that subject is taken only once, I mean it is not needed for the rest of the career. At the same time, there are some academic teachers who are not competent to their work.
So besides what I have been talking above, I think that do not come to University and LEARN, which would be the main point of this. Going to University is in a few words having a good time, learning by memorizing right before the exams (knowledge which is forgoten a few days after), and having a good life, ' the easy life of the student ', which is totally true, because the years past by, people end the carreer between five to eight years ( which I think is a long time to do nothing ), and then ready to prepare the degree, master on that, year abroad to specialize the foreing language, and then ready to work. After all this is done, a whole life of young fellow is half past, and getting out to this world to fgind a job, nowdays is pretty much difficult; what I have to point out that spychologicly that is another point against us since after all this time of 'preparing' and working on ones future, there is no job.
Refereing myself again to what I said above about staying a long time with out doing something but studying, is that this educational system is not organiced to permit the student his/her independence, I mean that it is not equivalent to work and study at hte same time since the classes squedual is spread during all day and does not permit the student to work, and as I can see each year is harder to do it, which I think is not fair.
So we come to the conclusion that a lot of students can not resist all this lose of time and they just get out of University before finising, to find their future on their own, others try to stay because the laboral situation is even worst without a career, and others decide to study for state jobs, which is very hard but at least if the exam is passed the job is for sure, and once inside there is the possibility to learn (practically) the job and get a promotion.
This is much my point of view about University and its degrees which I think nowadays are very little value, though there is a possibility on which I can change my mind about this in a future and could be happy with what I am doing, and hopefully I would finish my carrer and with luch find a good job. Who knows what is waiting out there for us...

SPM07005,2.0,2.0,2.0,1.5,2.5,1.5,Most university degrees are theoretical and do not prepare students for the real world. They are therefore of very little value,"
In our society, an university degree is becoming more and more important each day as it is very difficult to find a job, especially for young people.
You are asked for an university degree in many jobs, even though this has nothing to do with the work you must carry out.
This is the mean reason, I think, because of people, nowadays, want to take an university degree.
The problem is that most university degrees are theoretical and do not prepare students for the real world. In most of cases, when you start in a new job, you are lost because although you have a good formation, this is a theoretical formation and probably will not be as useful as it should be. What most of firms do is to impart the courses that are needed in a particular job.
I think that people should be formed in a more practical way when they are studing at university, so they can put into practice what they have learned in their theoretical lessons. In my opinion, this is one of the better ways of learning.
However, in our educational system, this is very difficult because one of its greatest problems is the lack of money, and money is essential as it is necessary for the manteinance and improvement of the laboratories, the informatic rooms, etc, and for everything that is needed for a good practical formation at the university; and to realize another practical tasks outside the university (in a firm, in a museum, in a factory or in anywhere).
This is the reason because many people have to complete their education, after having finished university, with complementary courses or masters in relation with the career they have studied which, in the most of cases are not free, and eve many of them are so expensive that only a few people can study them. This makes that not everyone has the same oportunities when they are looking for a job, because if you have a master or a prestigious course in your curriculum vitae, you have more posibilities to be employed that if you don't.
In spite of all these reasons showed, I don`t think that university degrees are of very little value, because they are very useful as a good formation.
""University is the school of life"". As this saying, I think that, in some way, university is the school of life, although this should be applied to the university of some years ago, when it was more difficult to take an university degree because parents could not afford to send their children to study at university.
Nowadays university is not the school of life in the same way as it was a time before, because it has become a school where many people study to pass and to take an university degree, and only a little minority studies to learn, to acquire a solid formation and to prepare to real world.
I would like to say to conclude that, in my opinion, university degrees are of a great value as an academic degree and also as an important advantage when you are looking for a job, because, in most of cases, you will find it before than you have not an university degree.

SPM07006,4.0,2.5,,,,,All armies should consist entirely of professional soldiers: there is no value in a system of military service,"
Nowadays there is a debate about the convenience of having a professional army instead of the compulsory military service. The Parliament is discussing this problem and trying to reach a majority accord.
There is a political sector which are in favour of the professional army. They think this is the most convenient solution for an old problem. Since some years ago, there has been an increasing in the number of people who are against the compulsory military service. This problem has become one of the most important for young men in Spain who think that doing this service is only a waist of time, time that they could use to study, to work or some other things more useful than the military service.
People who has finished the compulsory military service think that thy have lost one year (now 9 months), doing anything apart from a lot of gymnastic, and working as waiters, drivers or other things for the Army. One of the things most of them claimed for was that they were doing a lot of works just earning around 1000 pesetas per month.
The solution according the majority of the people asked is that Spain should have a professional army, like there is in other countries ,for example in the United States of America.
This new army would be a real army, with people who has been preparing themselves for this. Actually, doing the militar studies is a solution for many young people ,not only men, to get a job in the forthcoming future and in most cases doing what they like. This project will reduce the cost of the army for the government, and they could use this remaining money for many things including giving a better training to professional soldiers. At this moment there a lot of professional soldiers working for the army, mostly in the most important places of the army, like can be all the officials, most of the subofficials and not only a few soldiers. This professional soldiers earn around 120,000 pesetas per month or more, so is not a very bad payment, and in the next future if the army becomes enterely professional it's possible that this number increases.
As an example of how can improve the training of the soldiers if they are professionals instead of replacement soldiers is enough with the experience of the Spanish Legion. In a recent militar handiwork of the OTAN, the Spanish army had to ""fight"" against the north American army ,known as one of the most powerful and well-trained of the world. One night, during this handiwork the soldiers of the Legion entered in the American campament an stole all the boots to the American soldiers, the next morning when this American soldiers wanted get dressed they found the had lost their boots and where incapable of moving which was the reason why the Spanish Army won the ""war"".
To summarize getting a professional army would be a good solution for the people, in one hand the people who dislikes these things (guns,uniforms,discipline,...) would get free from doing it, on the other hand people who like this life and wants to have a sure job will have it, in better conditions that there are nowadays. But at the end the decision will be from the government, as most things in all the civilizated countries.

SPM07017,3.0,3.0,2.5,4.0,3.0,,"Some people say that in our modern world, dominated by science and technology and industrialisation, there is no longer a place for dreaming and imagination. What is your opinion?","
It's well know that out modern world is dominated by science, technology and industrialisation.
Nowadays in our societies there are lot of kinds of people, I mean, people from all ages. And here es where we can notice the effects of the progress on the imagination capacity of the population in our world, specially at early ages.
Old people doesn't spend time in dreaming but in remembering their lives, when they are children, youngers or even when they were middle-aged people. That's when the elder population used to imagine other situation, other life. That were moments of wars, disaster, poverty and the science technology was in an investigation step. Television didn't exist.
Middle-aged people are still thinking about new changes but they know that it's very dificult to break with all their habits. In their childhood, television started to work but it was too much expensive to get a t.v. set for most of the families and these children grew without this monster of the telecomunication.
People in their late twenties or thirties try to combine the reality and the fantasy. They are enough young to dream and enough old to realice on what's on their hands. At their early ages, television was lead by the people who had just discovered this powerful mass-media and at those moments most of the programs were still interesting.
About the young people and children, there are two kinds of them, those who are not very influenced by television and those who are.
The former are problably the people with the biggest capacity of dreaming and inventing of this population. There's no doubt they can based their original ideas in something they have seen before, for instance, in television but they have their brains in a continous development.
The latter have their minds completely atrophied and this can't permit fly their imagination, they only can think about the fights, wars, bombs, sex, and similar things that they watch in the telly. We can argue that television have interesting programs for educate children too, and that's true. But the problem is that our younger people spend hours and hours in front of the t.v. set watching films and scenes less recomended for them. This is one of the causes of the rising figures of violence in our societies all around the world.
In my opinion the key to solve this problem is the base, in the basic education at schools and over all, in the upbringing at homes. Alternatives to this waste of time, are sports, reading, relationship with other people, and so on.

SPM10002,3.5,3.5,,,,,"In his novel ""Animal Farm"" George Orwell wrote ""All men are equal but some are more equal than others"". How true is this today?","
I consider that the idea behind the sentence quoted above is still true in our time. We only have to take a look to the newspapers or listen to the radio and television to realise that there are still people committing crimes against other people's integrity. In order to support my opinion, I would mention two cases in which this situation takes place: Firstable the way in which women live in certain countries and secondly the racism still existing in our Occidental societies.
In countries like India, Morocco and others from South Africa, women are still considered of the same value (or even less) than a piece of cattle. In many agricultural villages of India, the future of girl child is to work in order to pay her brothers education and to save enough money to offer a good dowry. So, the situation shows how in this country a woman has not identity, she is a quantity that a man may or may not acquire. In some countries in South Africa men have the legal right of marring a girl child (providing that she is already in a fertile age: 12 or 14 years old) if their families would benefit from that union. As a result of those marriages the health of the girls is put in danger mainly because they get pregnant before their bodies are completelly formed, therefore when these girls give birth they risk their lives. A common thing that occurs to these young mothers, if they do not die during the birth, is the breaking of some filaments in the vagina producing urine escapes. Many of these girls are rejected by their husbands because of that problem, this leads them to be rejected by their society and as a consequence they occupy the lowest social scale, they are like abandoned animals that have to live from the charity of others.
The facts just mentioned are only few instances of those places where, at the doors of the 21st Century, men feel 'more equal' than women. Societies where just for being male you have more advantages and where the right of women for being ?equal? is not taken into consideration.
The racist actions against immigrants in countries like Spain could be only explained by saying that some people feel themselves 'more equal than others'. In a society like ours, I think that it is unacceptable that a minority of people goes by the streets threatening and hurting those people that some day had to leave their countries just to find a better way of survival. That minority (but still a quite big group) tries to explain its cruel acts arguing among other things that that person from Africa, South America or East Europe is occupying a work post that should correspond to a Spanish person. Maintaining the Spanish culture and race as pure as possible is another reason that they give to explain their barbarous actions. Their argumentation, in my opinion, is very weak; firstable because immigrants usually work in jobs that Spanish do not want recieving a mimimum amount of money. Secondly, the idea of having a pure Spanish culture is a paradox because our culture in itself is the result of a mixture of other cultures like for instance: the Roman, Arabic, Jewish and French. Though inexplicable, this is another case that exemplifies that in our modern time equality among men is not true yet.
I would like to say that though in our time the idea of 'some being more equal that others'is still true, the present situation is better than what it could be in Orwells time. This is possible thanks to the existence of organizations like that of Humans Wrights, Women Wrights, Children Wrights, etc. However, the fact that the situation is not as bad as before does not mean that it is good, there are still many things to improve and many minds to change.
As I reaching to the end of this paper I would like to finish by asking if there would be a time where the sentence 'All men are equal: but some are more equal than others' would not be true.

SPM10006,2.0,1.5,,,,,Most university degrees are theoretical and do not prepare students for the real world. They are therefore of very little value,"
In the past, it is true that those people who had university studies could get a good job easily, mainly because there were not many people in the University due to economic reasons. Another important aspect is that there was not such a variety of studies and almost everybody became teacher, doctor, lawyer,... no matter if the degrees were based on theory. So, it was more a question of prestige.
Nowadays, finding a job is not that casy and lt is becoming more and more difficult even if you have recelved an universlty education. One of the causes of this problem could be the way university degrees are structured.
lt is supposed that university degrees should he geared to professional future. Since many of those degrees have several openings, in my opinion, there should exist a practical specialization for each of these openings and therefore, students would finish knowing what they will have to do when they find a job. lt is obvious that to get this aim, the syllabus should be checked and corrected, or even, rewritten.
The ideal way of studying could be giving just the necessary theoretical keys so as to be able to apply them in practical situations, the more similar to reality, the better. For instance, in the case of language university studies, the syllabus should include, at least, one subject on that language per year, since languages are changing all the time and besides, by not practising it, students forget basically, vocabulary and expressions.
As far as my personal experience as an university student is concerned, I find necessary to have a deep look into the whole syllabus in order not to repeat any subjects, to reduce the number of them, to organize them in a way that the study of them is logical, whether it is chronological or simply a question of sense and, of course, to include a number of hours dedicated to practice.
For instance, lt is the case of that student of Chemistry who has never been to a laboratory. He/she may know all the formula and theoretic explanations, but, when dealing with a real experiment or investigation project, reallze that he or she is not sure of which formula to apply. Or the situation of someone studying journalism who has never been, for example, to a radio programme.
lt is true that some degrees also consist of practical training in enterprises, schools, hospitals or wherever, as long as it is related to the studies, but there are many more which are just theoretical. The trouble is very serious because when you flnlsh your studies and have to 'face up to the world', you realize that the first thing you are asked in an application for a job is lf you have worked in that field before. Of course, if you are in your early twenties, lt is very probable that you have never had an employment. However, all those people who have had practical training after their studies can say they have experience or even have the possibility of keeping on working in that enterprise where they took their practical lessons.
Recently, there are the so-called 'Mdulos', which are more concrete and aimed at a specific professional opening. From my point of view, they are quite well structured, since they are about two years long and you do not obtain your title unless you fulfil a certain number of hours of practical training in real entreprises and dealing with cases of the real life.
As a conclusion, I would like to say that nowadays, to have an university degree is not a question of prestige but, practically, a need, since when looking for an employment, you are required as many titles as possible. Thus, the ordeno of the studies should be better established so that the title would correspond exactly to our level of knowledge, and ths includes practical knowledge.
(NOTE: Although I do not agree very much with the syllabus of rny studies, I want to say that I like what I am doing.)

""A year full of opportunities, a time of personal grotwth?
That is how the new course is presented every single year since my universlty studies began nearly five years ago.
However, I ask to myself. how long is it true?
Among all the topics suggested, a very interesting and close to young people one stand out: the real value of university degree and how students are prepared in order to be successful in life.
In fact, it is quite controversial.
What it should be remarked is that one receives that kind of preparation in everyday life, not in universities or colleges.
In this essay, I am not looking for such a thorny matter but a similar one: the application of theoretical knowledge in universities, in case they are applied.
Let's go for it.
Our teachers, headmasters, parents, and so on, inculcase us careers are the top-most point of all our academic training.
All the things you have been learning for years will reach a point in which they begin to mnake sense.
You have grown up, matured, and you are supposed (more or less) to know what you want in life.
Following these principles, one chooses a career in which ?t is expected to learn as many things as possible in order to be a good professional in your job or, maybe, just to get a degree useful in life.
Up to here, that is thought when starting a career.
The same happens when you are close to end up your studies at university.
But, what have you really learnt during all those years?
Apart from playing cards, ""mus"" if you are a real and genuine Spanish student, minds are full of data expecting to be put into practice. Many of them wl be so done, especially those belonging to one's special field, in our specifc case, English literature or linguistics. But, what about that paragraph in the second unit learnt in X subject three years ago? Does anybody remember it? It should be.
However, it is most probable that a personal experience, referring to our teachers or friends (it does not matter), will be remembered in a much better way.
Two considerations must be done: theoretical lessons are necessary obviously, but also, we are lacking a putting into effect.
First, it is kown by all of us that a non-theoretical way of learning is rather difficult to find (if not impossible).
That is no the matter we are dealing with, or unless, not directly.
On the other hand, it should be consider that most of the times, that theoretical knowledge are not brought into practice; as a consequence, they are usuauy forgotten.
Let's face it; to deny it would be ridiculous.
So, which one the problem could be?
Maybe, it might be that those knowledge are not oriented to real life but to specific areas that, despite of being valid, are not sufficient.
However, if we focus on university life, the reason could be just one: needs.
That is to say: lack of time to develop subject, lack of media... or perhaps, just the opposite, an excess of academic matters.
A lot of fields are studied, without being too much developed, just giving general ideas about them.
As a conclusion: is this better than specialisation? That is up to each one.
Maybe a point in between would be the solution.

SPM10009,3.5,3.0,,,,,"In the words of the old song: ""Money is the root of all evil""","
To talk about money, we should think firstly in the answer of the following question: Is really money the beginning of our happiness or is it, however, the beginning of our misfortune? It depends clearly on the use that each person makes of ?t.
If we consider a nation, a country, or a town, we must think that the most important factor that makes ?t to develop or to grow up (in all its aspects: political, social, cultural ... ) s its economy: the money. Normally, when a nation has money or a special kind of power, this is used to expand its frontiers, to get new horizons and to have more and more. But this becomes dangerous when these nations go too far and begin to take advantage of its situation: They have money, then, they can dominate to those who are in an inferior position. It's just here, where starts the confrontation between them, and because of this, it is produced the wars, the conflicts, the fights and so on. There is no equality and this is the problem. If we have money, we make an unsuitable use of ?t and we demean ourselves like a nation or like a group of people. On the other hand, if we don't have money, then, we are going to be dominated and we are not going to be able to develop in our own. Obviously, this doesn't happen in all the cases. So, we can find some powerful nations, which are conscious of their power and however, they don't make an unfair use of it.
Now we are going to deal with another situation: what happen when this occurs from the point of view of an individual case? Is this maybe a more relevant fact? We wll think in both cases: the first one, people who have money and the second one, people who have not. There is a big difference between them and between their ways of life. In the first case, if we consider a person who has a lot of money, we know that he/she doesn't have problems to survive. Indeed, they enjoy of a big number of things: they have a good job, good huses, cars, clothes, etc ... But, are they happy with all these material holdings? Are they nice and sensible people? The answer is not unquestionable, but the big majority becomes ambitious, selfish and pitiless people. In the second case, all of us know that people who have no money and who live in poverty can not develop themselves in social life, and the society is the guilty they don't have the same posibilitas as the others. They stay, almost all the tme, in the same enviroment and places. Moreover, they have serious difficulties to survive. So, are they able in this situation to think positively? Do they feel the happiness and the freedom that life can offer? No, because they live in an oppresive world that make them unhappy and unsafe.
In all these cases, we can see that money is an important factor in everybody's life, but ?t also brings a lot of problems. Taking into account these aspects, which is the best way we can choose in terms of money:	to have or not to have? This is the question...

It is difficult to imagine this world of ours unimaginative and dreamless. In fact I would think it to be quite impossible to excist in this techologycal world without any kind of dream or imagination. I would say that it takes a lot of it to even live in it.
But the question is, do we have the time to dream, is there any place for it in our lives? Well, to find this out we must compare our modern world with the times before it turned into what it is today, industrial and technologycal.
In the earlier days people did not have all the stress on the assembly line like we have today. I guess that that gave them more time to think and dream. They lead a more simple life with out any interference from the world outside their own and I am quite sure that this is affecting our dreams.
Our dreams may have changed, our wishes is sometimes quite different from the earlier days, but I guess that we still have some dreams in common. We still dream about true love, fortunes and eternal life. These wishes are not fulfilled more frequently today than they were berore. But some of the dreams and the wishes we have today are fulfilled thanks to our modern technology and I think that we should be thankful for that. For there is no point in dreaming if you can not get one single dream realized in your whole life.
Modern technology has damaged our childrens ability to imagine things. They are incapable of playing with things like LEGO and bricks and other toys that demands a bit of imagination. Today toys has to be developed in detail. Everything has to be formed in plastic with strict playing rules and instructions on how you should play leaving no room for you own imagination. With commercials and advertisements you are told what is inn and cool to play with. Disney figures casted in plastic, Barbie and her friend Kent, Ninja Turtles, Batman and heaven knows what!
Children can not be blamed for their lack of imagination. They can not help all this garbage is being thrown upon them. Business men in the industries should be blamed for it. They are the ones who are making big profits selling interior decorations for Barbie one year and miniature Batmobiles the next.
Men and women dream about different things. Men are dreaming about their careers, money and red sports cars! Maybe I'm being a bit prejudiced and not very deep. But I have not yet meet a man who would not like to change his car to a newer and faster one!
Women they still dream about children and homes. Again I am taking the risk of being accused of being prejudicedand I would therefor like to point out that women have approached a few male dreams. Like the dream of a great career and being independent.
We all dream about the future and try to imagine what it might bring us. Dreaming is hoping and hoping means faith in life, so if we stop dreaming we will stop living.

The world of today is basically demythologized, still quite a few people are interested in myths because the myths have a message for them. As a matter of fact they are stories about rules of living. What we learn in our schools today are not words of wisdom. We learn technology, we get information. Our world seems to have been drained of spiritual values. People feel powerless. That is precisely what I believe is modern society's curse, this powerlessness, the weariness people feel, the alienation from the world that they live in. A social stagnation with artificial life and false life span, which has taken over. Maybe we need a hero that will give expression to our deepest yearnings.
Does society need heroes? Yes, I think so. Because needs images that will keep all the disrupted tendencies together and gather them into a purpose. The myths help us to realize that there is a possibility to achieve completion, to be able to use all our strength and to bring joy into the world. To kill the monsters and the fire-spitting dragons is to defeat darkness.
What happens then, if society does not have any powerfull mythology anymore? Our teenagers loose faith in the religions in which they have been raised and turn inward. They often do this with the sopport of drugs. Society has not assigned any rituals that will make them members of the tribe and the community. This is the essential meaning of the initiation ceremonies. In primitive societies they strike out teeth, inscribe scars on their bodies and practise circumcision etc.
In modern cities like New York for example teenagers create their own rites. That is why there is graffitti all over the city. They have their own gangs, their own initiation rites, and their own laws. But they are dangerous, because their laws are not the laws of the city. They have not een taken up in the society.
Is modern society so devoid of hope then? I do not think it has to be that way. In our technological society where most of our dreams and fantasies are represented in films and videogames, there is a growing tendency to create new factasies of our own. People are getting tired of having everything served on a silver plate. We need to create new myths and at the same time to look back in search for old lost ones.
In the myth, there is no argument against industry and science. When you plunge into a totally unknown adventure and make a path, Wheater it is some sort of technological breakthrough or simply a new way of living, you run the risk of getting too enthusiastic or to neglect certain mechanical aspects then you will most certainly fail. When assenting to one's longings, enthusiasm, and feelings you have to keep your head cool, so that it will not lead you straight into calamity. I cannot recognize any opposition between science and mythology. Science itself is now drawing nearer the dimensions of mystery, soon it will have reached the border. The border between that which can be understood and that which will never be clear, because it is a mystery that is beyond the reach of human reseach. For instance; we do not even know what a nucleus is, if it is a wave or a particle - maybe it is both.
What kind of myths will incorporate the machine into our new world? The cars are already there in mythology that is. They are in our dreams. Airplanes too, play an important role in the service of imagination. The voyage of the airplane represents the liberation from earth, in a way pretty much like birds symbolizing freedom. And now it is also time for the computor to introduce itself in the world of fantasy. The computor that many people regard as omnipotent god, with its software going in and out of it, as if they were angels bringing information from earth.
Not only do I believe that there is a place for imagination in our technological society, but furthermore I am quite convinced that it is neccesary for us and future generations to keep on dreaming. Really one of the most important differences between machines and humans, is that humans are capable of imagining things, while a machine is directed by certain signals and commands. In order to be master and inventor of our technological devices, we must continue doing what humans have done for several thousands of years - that of dreaming and imagining.

Few of Orwell's predictions in his famous book 1984, as well as other more or less frightening future prognostics, have been fulfilled. After the fall of communism, with despots and other destructive powers kept in check - if not totally - many people feel at ease and allow themselves to be more optimistic about future.
It is supposed that the often seemingly negative attitude of most of the news media to technical development, and the perpetual reportings on environmental destruction, shortage of resources, war, terrorism etc., should make us disillusioned and apathetic about life. The fact that news like that appeal to many people does not give any proof of growing indifference or apathy about the ongoing scientifical evolution on (or destruction of) our planet. And we should not forget that technical science can constitute a powerful instrument in the fight against poverty, diseases and environmental problems. Wouldn't that stimulate our imagination and creative ability?
The development of an idea into an invention and a technical device often takes place under adverse and discouraging circumstances. Edison's idea about making an electric bulb was ridiculed rather than encouraged by his contemporaries. History has shown that great achievements have often taken place during periods of hardship and difficulties. Problems and needs should be treated as a challenge or opportunity to start some meaningful work in order to find the solutions to them. We need optimistic dreamers who put ideas into action and treat problems as possibilities. If you listen to doomsday prophecies about death and destruction and pay heed to their sayings you'll probably end up without any dreams left. Such forecasts have seldom been fulfilled and should not be allowed to rob us of our creative facilities.
You have probably heard people say that there is no more to investigate on our earth, no unknown wilderness to explore or tribes to be discovered, so we have to get into the space or plunge into the bottom of the vast oceans to make new discoveries. Some people are frightened by modern technology, not only destructive weapons, but even computers which are often believed to be a threat to personal integrity. The truth is, however, if you get acquainted with computers you usually get fascinated as well.
In our fast changing society we have to change our dreams and make them up to date, so to speak, - escapism and nostalgia only create frustration and disappointment - and embrace technology with its fast development in order to be ""positive dreamers"". Patent agencies all over the world can give evidence of an ever increasing stream of inventions. Man was born curious and made to be a conqueror.
Technological development in general, such as electronics, computer technology, bio-tech, medical science etc. seldom appeals to the imagination of most people. But the fact remains that tomorrow's generation is a lot more fascinated by the accelerating development of technology, frequently taken advantage of by filmmakers. A great number of American cartoons, mainly aimed at children, have aroused the imagination of many people with its ""winged cars"" (stylish sports cars with in-built wings which make them flyable when pushed aside) as well as other enticing vehicles and gadgets. Dreams like that will undoubtedly affect the future of many children. Any why shouldn't some of them come into existence?
A few years ago some Russians claimed to have constructed easy-to-use flying skis equipped with a small engine and a fast-turning metal blade like on a helicopter. The future will show if there will be any flying skis or winged cars or what dreams will be materialized.
Science technology and industrialization are often, as we have seen, the stimuli and the means to the fulfillment of many of our dreams and imaginations. There are logical reasons which indicate that this will be so in the future too.

In our time everything has to do with money, efficiency and prestige. Everyone strives to find himself a place in society, to get an education and make lots of money, for example as an engineer. An engineer who spends his whole life trying to figure out new ways to produce new meaningless, mass-produced products that people don't need, but buy anyway because they are brainwashed to believe that a new color-TV will make their lives happier and better.
When the next generation comes there are new scientists and new products. This new generation will think that they are the smartest and most important that ever lived on the planet, and after them a new generation will come, convinced that they understand everything etc. There is no interest in spiritual values and harmony with nature anymore, only technological development.
That is how I find the present situation in the world, and we accept it because we are afraid and programmed to believe that this is the right way to live. We have so much respect for the sciences and for those in power that we no longer dream and use our fantasy. It is as if people completely have lost their faith in themselves and given up because they think that life is so complex it can only be understood by scientists who are the only ones supposed to have all the answers and entitled to point out the direction of our lives.
I resent this common feeling of inferiority and want people to have some self-reliance and pride. We must stop being afraid and suppressed, stop viewing time as linear and stop forgetting our history, our connections to nature and older generations. Look for your imagination (a very much neglected part of the human mind). Try to find new ways to enjoy life. Nobody in this world has the right to take away another person's dreams and visions. The mechanic's and the farmer's dreams are just as valuable as those of the doctor and the lawyer.
It is very important people don't lose the incentive in their lives. They must realize that nobody else can or is allowed to live their lives. We must look into ourselves and forget all the boring scientific theories which have taken hold of our sense of reality, quelling all the good things in life.
I say: Bring out your imagination. Don't be afraid to be different. Do whatever feels good to you, ignore the manipulated majority who just strive to gain material success and prestige. Eventually they just might begin to follow suit and reconsider.

The question whether there is a place for imagination and dreaming in the modern, technological world dominated by science, is an important one. Imagination, fantasy and empathy are necessary for the creation of art and culture. ""Dreaming"" or letting your own thoughts travel on unknown seas and in unknown areas, are perhaps more conducive to solving your psychological strains, cleansing the mind from the pressures of reality in order to achieve calmness and peace of mind.
If imagination and dreaming are turned out of the modern world it would indeed be a disastrous world to live in. But I do not think that is the case, I am happy to state. The person who laments the demise of dreaming and imagination is usually the same person who complains about children watching TV. This person thinks that ""watching TV destroys the imagination"", but she never deprecates children form watching a play on the theatre or a puppet theatre in the amusement park. I would say that there simply is no essential difference between watching TV and watching live theatre, as regards the faculty in the child to use imagination and dreaming after it has seen the TV-program or the play.
What about books versus TV then? Admittedly, the book forces the reader to use her own thoughts to imagine the faces of the characters and the setting of the places described. But, if we use the novel Jane Eyre as an example, I find my imagination stirred and enhanced as a result of having seen the BBC series on TV. Now that I have suggestions of the faces and settings, I can better imagine the thoughts and psychological interior or exterior conflicts of the characters, and also how the different settings and sceneries may affect the protagonists.
In the world before the emergence of science, technology and industrialisation, let us say in the Middle Ages in Europe, there were perhaps more imagination and dreaming in the theories of how the world looked like, how it had started to exist and in explaining the forces and rules of nature. The common man in Europe lived in an almost totally incomprehensible world and the only explanations certainly did not make the common man less afraid of the world and nature surrounding him. The Devil and his dark forces had their grip on everything in this world and the only rescue from it was death and the doubtful ascension to heaven.
So, science and technology have provided the common man with more knowledge of how the world works. But the area for imagination and fantasy is not diminished in a decisive way because of that. The theory of the Big Bang, the nature of electricity and magnetism and mysteries of the particles in the atom all stir my imagination in a satisfying degree. What is more, we have a whole new genre in literature as a result of the emergence of modern science and technology, the genre of science fiction. In the Middle Ages they had fantasies of how man and animals looked like in Africa and Asia, and later in the Renaissance how it was in the new continents of North and South America. Today we dream of life on other planets, space travel and even reaching other galaxies than our own, transgressing the constrictive boundaries of time and infinite space.
In conclusion, I maintain that the scope for dreaming and imagination is no less today than it was before industrialisation and the emergence of science and technology. On the contrary, the scope may even be widened. It is very much a question of intelligence and critical thinking, and the children's parents (and teachers) have the responsibility for developing these faculties in the children.

Does there still exist any dreaming and imagination in the world today? Many people surely doubt that having the big and fast development within technology in mind. We are very much influenced through television which is a technological media that exists in practically all homes today. A modern home has also electrical and electronic aids and instruments today that would have been unimaginable only 25 years ago. This might be ""for better or for worse"" of course. I, myself, believe there still exists dreaming and imagination among people in spite of this, among old people as well as children. Well, why do I draw this conclusion? Let's first make a definition of the words imagination and technology.
To define the word technology in a small and precise way seems hard since the word includes a number of ideas. In Roget's Thesaurus of Words and Phrases one will find that technology is: ""production, physics, science, business, means, mechanics and skill"". If I pick out ""production"" I will find the meaning to be ""mental creation"" and thus associable to imagination. Oxford's Advanced Learner's Dictionary of Current English gives a somewhat more limited explanation - technology is ""a study, mastery and utilization of manufacturing methods and industrial arts"". In Longmans English Larousse technology is ""the science of technical processes a wide, though related, field of knowledge"".
What do we mean by imagination then? Roget's Thesaurus' subtitles are: ""vision, thought, idea, imagination, and falsehood"". In narrowing it down one will find that imagination is ""perception, creativeness, inventiveness, extasy, inspiration, fantasy, originality and work of fiction"". Oxford's Advanced Learner's gives us imagination as ""an ability to form mental images or pictures"" and to ""use the ability in a practical or creative way"" but also ""thing experienced in the mind and not in the reality"". Longmans Larousse says among other things that imagination is ""the power to form new ideas by a synthesis of separate elements of experience, and the ability to define new ideas"". To me I think technology and imagination are very much interrelated, and then on the other hand I understand that they also can be seen as separate.
A modern Swedish household today with a family of two adults and two children is full of modern technology. I looked up friends of mine and found that they have a washing machine, a dryer, a very modern cooker, a microwave oven, a mixer, a dishwasher, fridge freezer, a personal computer and printer, a stereo, a television, a video, a telephone with an answering machine, a vacuum cleaner and much more. But to invent all these machines and instruments require not only skill and knowledge but a great deal of imagination from the beginning.
In this particular family the children, age five and three, surely still have a lot of imagination inspite of what the video and TV can offer. They like to draw and paint fantasy flowers, fantastic boats, houses and animals or things that have imaginative names. They enjoy very much listening to fairy tales with gnomes and witches as the main figures. They imaginative friends to whom they tell secrets.
But what about the teenagers today? I interviewed a young man 18 years old and he surely has his imagination rather intact, although he also is influenced by television and especially the programmes that show the technology that brings forward something never used before. He has a PC of his own and in it he has a variety of programs from advanced mathematics, music with notes, composing possibilities and word processing to silly little games - like e.g. collecting treasures in a dark forest bouncing a ball. But he often listens to classical music and plays the violin and when doing so having images of storms, oceans and dark forests but also sunshine, peace and other things not revealed. His favourite books are those by Tolkien and Jules Verne. No one has told imaginative stories the way Tolkien has! This particular young man also likes to travel and looks forward to the next time he can visit Egypt, seeing the pyramids, imagining what might have been happening more than 2000 years ago.
Looking into the world of art - painting. composing and writing fiction - there is a never-ceasing stream of production. If you compare the situation some years ago with today the difference might be that artists today take advantage of the technology to a larger extent. They use e.g. a word processor as an aid to write or compose. But the story or the musical piece might still be very imaginative.
I think we all dream to a certain extent. I dream and imagine but when one grows older one is unfortunately often disillusioned by disappointing experiences. But still we will continue to dream and imagine again and again. It is within every human being a never ending need for dreaming, helping us to live in harmony with ourselves and others. I think that to have the imagination of a child from time to time certainly makes the life a little more funny and satisfactory and I feel sorry for those who think they have forgotten to imagine. We must always try to influence our children not to lose their imagination, or we might end up in a ""nothing land"" as Michael Ende describes it in his book ""The neverending story"".

""Once upon a time there was an old boozer who walked around in the streets. When he got tired he found himself a dustbin to take a nap in. Along came the refuse lorry and picked the dustbin up, and emptied the dustbin into the back of the lorry, where everything was crushed!""
This nighttime-story was once told to me in quite a matter-of-fact manner, by a five-year-old friend of mine. I felt devastated, and objected: ""But the poor old man was in the dustbin and got crushed with the refuse!!"" The little angelic boy answered: ""That's okay. It was just an old boozer. I told you so!""
Where did the seed that grew into this hideous picture in this little boy come from? What does the frame of reference surrounding the picture look like? Imagination does not spring from nowhere. The little boy, as it were, is only the soil from which things grow. The world around him contains the seeds for the plants that germinate, may they be thistles or cowslips.
The questions raised in this paper is whether there is still room for dreaming and imagination in this our modern world, dominated by science, technology and industrialization. Since childhood appears to be the most imaginationstudded period of one's life, I have chosen to elaborate somewhat on the impact of the enormous informationflow of today, on this period of one's life, created and made possible by the explosive development in high technology. Over the past twenty years open to my conscious observation there has been an increase in the amount of information pressed onto one daily, primarily by means of television.
Today all information is available to everyone, at once! It sounds like a commercial slogan. I say that it is a description of our lives today. A killerwhale is born in the U.S. under the gaze of an entire world. It is broadcast via satellite without delay. How wonderful! We all get to participate in a miracle. Two small children are shot dead in Bosnia, under the gaze of the entire world. It is broadcast via satellite without delay. We all - children included - get to participate in a war... ""Did you see the movie 'Plutoon'?"" ""Yes, an exciting movie!"" "" And, did you see CNN's 'War in the Persian Gulf'?"" ""Yes, an exciting ...""
Hopefully we as adults can distinguish fiction from fact, but do children know how to? Well, parents should explain, obviously, and I am convinced they do. But children keep so much to themselves, and construe private chains of causality in their thoughts. Just recently I talked to a little boy who thought that one could easily attract cancer and aids from poison. I would imagine that he has taken part of alot of the good-intentioned information of the media and from that made up his own picture of how it all comes about...
So, my answer to the question about wether there is still a place for imagination and dreaming in our hightech world is in the affirmative. However, the information input, the seed that we plant to grow, and the immediacy of it, the toxic fertilizer poured onto it, may create no gilt-edged cowslip-dreams or elaborate flowers of imagination, but hardened thistle-nightmares and edifices of angiush in a child. By this, I am not saying 'Banish TV!' or 'Save children from all evil!'. I am merely pointing out that the information given to children must not be fathomless, so that they drown in existential despair, or worse, take it all for one eternal movie to which they are but spectators without say, without capacity for emotional reactions and empathy.

Our world today does look a lot different from the world a hundred years ago. Not only are there more people populating the earth but the terms of existing have also changed rapidly. To people in the western world these changes have usually meant that new technologies have been introduced, mostly in order to facilitate life. There is no denying that much of the technology has facilitated life. For example cars and planes, but also telephones have shortened the distances and made places accessible with, relatively speaking, little loss of time. If we move into the kitchens of modern homes many of the appliances visible there are indeed time-saving (e g the microwave oven) and do facilitate life to many busy people.
Now, I have talked a lot about time-saving and facilitating technologies because indeed I think that is what much of modern technology aims at today: to make it possible for us to save time. But then the question arises, what are we saving time for? The simple, but somewhat dejecting, answer to that question is, I think, we do not know what we are saving our time for, or rather we have forgotten why we started to save time in the first place. The next question then to demand an answer is, how does this time-saving menatality affect us? My opinion is that it has affected our way of thinking, dreaming, and imagining in quite a serious way.
I do not want to maintain that our ancestors had a more refined manner when it came to dreaming and imagining. Neither do I want to argue that modern men and women do not dream and imagine things at all. I am quite convinced that most of us nurture dreams and hopes for the future just as people always have had dreams and hopes for the future just as people always have had dreams and hopes for a better future for themselves and their children. In short, the content of our dreams and imaginations has not changed, but the manner in which we dream and imagine things have. The reason for this could be traced back to the impact of modern technology.
As I mentioned earlier, today's technology aims at saving time. But, in doing so it also makes everything go faster. And, in going faster it makes us believe that it is a good thing if we manage to get more done in the same time. This is the crucial point, because I believe that our dreaming and imagination have changed along this line so that we do not take the time to finish our trains of thought because we try to ""stuff"" our dreams with as much input as possible.
The problem isn't that there isn't any place for dreaming and imagination; the problem is that there are far too many places, and far too many ready dreams served us through the television and videos and far too little time to finish our dreams. Although technology has made it possible for us to save time with different kinds of machines, it has not enabled us to take the time to slow down and spend our saved-up time on finishing our dreams in our thoughts.

Millions of people throughout the world are afraid of the two terms technology and science. This enormous group of individuals are anxious of what the growth of technology and science will mean to the human race and nature in the immediate future. I understand that people are worried about these main questions that dominate the society of today, but I must admit that I am in the firm conviction that the sources of dreaming and especially imagination go hand in hand with science, technology and, naturally, industrialization.
Technology, science and industrialization of today is based on some kind of basic idea. These ideas have developed with help and support of great dreams and imagination. Consider scientists lacking any source of imagination what so ever. This consideration is completely out of the question, even scientists that work with the most complicated fields of research inhabit a great amount of imagination, or else their results would become failures or even worse, disasters.
Every specific individual must have a dream, or hopefully a mass of dreams that are important especially for him or her. Dreams include everything. Most people dream of personal achievements. Suceeding in life and establishing a family are popular dreams, but individuals in general dream of global achievements, peace in troubled areas and help for the poor, for instance. People who are unwell dream of recovering from their illnesses. Healthy human beings are terrified of the thought of falling ill, and are therefore imagining how life would change if something similar occurred.
Swedens high unemployment gives birth to many miserable dreamers. If the unemployed didnt have dreams and hopes for the future, they would soon fall on evil days.
According to me, the only category of human beings we could- and we should feel a bit anxious for, are the present generation of children. Children of the 90s are brought up with purchased imagination. -Where are all those girlish girls that used to play with dolls and attend tea parties? Not to mention the boys, who have, since the beginning of this century, played with match-box cars and exchanged baseball cards?
-Well, we can now observe that both sexes have one or perhaps two common interests; Ninja Turtles and video games in different degrees of difficulties and in all sorts of appearances. Today, most children (not all, thank god!) find it almost inconceivable to go out in the woods to play and in that way discover nature. -No, children of today appreciate ""Mario"" much better, or any other creature in the electronic brains that can do the job of thinking and imagining for them.
The children are naturally not the thieves in this drama. The parents are the real robbers, taking the childrens imagination from them through buying the horrible games. Hopefully, these ""children of the 90s"" will achieve their imagination from school, in situations that demand sources of inventiveness.
Dreaming and imagination are two important factors in our lives. -Dont we all feel great satisfaction now and then, when one of our dreams actually come true? Despite most dreams stay in the heart and mind of the dreamer and never become reality, the dreams might make him, or her, encouraged to fight in this cold world, and maybe, make life a little better. Not only for him or her, but for the entire human race.
Martin Luther Kings most famous speech begins with the words  - In this context, these magic words have great importance for the present inhabitants on earth, but they will also have significance for generations to come. They will, just like Martin Luther King and all of us that live on the earth today, strive for success and keep on dreaming...

In this essay I will give an account of how I look upon the collaboration between technology and imagination in modern society. I thoroughly believe that those are two different sides of the same matter, where the inventor turns his own or others dreams and fantasies into reality.
With a few examples I will try to support the fact that my theory stands throughout the centuries and that presumably humanity always has been of the opinion that the newfound technology at that time was at the range of possibility. Thus, seen in a historical perspective I am sure that many people have argued that there no longer was room for dreaming and imagination.
I am quite sure that this was said by people contemporary with one of the principal intellectual leaders in the fifteenth century, Leonardo da Vinci. Yet he invented among other things the submarine and some sort of apparatus for flying. Who knows, perhaps he got his inspiration for his flying machines from the Greek mythology about Icaros with his wings made of feathers.
Originally, some of da Vincis innovations were not used practically - but I am convinced that they arose the imagination and dreams of others. Perhaps it was these impulses that through the Montgolfier brothers airballoons in the eighteenth century gave us a technique that not even da Vinci could imagine. I am now thinking about nuclear-powered submarines and space-craft.
When James Watt in the eighteenth century designed his steam-engines, I believe that he used his imagination to develop the rotating machine. We can also assume that the imaginative author Jules Vernes has inspired contemporary inventors by his literary works.
In several cities in Sweden there are something called ""Science Centres"". These are some kind of technical museums, which especially address themselves to young people. At a Science Centre you can study and participate in a great many different experiments such as using parabolic antennas to carry on a whispering conversation across a huge hall. It might be a tremendous incentive to children to be able to take part in these phenomena, and this in turn probably means that society will receive fresh inspiration from them.
Certainly the dream to improve the world has inspired many great inventors. My personal belief is that whenever the human race has enjoyed a new technique, sages have felt that this was the limit. Luckily, there has always been dreamers and visionaries. Where would we be today if people had run out of dreams and visions centuries ago?
Unfortunately, there are several disadvantages with modern technique. Research within genetic engineering should never be allowed to strech so far that the dream of a better world is turned into a nightmare of distortions and manipulations of human and animal genetic material. Furthermore, we cannot be content with a technique which continues to create environmental problems both on Mother Earth and in ther surrounding sky.
Together with several others, I have a dream of a different and better technique within all fields, and I am convinced that a future Leonardo da Vinci will solve our problems without placing humanity in a society such as in Orwells ""1984"". In our society, there must always be a place for dreams and imagination!

In our world where technology is an important factor its hard to believe that theres any place for imagination and dreaming, but in my opinion there is. Science and imagination go hand in hand and its thanks to scientific progress that some of our dreams can come true. If we look at the things that science has accomplished to satisfy the needs of human race they are innumerable.
A long time ago when man realised that he couldnt walk on water he invented something that could float on the surface so he could cross the watercourse without getting wet. If people in those days werent able to imagine themselves going over water staying dry they would continue to swim over. In our time era the old raft has turned into a yacht but its still because of our imagination. If we didnt have time to dream we would have kept on crossing rivers with a raft.
The train is another example of what dreaming and imagination have provided us with. The general opinion is that speed and dreaming dont go together at all when they in fact do. Its possible to dream away even at high speed. To go by train is actually quite pleasant. You can lean back and just watch the landscape pass by and daydream. The only thing you have to worry about is what station youre getting off at. This shows that not only can technology provide means of transport but also places for us to dream in.
The ability to fly has probably been mans greatest dream ever since he was put on this earth. We have always envied the birds and their freedom to fly away wherever they want and whenever they want. For many years men and women have pondered over how to make it possible for man to fly and they succeeded. Its now feasible for us to fly, not by our own machine though, but with a little help. We can sit in an airplane and travel around the world thinking about lifes mysteries at the same time. Its a great combination! Theres almost never a dream that technology and science cant turn into reality. But, of course, it depends on what your dreams are and I can only talk for myself.
The fact that many people claim that theres no room for dreaming in this world has very likely derived from fear. Theyre afraid that technological advances will take over too much and leave them without something to do. People are afraid of feeling inadequate and no longer being needed. Dreaming is one way to get away from it all and since they cant relax they have to blame it on something, namely development. Technology doesnt keep us from dreaming, it clears the way for more and higher striving dreams.
The reason for people feeling that they dont have enough time for fantasies and imagination is all our obligations. Everyone of us has things that we have to do, whether we work or go to school. So even if we want to devote a large amount of time to imagination its just not conceivable and it has nothing to do with our well-advanced world.
Something that has to be taken into consideration is why technology is moving so fast. It isnt something happening by itself, we are all a part of it. Our aspiration for a more convenient and carefree life is a reason for the fast-moving progress within technology. Since were helping science on its way to become dominating, maybe without knowing it, we cant blame it for not giving us enough time to dream away.
Another aspect to have in mind is why we feel the need for imagination? Is it because we like the idea of imagining things that can never be for real or is it to dream about things that actually can happen if we just put our minds to it? If the last reason is the most probable or common one there is no reason why technology and imagination cant be two parts of a united whole. After all, society would not be so high developed and advanced if it werent for our imagination and striving for a better world.

In our western society of today, life is filled with all kinds of obstructions. Our lifes consist of artificial needs that take up most of our conscious time. Although we get more and more spare time it is mostly not used for reading, dreaming or enjoying. There is no time for this, after work we go home and switch on the TV. There are certain programes we can not manage without, and while sitting infront of the TV we watch whatever in between these programes too. So we stay attatched to it until bedtime.
Our dreams are created by the instruments of technology. Imagining, dreaming and thinking has been taken care of by the Television, or another tool from the world of technology. We are no longer expected to draw our own conclusions, make our own decisions, or form our lifes individually.
I am not saying that everything was better before, nor am I eulogizing past times. But I do believe that we have lost much of our knowledge of ourselves. Unfortunally improved living conditions are not the same thing as improved mental welfare. Perhaps the unwillingness to look at ourselves comes from the fact that we are afraid of what we will see. That although we are not hungry and although we can afford much more than we are in needof, we might not be happy. I also believe that we demand more of life, we want to be more than we are. This comes from ideal images forced upon us by companies (through advertising), TV channels and other creators of public opinion.
Science has found The Solutions to most things that we before did not know anything about. Not long ago stories were created to explain our existence. Myths about creation, universe and life were needed to comfort people. Our past was more important than it is nowadays. Today science is our new religion, all answers are found here, there are no room for imagination, no need for speculation.
This is of course not only bad, prejudges and dread of supernatural things have lost much of their importance. We do not judge people if sick or different, at least we are not able to convict them of some ungodly behavior.
Science is good in most circumstances, but as I mentioned: with the good things that it has brought us, it also has helped in taking away much of our sense of imagining.
All of us need time to sit down and think. Think about our own life, our own dreams. We need to ask our selves 'What do I really want to do?', 'am I really happy with this life Im living?'. Of course it is much easier not to stop up and reflect over the life we are living. It is easier to follow the main stream. But if you do hold on a minute and you do find out that you do not want to walk in 'the Aisle of Life' anymore, your 501:s, sort of, does not fit anymore. Then you are brave if you leave your former life and create a new one living as close as possible to your own ideals.

Over the years we have become more aware of and even dependent on the evolution in the field of technology and science. The media, computers and improved communication for instance, constitute an enormous power in our modern society and affect our lifestyles in various ways. However, I do not believe that these pose a threat to individual dreaming and imagination.
In order to be able to discuss the subject let me first mention some situations when dreaming and imagination are used and how.
We use them as aids when we want to solve a problem in a new way. Then we have to approach the problem in different ways to find out the best or most accurate solution.
Another important situation is when we want to escape from everyday life cares by dreaming of places remote in time or space, as we do when we read books or daydream.
It is equally important to be able to imagine or evaluate things that we learn about in school or in our everyday lives. Without imagination we would probably just accept news, information and opinions already made up by TV- or newspaper reporters. This would gradually force us into an unwanted conformity.
I do not consider technology and imagination being poles apart. On the contrary, technological and scientific progress would not have been possible without it.
Technology and science have made a great impact in some of the areas mentioned earlier. In most cases they have not been substitutes for imagination, but rather compliments to, or aids for individual creativity. If it had not been for industrialization, technological progress and improved communications, books would not have been so easily attainable and we would have to spend many hours calculating complicated mathematical problems.
Admittedly, there is a risk that our modern society becomes too concentrated on the fact that we should be efficient and deal with our duties at a rapid pace. Accordingly, our tasks should yield a profit and, unfortunately, that may lead to a lack of aesthetical evaluations because their importance can not be valued in time or money.
Computer-assisted instruction (CAI), a fairly new learning method, has shown that sometimes it is especially important to have well-balanced proportions of technology and imagination. Results from research show that learning is more rapid with CAI than with other training methods.
However, since the time spent on learning is rather short, the material tends to be forgotten soon after the learning occasion. Compared to that, if ordinary training methods are used it may take a longer time to learn a certain task, but since you have to use your imagination to comprehend and organize the information properly, you are likely to remember it better and for a longer time.
Finally, I think it is important that we accept and learn to live with technology as a natural part of our lives, because it is. By that, I do not mean that we should avoid using our imagination but use both in a wellpoised combination in order to gain the most fruitful outcome.

 This is a part of a poem called  written by Rupert Brooke. The poem is like a day-dream; a way to escape from the thoughts of World War I, in which Brooke partook and which causes he died for. Do people today dream and imagine things as much as they did in the turn of the century?
The suggestion has been made that in this age of technology and science we have no place to dream and imagine. Many dreams and imaginations of the people living in the early part of the century are now a reality. This doesnt mean that we no longer have a place for dreams, though.
What do we people dream of, in the first place? There are three large cathegories: 1. The imaginative, impossible dream; of todays values.
2. The dream one would like to come true.
3. The dream of the past, the good-old days.
Of these alternatives, it is number one which is most likely to grow smaller. I dont think it does, however. Our brain is a complicated place where there is always more space for extraordinary new inventions. Even before Christ was born, the Bible was written; and still Orwell was able to write 1984 in the 40s with new ideas about the future.
During the last few years people have grown more aware of the fact that we cant spend our lives bustling about. We have to stop and think about what we are doing once in a while. This has a positive effect on our imaginative and dreaming part of the brain. We start to think about what we want in life, that is dream of the possible, and what has happened in our lives already. Those dreams should not be very different from those of our ancestors.
Since industrialization started, and even before that, people have tried to climb the social ladder. They dream of a better life, imagining perhaps how it would be to live in a larger home. Today people are more equal and to most people it is their actions that will get them where they want to go. As a part of the American Dream, that has spread throughout the world, a goal in life is important. Most people see this goal before them, as something to dream of and struggle for.
There are some people, surely, that dont want to dream. These people existed in the 19th century as well. It is often those who are left out of our society - we have no space for them - they dont have a place to fill. To say thet these people are so desillusioned as not to dream, though, would be a lie. All people dream and imagine things. If they believe in it is another question.
Today, more than ever, it is highly important to dream. In our sometimes cold and hard world we need a shelter, a place to hide from reality. Even if it is difficult to find a place for this, it is important that we do. Without dreams and imagination our world would be boring to death...

Our modern society is soon to reach the year two thousands. During the last one hundred years our world has started to become very much molded and dominated by science. This development is very likely to continue since the existence of available technology creates a demand for it. Technology makes life easier in many ways, but can the fact that we assimilate our lifestyles to fit the technological world also mean that society might no longer have room for imagination and unscheduled thoughts?
Discussing these things must of course involve a comparison between the scientific world of today and what society looked like before modern technology had its breakthrough. One area where technology has evolved is within writing. Good handwriting was for long regarded as an art while handwritten texts are today more or less only used in private correspondence. They are even quite often considered to be less serious and respectful than something written on a computer. Naturally, machine written texts are easier to read but this standardization may also make reading and writing less personal.
Another breakthrough area is the field of communication. In our every day life we are bound to be exposed to different machines that are to improve our social life. This can be either a one way or a two way communication. The amount of hours an average person spends watching TV, listening to the radio, playing electronic games or simply talking on the telephone makes one wonder how we ever got by before these things became available. Before technical social stimulus could be bought by money we most certainly had to be more inventive in order to make life interesting. On the other hand, since we used this inventivesness to create the technological world today we must have had a demand for it.
A third area is transport. In order for most of us to get to work in the morning we use either public transportation, a car, or a bike, and a few of us walk. Those of us who depend upon technology for our transportation know that it would be totally impossible for us to manage without it, if we did not change the location of our home. We have to organize our lives to fit the trains departures but on the other hand we have to be in time for work no matter what means of transportation we chose, even if modern technology did not exist. All it does is to increase the pace of life.
All these things require a certain amount of assimilation. There is also a tendency in society to trust the computer more than its creator: the human mind. We can surely escape this if we want to, by choice of profession and residence. Another alternative is to make sure that the technological items are constructed to fit human needs and not the other way around. Dreams and imaginations will surely continue even if our surroundings in the future will be spacecraft.

We, in the western world, live in a high-technological society where everything has to be done in the fastest and most effective way. Therefore, we, the citizens, live under a lot of preassure, for example from our employers and from society, and also to some extent from our families. The demands from them can ruin a person, unless he/she has the possibility to escape from them. One way of doing this is to go on a vacation, but you can do something less drastic than that, and that is by imagination. The world would be very boring if you cant or dont let yourself be swept away from time to time by a day dream or an imagination, away from the sometimes boring and eventless everyday life. But of course you cant live in a fantasy world, but unfortunately some do, and some of those people who do this ends up eventually in our asylums.
In our modern society, imagination and fantasy are very important ingredients, because you must have an imagination, a vision to be able to create and develop something. How else could people have gone to the moon, if other people hadnt dreamt about it, and from that dream, engineers and others developed a technique how to do it? Naturally, an imagination does not have to result in such a drastic thing as spacetravels. In all societies of all time, there has been a strive for comfort. Think for example how it was a couple of hundred years ago, when people were cleaning their houses. They had to use a broom to sweep the house. This was ineffective and hard work, and it also took a lot of time. And eventually, some people were thinking (I guess); ""How can we make the cleaning easier, more effective and faster?"" Maybe they had an image of a machine with a hose absorbing dust. And from this imagination they built the first vaccuum-cleaner. So I guess you can say that we have to thank imagination for all the commodities we have today.
But all ideas people have got out of a fantasy dont lead to good things. Theres always a possibility that things go to far, for example, look what the two super powers USA and the former Sovietunion did after the invention of the nuclear bomb. They started a hysterical armament race with all sorts of nuclear weapons!
So for some people, the technological society we live in encourage, in one way or the other, imagination and fantasy, while for some people, high-technology leads to an unused imagination. Children, especially, are in the risk zone. Chldren of today live and are influenced in a world full of Game Boy, TV-games and Ninja Turtles, not to mention all the grown ups employed to activate children on their (i.e. the children) spare time. This can lead to children never have to use their imagination, they dont hardly get a chance to develop one. Of course this doesnt happen to all children, but its tragic that it happens at all.
To sum up, I think that imagination and fantasy are and should be very important things in a persons life. We cant live without them, and it would be tragic if this high-technological world of ours would lead to the end of imagination and fantasy. But I dont think it will.

It is common knowledge that technical inventions dont have any imagination, and that they cant dream. But does this necessarily mean that an increase in technological development will entail a decrease in the imaginative powers of human beings? I think not.
It is common knowledge that science has proved fairies and goblins to be non-existent, but does scientific development necessarily entail a decrease in fairy-tales? I think not.
In this essay I will try to give some examples of what imagination and dreaming have come to today with some references to the past, and I will also try to answer the question as to wether there is a place for imagination and dreaming in our modern world dominated by technology and science, or not.
In former times imagination was part of everyday life. Most people scared their children to obedience by threatening them with various fantasy creatures, and wild and gruesome tales about fairies and trolls were told by the fireside in the evening.
Nowadays no one believes in fairies, and it would never occur to anyone to give porridge to the brownie out of fear. But this doesnt mean that we cant enjoy fairy-tales, or put a bowl of porridge on the doorstep at Christman. On the contrary we have got rid of the fear that went with old superstition, and kept the imaginative part of it.
In the 'old days', childrens toys were simple and often needed a good deal of imagination to actually become what they were supposed to be. It is often argued that children nowadays, with todays infinite range of almost too real toys, havent got any opportunity to use their imagination. But I dont think this is the case. I think that even though they dont any longer need their imaginative powers to create a live baby from a piece of carved wood (since they now have a ""baby-copy-doll"" that cries and crawls and says ""mummu"") they can still use their imagination to make the actual playing with the doll more vivid.
Apart from having modified already existing situations where we use our imagination, science and technology have also opened a whole new range of possibilities to it. With modern technology new fascinating discoveries about, for example, space have been made, discoveries that definitely stirs the imagination. Another kind of technology has made if possible to travel to places which people in the past wouldnt have dreamt of, but which nowadays may well be the cause of quite a lot of dreaming. Yet another kind of technology has given us access to books of all kinds, to a much larger extent than before, and if books dont provide excellent opportunities to use our imagination, I dont know what does.
It is common knowledge that science and technology havent got any imaginative qualities in them selves, but does this necessarily mean that there is no place for imagination and dreaming in a society dominated by them? I think not.
What I do think is that because of technological and scientific development, our imagination has taken a new, but not necessarily less desirable, form. The objects of our imagination have changed, but the quality, I think, is still as good - if not better.

Many people claim that in our modern world, dominated by science, technology and industrialization there is no longer a place for dreaming and imagination. Those who do, however, lack even the most basic knowledge of what our western society in fact is based upon and what it is that actually urges people to go on in their lives. It is fairly obvious that they know nothing about the close connections between peoples dreams of individual success, their needs to ""dream away"" and scientists ability to use their imagination, and our modern high-tech society. There is no exaggeration to say that society is based upon these two factors and that without either of them it would not be as extremely advanced as it is - it would be a completely static one.
Ever since the beginning of the history of humanity the main issue has been how to find ways of surviving under the often very harsh conditions that earth exposes its inhabitants to. Today the problem has been more or less solved, however, and this is mostly due to the fact that people throughout the centuries have used their imaginative skills to develop more and more advanced tools to be used in everyday life. A side effect of this is that more time has been allotted to dreaming.
Two of the major dreams in our modern age are to be successful at work, or to become financially independent. But in order to reach these goals people must use their imagination and dreams since they are what spurs them in their stives towards their goals.
But dreaming and imagination are also useful tools to ""get away"" from a dreary job or the conflicts with other people that modern life often subjects us to. In these cases they work as ""healers"" in which exhausted human souls can find peace and which allows them to dream away to other more exiting jobs, or into a world of sympathetic fellow human beings.
Even though personal achievements form a large part of the purpose of dreaming and imagination in a modern society, they are also useful in areas where society as a whole benefits from them. Scientists can be said to belong to a category of people of which a genuine interest to satisfy other peoples needs is their guiding light. But to reach success in this area a true interest in helping is not enough, a ""free"" mind - one that has the capability to develop entirely new trains of thought in fields that have never been explored before, is demanded. Perhaps the most significant difference between a good scientist and a genius can be said to be their personal capacity to use their imagination.
Dreaming and imagination are natural parts of the human character and peoples ability to use these resources are in fact what distinguishes them from all other living creatures on earth. They in themselves are important forces which help people to go on in life, assist them in their need to escape from a sometimes too demanding reality, or participate in exploring entirely new areas of science and technology. Yet, scientists are ordinary humans with dreams of money and fame, and perhaps it is not only their wish to aid humanity which spurs them, but also the dream of making the ultimate achievement and gaining public recognition - the dream of one day being rewarded with the Nobel Prize.

Our world is dominated by technology. Not a day passes without us being reminded of this fact by what we see or use.
The fact that science, technology and industrialization are so dominating in our society is a threat to our future happiness. The dominance makes us feel safe, since it is we ourselves who have created it. This feeling of security is false. Progress does not only bring good fortune, however we, with our blind faith in the future, seem to be wearing blinkers.
For instance, industrialization does not always bring progress of a positive nature. Think of the workers who are being made redundant as a result of it. Having to work under the threat of being made redundant is not living a life at ease. Consequently the employees perform badly due to their uneasy existence. Thanks to science and research new projects are being launched everyday. Projects which lead to several new places of employment in the end.
You see, we are all puppets in a theatre, and whoever pulls our strings does so without thought to our mental keep. Driving to work, working in the treadmill, keeping quiet and doing as we are told, that is how we live our lives.
The scientists come up with extraordinary, new findings. However, the truth of the matter is that it is no longer a question of developping new machines for our needs, but of developping new human needs for the machines. Of course, technology has given us a lot for which we are thankful, e g air-conditioning, and other things which we do not find that necessary, e g the egg-boiler.
In the hectic society of today the room for imagination is not as large as perhaps it used to be. People can not survive without any recreation or amusement and consequently find different ways to cope. There are, I find, three different categories, as follows: 	Firstly and largest is the category of people who have to look for ways of expressing their imagination in their spare time, since their trade gives no oppurtunity during working-hours. Therefore, even if they go at it from dawn to dusk, they always find themselves some diversion in leisure hours. The negative aspect of this is that due to the shortage of spare time, some of the diversions found are not good for them, i e alcohol, drugs. To take care of these poor creatures a whole industry is created in the form of health centres and spas. At these centres the ""guests"" are encouraged to give a free rein to their imaginations and get to know themselves in order to submit to their fates.
Secondly, there is the category of people who need imagination to be able to perform their work, e g designers, architects, artists. Those who have creative jobs have the advantage of being able to unfold their dreams during working-hours. Consequently they do not have any imagination left when they come home after a hard days work. They get bored easily and look for diversions, which they easily find at each other's cocktail-parties. And the result of too frequent partying is a visit to a spa.
Thirdly and finally, there is the category of people who have a balanced degree of imagination divided evenly between working-hours and spare time. This is where the majority of us belongs. The people who keep the society going, pay our taxes and take care of our fellowmen of the other two categories.
To conclude, there are pros and cons with the dominance by technology as it is with so many things. I am certain we do not want to be without it. Imagination will always have its natural place in our modern world. It is only through our imagination that technology and science will find further progress.

Technology and science on the one hand, and imagination and dreams on the other hand are often looked upon as beeing each others opposites. From one point of view, indeed they are, but I would say they are also very closely connected. Imagination beeing a condition of technology. I will try to develop these thoughts a bit further in this essay.
According to this first idea, people can be placed along a horizontal line. Where on this line one is placed is due to the extent that one deals with technology and science compared with imagination. See table 1 below.

As is shown by table 1 we find scientists and people like that at one end of the line and at the other end we find such as actors and painters. The rest of us are placed somewhere in between. Often the two groups at the ends look down on each other. Group A are said to be woolly left-wingers and group B are accused of being anti-social computor freaks with nothing but figures and formulae on their minds.
I think we should just accept that people are different, that some are good with figures and formulae and some have amazing painting skills. The fact is, after all, that we need each other just because we are different. We fill in different gaps that are all necessary to fill. Authors get an enormous help from computors when they write their books and the scientist will probably enjoy reading a novel or seeing a play in his sparetime.
Now I come to the next idea which I presented in the beginning, that technology and imagination are very closely connected. As I said, I think that imagination is a condition of technology. I will explain why.
I think that imagination and dreams are like nutriment for our minds. If we do not have them we will be like living deads. Technology can help us get a more comfortable life but without our imagination and dreams life would be very dull and poor. Because we need more than comfortability in our lives. We need excitement, beauty and something to long for. Our imagination and dreams can give us that. They are a kind of motor in life. They make us want to go on and discover and experience new things. It is because people were curious about other places and planets that aeroplanes and space ships were built. It is the hunger to learn more, not to be content with what we have acchieved sofar, that makes us discover and invent new things. Therefore I think it is clear that without people's dreams, imagination and never-ending need to know more, we would still be living in the stone age.
Unfortunately, not all things we discover are intirely good. Cars for example, makes us mobile in a way that people could not imagine possible less than a hundred years ago, but they also have damaging effects on our environment.
Sometimes I wonder if technology has not gone too far. Knowledge can always be put to an improper use. I think, for example, of nuclear power which has been used to make a bomb powerful enough to kill us all in just a few seconds. Then there is also the medical knowledge. It is wonderful that doctors are now able to cure diseases that were fatal only a few years ago, but this medical knowledge also gives rise to ethical questions about things as artificial insemination and surrogate mothers.
It is very obvious that technology can be a danger if it is not controlled by intelligent and sound minds. Hopefully, our imagination of the dangers of knowing too much will help us to use technology and our scientific knowledge in a way that is good for all of us, and the rest of the earth.
To make a short summary of what I have been trying to say in this essay, technology will never make imagination and dreams unnecessary for two main reasons. First, they are the condition of technology. If people had no imagination nothing would be invented or discovered. Second, imagination and dreams is something we are born with. They are hereditary characters which no one can take away from us. Just as no one can take away our ability to love, and hate. They are a part of us and without them we would not be humans.

Some people say that laziness is the mother of all inventions. I would agree to that if one added curiosity as another feature of inventions. To invent things must include some kind of imaginative and creative process. Inventing things must also include dreaming of a better world or at least a world that is even lazier to live in than before. So to say that science, technology and industrialization would take away all creativity in mankind is to say that all of us living in a modern Western world are content and do not wish for anything more. Most of us want more sparetime and less workhours. I think that most people in this world of ours do dream of changes.
Some of us dream of machines doing all the boring work there is to do and some of us dream of a world without machines. This is of course a conflict situation but it can be solved by a lot if imagination. If we say that the people who do not want any machines do all the work that the other category consider boring then both categories would be satisfied. An arrangement like this would demand a lot of work for the no-machine-wanting category. Let us say for example that a person from the machine-wanting category would want to watch television, but since that is a machine he would not be aloud to do so. Then the other category would have to perform some kind or play or some other kind of entertaining act to satisfy the machine lovers. I think that after a while there would be some creative thoughts about how to be able to entertain a vast number of people with as little effort as possible. Then they would probably come up with something similar to the television. Without even having thought about it they would have invented a machine. That is how all machines are invented, I believe. That is what brought industrialization. And behind and in front of all this lies science. People want to do as much as possible with as little effort as ever possible. People are lazy.
Another imaginative feature that I mentioned in the beginning was curiosity. That is certainly what killed the cat but it is also what made people move out of Africa some long time ago. People have an urge to seek what is unknown to them. As soon as you feel that everything around you is completely familiar to you, then you will seek the borders of your knowledge to see if you can discover something you do not know of. And if you discover such a thing then you will do whatever is in your power to try to understand it. This category of people are certainly not lazy but very idle. Together with the lazy ones they have discovered everything that we now are trying to get a grip on and understand.
So in order to be unaffected and ignorant of the world one would have to live in total isolation. But even if you live in total isolation you would see things thay would start your grey cells working. So then you would have to be blind. But you would still hear things, smell things, taste things and feel things. So if you would like to live in total ignorence and isolation then you would have to be dead or else you would be at least the slightest curios. So live on, live happily and let your senses fill you with things you can not understand.

 It might be hard to see any connection between these two ideologies, but of course technology has its origin in peoples' imagination. Someone must have invented the word technology and what it stands for by using her or his imagination. I do not think the inventor knew that technology - in its complete development - should be a threat to the mental health for millions of human beings. I also do not think the inventor thought that technology could be the master and people its slaves.
We think we know when to stop the development, that we are the masters of the situation, that we know when it is enough. On the contrary, I do not think we know how to stop the wheel of technology. A wheel which spins faster and faster ready to run us all over by killing our imagination.
We are ruled by money and power. Technology is money and also power. The urge for money and power seems to be much stronger than our will to protect our imagination and creative ability. We do not give it a chance to grow in our high scientific society.
The inventor probably saw technology as an help for us to raise our living standard. Well, we succeded in increasing our standard, at least in the industrialized countries, but to what price? The problem is that we forgot how to live without our technical facilities. We depend completely on them. We are not free people. Imagination is, I think, one way out of this constant lack of freedom.
It is said that  If we already have everything, what is the idea of inventing? Presumably, there is no need to use our imagination for the sake of inventing. I think this saying was more relevant in the childhood of modern technology than it is today. Nowadays, the new inventions and the technical development rule our world and peoples' needs. The industry decides what we should wear and use. We do not have to figure it out ourselves.
Technology has often taken our jobs. It is cheaper to have a machine than a well-paid human worker. A machine does not complain, it makes fewer mistakes and it does not have to stay home because of a running nose or a sick child. It does not charge any extra money for working overtime. It does not go on strike for a higher salary. A machine does not think its job is boring or get problem with a worn out body.
People will lose their jobs and get unemployed. Then they probably lose their self-confidence, their hope and accordingly their fantasy and imagination. There is no strengh left for dreaming when you are distressed. If you are not happy, I think it is difficult to have a working sense of imagination.
Consequently, technology can be an evil power. It gives rich contries a reason to rule and oppress other, mostly the poor developing countries. The rich contries see an opportunity to sell expensive technology to poor countries. Often they deliver technical equipments that the users do not know how to use. They do not have the knowledge - or they might not have the need for it either.
Still, I think peoples' imagination is more flourishing in the developing countries where people are not so used to machines that think and create for them. They are not use to computers that serve them everything. The computers do not put a frame for their existence. People have to think and to create themselves. I am sure that folk-songs, legends and myths have a good soil to grow in particulary in these societies. There is no competition between the computer and the human brain.
I do think our modern science, technology and industrialization are a a threat to our dreams and imaginations. There is no place for dreamers. Imagination only grows to its full extent in a society where you really need to think, where imagination is important for surviving. But, I must add that there are people in our modern industrialized world that really create things. I think they are people who constantly search for other values in life. Something with more quality than the surfaced technology, with an healthy effect on our mental harmony. There are thousands of modern artists, writers and everyday-philosophers that make fantastic and unusual pieces of art.
Of course it is more difficult when almost everything already is invented. It is easier just to relax, being uncreative. It is true that people are still dreaming in their sleep even in our modern technical society (without our night-dreams we would probable die of distress), but they do not use it as a creative power.
I do not think we know how important imagination is for our mental life - and also for a working cultural society. Our world would be so much poorer without a human sense and feeling for imagination, fantasy and dreaming -"" the unnecessary gifts"".
Without that gifts there would also be no art, no poems, no books, no theatres, no culture and religion - and definitely no happy persons.

People all over the world have always had dreams and images of different things. These dreams have made it easier to people to live on and they have given people something to strive towards. Though we are nowadays living in a high-technological society, I think we have a place for dreaming and imagination. I even think we have a greater need for them than our ancestors had.
When we talk about dreaming and imagination, we should perhaps start with identifying our meaning of these words. For me dreaming is to have hopes and ideas of a better future - both as to the materalistic and the spiritual world. Imagination is the ability of making up pictures (in your mind) of things that do not exist in reality. I will use these meanings in this essay. The interesting questions are: Do we have a place for dreaming and imagination in our lives? Do they survive in our modern society?
My opinion is that people today dream as much as ever. I do not see why our industrialism should have changed that. To think and dream about improvements-possible or impossible - is a fundamental need for all of us. A society, as the one we have today, perhaps makes us dream even more. Wherever we look we see temptations, things we would like to have. If you cannot buy the thing directly, you start dreaming of it.
Our society also stimulates our spiritual dreams. The world is full of catastrophes and I am sure that we all - whether we are conscious of it or not - have a hope of a happier and more peaceful future. If we did not believe so, we could just as well give up living at once. It is not necessary to look out in the wide world to discover disarters. Many people today are unemployed, cannot afford their previous dwellings and have family problems. Some of these people lose their hopes and dreams and see no other way out but suicide. Without a dream there is no point in living. Dreams are essential - also in the computer society.
Dreams do not only occur in miserable situations. Satisfied people, who already have all important things in life, aim at an even greater happiness. A higher social position, a better employment, more attractive looks, more leisure etc. I only have to look at myself and my friends to realize this.
All the nonconformist communions expanding today, is a sign that people are restless and have no faith in society. If they do not try something religious, they try different kinds of spectacular life philosophies or join a new political party. They expect to get answers to their dreams and hopes. Sometimes they find what they were searching, but many get disappointed and disillusioned. This wander of searching people shows, what I said earlier about a greater need for dreams today.
I find it harder to discuss imagination than dreaming. Perhaps it is impossible to separate these concepts. At least they belong to the same field.
In former days people needed a better imagination than we do in modern society. When they told each other news, stories and fairy-tales, they had to use their imagination since there was no picture to visualize the related. Today we have pictures wherever we look. Photos, picture-books, newspapers, magazines, television, videos, films, advertising etc. We do not need any imagination. Without noticing it we grow passive and dull. This development is caused of the industrialized society. There has become limited space for images.
It is too much, however, to say that we live without images today. Imagination - like dreaming - is something fundamental and always present in our minds. When we for example talk on the phone we imagine a picture of the person we are talking to and the things he/she is telling us. It is the same thing when we read a novel without illustration. And after we have seen a really good film, we start thinking of a possible continuation of it. We make up pictures in our minds. In one way images are dreams (and vice versa). The images are often shaped after our dreams and wishes.
Finally I want to stress the importance of both dreaming and imagination. The need for them exist and there certainly is a place for them. The industrialized society may affect us in many ways, but it can never deprive us of our inner thoughts and ideas.

A friend of mine some year or so ago said:  What she meant was that the future - as the concept of which we used to associate it with - has more or less sneaked up on us and here, all of a sudden, we are. Right in the middle of it. The friend who said it is of a rather artistic/philosophic nature, which perhaps explains her utter surprise of the really existing fact that ""the Future"" at last has arrived.
The fact that she has an artistic/philosophic mind is perhaps important to emphazise the contrast between the more ""organic"" intelligence of humanbeings compared to the ""synthetic"", or as it is labelled in some areas; ""artificial intelligence"", of machines. The fear that computers, robots and machines would conspire and in a gigantic mutiny overthrow the humanbeing, make the human-power inferior to the artificial and the people slaves to the machines, is a much portrayed proto-type-prejudice. One of the most known novels to establish this fear is Aldous Huxley s ""Brave New World"". The latest contribution to the common fears of what technology can do, which almost everyone agrees to is wrong, is the film ""Jurassic Park"" where advanced genetechnology makes it possible to resurrect the old lizards who vanished from the face of the earth some 50 to 60 million years ago.
Those are fearfull thoughts of what technology can do that is wrong. There is however as usual two sides of the coin. On the other side is progress within scientfical, medical, cultural, and other areas. The usage of technology to simplify and improve.
Which side of the coin that should come up is up to us; the humanbeings. It is up to our common sense to see to that technology never will replace ""the organic feeling"" totally. That it should be a mere complement to human achievements in whatever area it is used.
We have a moral obligation to maintain the aesthetical/sensuous aspect in creativity and not let the analythical/technological one get to rule completely. They might be combined - as they are now in many ""cultural areas"" with word processors, computers with holographical, virtual realities, and so on - but shouldn't be treated as competitors in a game of which one we need the best (with the intention of neutralizing the other one). If we completely excluded imagination - dreams, poetry, films, music, etc - then we would also exclude the human factor; the soul. We would be transformed into machines - ""they"" would have won. If we completely excluded technology we would be transferred back to the l9th century - which some perhaps would consider to be better - but then we would also lose our comfortable and convenient way of living.
So the main-principle would therefore be that technology is goood as an industrial assistant but can never fully replace the human touch.
William Burroughs once reflected upon the human race and our chances of survival. His opinion was that if we don t blow this planet to smithereens, we would for sure colonize the moon. He also suggested that the sensibility-perception would be a main-ingredient in avoiding destruction and therefore should be cultivated right from the start; he wanted schoolkids to become familiar with expressing themselves via the usage of language. That it should be obligatory with prose and poetry from an early age.
Of course one could use word-processors in this modelling. As long as it was presented in the right way; it s all about communication between people. The future will be very cerebral and here lies a great responsibility for the humanities, the arts. We must see that the human conscousness and spirit also follows the rest of the human mind into the 21st century.
So perhaps my good friend was right; the future is here now. We are the future respecting the past.

There is a growing notion in the world today that technology is a Bad Thing and that an increasing emphasis put on technology and science prevents people, and particularly the younger generation, from dreaming and turns them into numb robots and computer addicts. In this essay, I want to show that this is an unfounded and gratuitous fear, provided that we learn to use technology in order to serve our own interests and for the benefit of mankind.
The fear of technology is founded on the fact that many people simply don't understand it, and what's worse, they don't bother to even try to understand it. They feel alienated from ""the whole thing"", meaning, the technological system on which the whole of our modern society is based, and they nurture a constant longing for the past when life wasn't so complicated.
This clash between Art and Science is wonderfully explained in Robert M. Pirsig's book, ""Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance"" and he continues by dividing human understanding into two kinds -  versus  According to him, a person with a romantic view of life sees things  in other words, he or she sees only the surface. Mechanical drawings or computer manuals are to a romantic nothing but  	The classical person, on the other hand, sees the  behind the seemingly incomprehensible lines and figures. He - or she - manages to see the potentials hidden in technology and makes use of it instead of condemning and fleeing from it.
The problem is to unite the technologists and the romantics in the world. We have to make the technologists more human and aware of what really matters - the preserving of the earth and the social - not economic! - welfare of all people. As for the romantics, who, with their creativity and intuition have a great advantage over the tehnologists, they must learn to value technology, because without it, they wouldn't survive a day. Or as Pirsig puts it;  	It is argued that technology causes pollution of the sea, destroys the earth and dilutes the atmosphere and therefore must be fighted. Environmentalists often point at the irreparable ecological mistakes made by our parents in the 40s, 50s and 60s which our generation will have to live with for a long time. For example, the enthusiastic ""powdering of PCB, DDT and other toxic substances to fight vermin, has only recently begun to show its horrible consequences on animal and vegetable life.
My point, however, and again I will have to quote Pirsig, is that  In other words, if we can create machines to destroy our planet, we can also create machines and methods to save it.
The heart of the matter is that technology is no danger to us, if we learn how to use it rightly! Our aim should be to  as Henry David Thoreau - a true man of vision - asserted in his book 'Walden' as early as 1854. Instead of fearing technological progress, we should benefit from it and use it to fight poverty and disease and to build environmentally friendly plants and means of transportation. Furthermore, by means of our intelligence and technological knowledge, we can construct machines which can take over the dangerous and unhealthy jobs, thus giving us more freedom and leisure time.
Not until the basic needs of all people - clean water, food, shelter and piece of mind - are obtained, can we find our Utopia, a true Heaven on Earth, where the importance of Dreaming and Imagination is understood and finally given the place it deserves.

Some people hold that there is no longer a place for dreaming and imagination in our modern society. Sadly, I must admit that I agree with them.
From my point of view, the deprivation of imagination starts already in early childhood. Parents buy ready-made and elaborate toys for their kids, instead of encouraging them to create their own. The children get used to being provided with playthings and thus gradually lose their power of initiative and inventiveness. I also believe that television can have devastating effects on children. Today a lot of kids prefer watching television to playing games or reading books. I fear that this development will deteriorate their creativity and reading ability even more.
Since efficiency and productivity are maxims of our society, there is no time and space for imagination in people's professional lifes either. A case in point is the situation of the industrial workers. Not only have they got monotonous and stressful jobs, they have also been deprived of the creative satisfaction and pleasure of manufacturing. In our society the pursuit of profit is considered far more important than creating stimulating jobs.
It is also disquieting that we have become so dependent on scientific expertise. An illuminating example is our faith in Western medicine. In former times people believed in knowledge based on experience; today everything has to be scientifically proved. Is medicine made by artificial means more reliable than Nature's own resources? I don't think the women used Thalidomide in the 60s would agree with that. As far as I am concerned, it's a con, and behind it is the pharmaceutical industry, trying to manipulate people in order to make more money. Thus a lot of innocent people are being deceived and prevented from using their own intuition and imagination when it comes to healing.
Finally, as for dreaming, some people might claim that it is not possible to deprive a person of his dreams. i venture to say that it is. Mass media and the advertising industry are constantly trying to influence and form our dreams. They decide how to dress, what to eat, how to furnish homes, where to go on vacation; they even decide what kind of friends and partners you should have and how they should look and behave in order to please you. Eventually you get so confused that your no longer know of your choices and values are your own or if they have been affected by the advertising industry.
To sum up: I don't believe there is a place for dreaming and imagination in this vacuous society of ours, and I doubt there will even be one if we don't stop submitting to this oppression of our spiritual needs. Only when we cease living up to society's expectations will we be able to fulfill ourselves.

Albert Einstein once stated:  (in On Science). I interpret ""knowledge"" in this statment to be equal to technology. I believe that technology prevent humans' ability to use their imagination. In this essay I will only look upon one single piece of technology that in various ways has destroyed millions of people's sense of imagination. I am refering to the terrible, brain-washing, electricity-eating and worst weapon of destruction against imagination that I can think of: THE TELEVISION SET.
Some people claim that literature is dead. People in general does not read anymore. They watch TV instead. In a TV program the director has already thougth about dress, looks, sounds and surroundings for you. All you have to do is open your eyes. In a book you might be given some descriptions, but in good literature there are always gaps in the text that the reader fill in with his/her own imagination (Wolfgang Iser, a reader-response critique's theory). This process of using the imagination makes the reader learn something about his/her own ability to be creative as well as using his/her experiences.
If you watch a TV program you just sit there like a stupified receiver. Information pours into your brain. You have no chance to stop and ponder or reread something like one can when reading a book. Some literary works like novels by Dostojevskij require the reader to not only read but to think. You put the book a away for awhile, think, then go back to the text with a better understanding. I have to admit that all TV programs not are trash but I estimate that about 90% of them are.
There are also other aspects to why TV kills imagination. What would you do if you didn't have a TV? You would have a lot of time that you could employ your creative imagination to come up with ideas for recreation. You might build a boat, write a book, knit a sweater, learn how to parachute or become an English professor, i.e. the are innumerable possibilites. My opinion is that TV steals time from people. This time they could use to achieve many things and expand their ability to use their imagination.
Most of my comtemporaries are dependent on TV with its game shows and soap operas. I claim that by reading good literature one will get satisfaction from spending one's time with quality. Many people watch TV for too many hours a week. This time they could use to make the world a better place to live in. At first they could improve their personal lives by using their imagiation to achieve things they maybe never thought they could do. Then as they continue to expand their limits they may be able to interact with other people and influence them to reduce their hours of TV watching. Even though technology has immensely improved many aspects of life for humanity, I still claim that when it concerns the TV set I think this piece of technology has become misused in a way that more hinder than help mankind.

In the beginning man was nothing more than a quarrelsome animal which had the ability to speak and think but did not exhaust himself in doing either.
Then one glorious day, one man invented the wheel and although his neighbours probably complained about his usage of the sacred symbol of the sun, he kept using his invention and one by one his neighbours became convinced of the advantages of the wheel.
Many thousand years later the first cars began to use the roads in Europe. In some countries legislation forced the driver to have a man with a red flag walk ahead of the car to warn the road-users.
Nowadays, some people say that in our modern world, dominated by science, technology and industrialization, there is no longer a place for dreaming and imagination. But that complaint is totally irrelevant. Imagination has given us technology and science and they have in turn furnished us with time saving gadgets, fastfood, nuclear power-plants and genetically manipulated tomatoes-to name only a few inventions. These inventions have two side-effects, the first is that we have more time to dream if that is how we elect to spend the time we have saved and secondly, imagination has become more important than ever in almost every line of business.
Furthermore, technology provides us with a large portion of the stuff that dreams are made of, for example: in the film Jurassic Park technology both makes it possible for us to get an idea of how dinosaurs looked like and it also gives us the reason to believe that the resurrection of the dinosaurs really could be done, which is half the thrill of the film.
Technology can also be used to make our dreams come true by finding cures for diseases which cannot yet be cured, and many other things which we only have to conceive to realize. As a character says in Vonnegut's Cat's Cradle:  In a wider perspective technology may be seen as our only realistic way of achieving a kind of eternal life, of course not for ourselves but for the intelligent robots we might produce in the future and thereby continuing the evolution that created us.
Unfortunately, technology does have its drawbacks, especially when it is handled carelessly as in Chernobyl or viciously as in Nagasaki, but it is not technology in itself that threaten us, it is the inherent malevolence in each of us. If there were no weapons we would be killing each other with toothpicks-if there is a will we have always had a knack of finding a way! It seems as if imagination is a bigger threat to humanity than technology is.
Still, there is the question of industrialization, a thing that frightened people at the end of the 19th century, because the machines took their jobs and often made their places of work perilous since safety routines were non-existent at that time.
However, nowadays industrialization only takes away boring and unhealthy jobs and if anyone complains about that, it is because he is in urgent need of money and not because he likes the job.
Accidentally, this brings to my mind the technocrats, who during the 30s, 40s and 50s had a persisting dream to replace bank managers, civil servants and other bureaucrats with impartial, logical and unselfish robots that would do their job swiftly and efficiently and with little cost to the tax-payers. It is a beautiful idea that certainly deserves to be tested.

In a world dominated by technology, science and industrialization some people think that there is hardly no place at all for dreaming* and imagination. They claim that technology has a checking effect on dreams and imagination. But there are from my point of view less things supporting than opposing this theory.
Technology and science has originally come from peoples' dreams and their ability to imagine things. Take for example the aeroplane. People have been dreaming of flying for centuries, and they have tried to invent wings for just as long. Finally someone invented an aeroplane. And the dream grew bigger and today we can even walk on the mon, all just because of an old dream. Most inventions, I guess, have been developed like this.
Nowadays people have everything, some people say, but if we did there would be no more inventions, and there defenately are. There are new inventions every day, big or small, and I do not think there would be if we did not dream anylonger.
Thanks to modern technology we can today share our wildest imaginations and take part of others' with the help of for example films, music-videos or pictures. A hundred years ago there was no such way of showing one another personal thoughts like that even if they wanted to. Today we can do that(with the help of for example special effects), thanks to technology and science.
Dreams are something that nothing or nobody can stop, I think. People will keep on dreaming what ever happens. There is for example an apparent piece of evidence which proves this: lottery. A lottery works well no matter what times are like. In fact there seems to be more people betting on different lotteries when times are rough than during good times. People dream of becoming millionaires; of traveling around the world; of having a new car and so on, and that has nothing to do with technology or science. We have been dreaming of the same things for ages, but nowadays there is a bigger chance of these kinds of dreams coming true. It is easier and not so expensive to travel or to get a new car today than it was for about a hundres years ago.
I have known people who are afraid that people of today, especially children, do not think enough by themselves. They think that for example video-games or computer-games are dangerous for their childrens' minds, and they think that their imagination will stop developing. Others think that these sorts of games are helping our imagination to develop There are actually no evidence at all that they are not imagining as much when they play video-games as when they play with dolls or with toy-cars.
Even though I agree with the later statement I would like to add that imagination and dreams have to be nourished, not to survive but to develop. They have to be nourished not only by watching films, reading comic-books, playing video-games or such things, but also by reading books.

Technology is given a lot of space in modern society. Almost everything we do in our daily lives is computerized and in other ways simplified by the use of technology. It may seem that we do not have to use our imagination anymore, that there is no place for dreams and imagination. Is technology slowly killing our ability to imagine and dream?
To imagine and to dream are essential qualities in human beings. People have always been able to imagine and to dream. Some people are using their imagination to try to improve their lives or at least make their lives endurable. To imagine a better life often encourage people to create a better life. It is all in the state of mind. Other people lose themselves in day-dreams to escape their ordinary lives for a while. Until the twentieth century mankind had, in some ways, more time for dreams and imagination. Life was lived in a slower pace, since everything took so much longer time to do. Most people also lived closer to nature. Farmers, for example, who had not only time to dream, but also the perfect environment for dreaming. On the other hand, people who worked long hours slaving away in factories or hot kitchens, did not have much opportunity to dream. They were probably too tired to dream.
Technology makes it possible to perform monotonous and tedious work faster and thus leaves us more time for imagination and dreams. With technology, working-hours have been shortened and daily chores as shopping, housework and cooking do not take up the whole day. This gives everybody more time to spend as they wish. More time makes people more relaxed and in that way gives them the energy needed for dreams and imagination. One example, where technology has really improved our chances to imagine and dream more, is the library. It is now possible to search for books using a computer, instead of using a cardindex or searching on the bookshelves. Now you can find the books you want fast and see if they are lent. Most of the time you will find much more than you were looking for. In this case, technology gives us time to enjoy the books we want to read and as we all know, reading gets your imagination going.
Will technology slowly kill our ability to imagine and dream? My answer is: no! Technology will instead give people more time for imagination and dreams. People will be more creative, because they will have the tools which simplifies all the time-consuming work. There cannot be any major danger that we will stop dreaming and imagining, because if we do, mankind will die out.

Some people think that it is impossible to combine technology and imagination and that we have to choose between these two elements. Why? Is it necessary? Do we really have to choose?
No, I don't think so. I think we must see them, not as one, but side by side helping each other. In this essay I will try to explain why I have this opinion.
How did technology evolve? Well, the very simple answer is: from imagination. A long time ago someone, like Leonardo da Vinci, sat thinking and dreaming about different problems, for example how to fly. So what did he do? He took a pen and a piece of paper and started to sketch down his thoughts and whatever that came to his mind. In that way he developed new technology with the help of both his imagination and old technology, in this case the pen and the piece of paper. This is a good example of technology and imagination co-operating. He used technology as a way to speed up the realization of his imaginative thoughts.
Today we are doing the same. As da Vinci, we are trying to realize our dreams with the help of technology, but today we are using computers.
Do we then have a place for dreaming and imagination in our modern world? Yes, we have, definitely!
I am especially thinking of one line of business where you must use both your fantasy and the latest in technology. What I am talking about is the business of imagination, the film industry.
Some of the methods and technics the film industry use for various special effects are morphing, digital picture processing and high speed cameras. Take for example Michael Jackson's videos, what would they have looked like without the help of computers and their abilities of handling large quantities of data? One of the effects he uses frequently is morphing, which means gradually transforming from one picture to another.
In movies like Jurassic Park and Terminator 2 the directors have managed to visualize their imaginations by using the best of modern technics.
Another interesting area is Virtual Reality. This is a computer simulation where you can walk around in a landscape or a building that doesn't really exist. Architects, city planners and other designers have here a great tool for adding one more dimension to their creative minds.
Video and computer games are technics that really fire people's imagination. In a video game one can experience any possible scenario or dream that comes to one's mind. Take for example flying, anyone that ever has dreamed about flying, can now try to make a loop with a Boeing 747 from the safety of the livingroom chair.
Music and art have always been created in a conventional way, using pencils and pieces of paper. Nowadays music comes from computers, synthesizers and samplers. These inventions really inspire and simplify the creative process of composing. A new form of art has developed from computers, using their graphic abilities to create for example fractal landscapes or make realistic looking pictures.
All these examples show that technological achievements don't interfere with fantasy and imagination, instead they co-operate. In the future this co-operation will expand and this is a necessity if the human being will improve in all areas.
So in other words: Yes, I definitely think that imagination has a place in our modern world.

It might be a hash world we are living in. In many respects it is extremely impersonal. We only have to think of in how many of our everyday confrontations with society we deal with machines where people used to deal with fellow-beings. Technology keeps sending us farther and farther away from each other, since we can manage fine in life with our ""fellow-machines"" and do not have to depend on other humans as much. Some people might be of the opinion that all that counts in life is science and pure facts, and that dreaming and imagination belong to bygone days. These people I am apt to call pessimists. they are wrong. I am willing to admit that dreaming and fantasizing may seem more abstract that it used to, but it has never ever been more important than it is in the highly technological society of today.
From a scientific and technological point of view it would be a disaster if people were to stop dreaming - science and technological devices are nothing bit the fruit of people's dreams and imaginations. How could we invent new things if we did not fantasize about things not yet existing? However, even more important is dreaming seen from a more personal point of view. Everybody needs to dream. It is vital in order to be able to lead a rich life, I think. Dreaming and fantasizing is the ground on which we all build our hopes and if we did not have hope we would not have the motivation nor the strength to live. Still, I know, there might be those who say that science, technology and industrialization leave no place for dreaming. I do not agree. I would say we are more apt to dream on now than ever before, since hope is the last thing we tend to give up. If society does not stimulate our imagination and appears altogether dull, gray and hectic we automatically try to create something more interesting and restful in our minds. As for myself dreaming is like an oasis in the desert; a place where I can rest and revive my soul. I think that just like our bodies need nutrition in order to stay healthy, our souls need to be fed too. Dreaming and fantasizing is the kind of food that satisfies the soul, I think.
In what ways have science and technology affected us, then, considering dreams and imagination? Has it affected us at all? I would say that it has. We may not use our imagination less than before, but I think it serves a different purpose now than it used to do. I think dreaming used to be a more natural part of people's lives when people did not know as much about the world around them as we do now. There were so many mysteries about life and so many unanswered questions. The answers needed were found in people's imagination, I think. Nowadays, however, science gives us so many answers, even to the most complicated of questions, that imagination does not have to do that any longer. Today imagination is asking questions rather that answering them. Our imagination creates the mysteries we could not live without.
Technology and imagination is a well-matched couple walking hand in hand along the path of life. They are different, but they complement each other and they would both seem lost and deserted on their own.

Today we are living in a world full of technology. Technology that is moving forward all the time, and that keeps bringing us new ""miraculous"" things. The question is do we really need everything that it brings us, and what does this technology do to our minds, hopes and dreams?
People living in the last decade of the 20th century are constantly being exposed to modern technology. We are so used to some of the things it has brought us that we don't really think about them as products of the modern technology any longer. The fax, the mobiletelephone and the microwave oven are just some of the products being used daily throughout the Western World. These things haven't been out on the market for that long, but still people would probably find it difficult to do without them.
The industrial civilization is spoilt, and has been brought up to consume things, and to take advantage of modern technology. But do we really need all the things it brings us? The answer to that question is no. We don't need all of it. Modern technology does not bring us complete happiness and it does not help us to forfill all our dreams. I seriously believe that quite the opposite is true. People are being robbed of their imagination. Now we don't have to dream about doing things like bungee-jumping for example, because we can experience the jump with virtual reality. Neither do we need to go and see our friends or relatives because we can just as easily phone them up. And soon people will have access to telephones which can transfer pictures as well, which means we can see the person as well as talk to him. I think we do need some of the new technology that is out on the market, but we need far from all of it. Technology developed to actually help people should be encouraged, but the rest of it should be restricted.
People need to have lives that are not being controlled by the ""wonderful"" 20th century technology. People need to be allowed to use their own imagination, and to feel and experience natural sensations - not some digital ones. This is one of the reasons why so many people are having psychological problems. We are simply drowning under all the modern things. We are not ready for all the new products that is pouring over us. We simply can't adjust to this new and fast-moving society, and that is why crime-rate is rising, and why more and more people are taking drugs - everything to escape the reality of the modern world. A world that is changing way to rapidly for people to get a grip of it and to find happiness in it. We need to slow down and look at what we really need, and that should be our one goal with developing technology.

The science and technology of the 20th century have made it possible to study and explore the world we live in from the minute parts of an atom to enormous cosmic phenomena such as supernovas and black holes. This knowledge has helped us understand how the universe works and made our lives easier by preventing disease and famine in many parts of the world. Our understanding of the world has made us re-think the way we look at it. Things that were previously regarded with fear and superstition are put in a context which make them understandable and natural. But perhaps modern science has also taken away some of the magic and mystique of our world. Maybe our increasing knowledge of things has made our world a smaller and duller place to live in.
The author Samuel Clemens, better known as Mark Twain, spent a large part of his childhood during the mid 19th century in the small town of Hannibal, close to the Mississippi river. To the young Clemens the great Mississippi river represented beauty and excitement; his greatest childhood dream was to work on one of the river boats that were sailing on the Mississippi. After a series of odd jobs he managed to fulfil his dream and became a river pilot. Later in his life Samuel Clemens described this choice of career as a big mistake. No longer would the Mississippi be the romantic and exciting place of his childhood, instead he know saw it with the professional eyes of a trained river pilot. The river had been transformed from a fantasy inspiring playground to a workplace where everything had to be evaluated and measured. Maybe we all lose something when we get our romantic impressions altered by changes in our life.
Does this mean that knowledge and experiences destroy our dreams, and that we in this technological age are entering an era where there is no place for dreams and imagination; a time when everything is explained and analysed into insipid familiarity? Personally I think that if there is anything that is losing ground in today's society, it is reality.
Science has been able to explain to us the way things work, unfortunately this is not the way most of us would like it to work. We know that the world's energy resources are not inexhaustable, that faster-than-light speed is not possible and that our current way of life is destroying our planet. But knowing this has not made us less inclined to dream of things that cannot be, or imagine how thing could be if the impossible was possible. People's need to escape reality has not diminished with time, and never before have people had such a wide variety of ready-made escape routes available to them. Science and technology have provided us with designer drugs, computer games and cable TV with quintillions of channels.
Technology and scientific progress have not changed peoples need for dreams and imagination, or made it harder for them to create dreams or use their imagination. However, the form of the dreams or fantasies have changed; gnomes and trolls have been replaced by aliens and UFOs. The increasing specialisation has made it harder for laymen to understand the theories behind the scientific advances, and the scientist has become to be regarded as modern day magicians: doing things very few people understand and accomplishing amazing results The dreams and imaginations of men and women will change with the time they live in, but I am convinced that no matter what society look lik people will always make a place for dreams and imagination.

Technology The idea What do we actually mean by science and technology? Many people associate very different things with science and two persons can disagree strongly on if science is good or bad but if the asked one another what they actually meant by science the might find that the totally agree. So what is science. We tend to consider new techniques and new ideas as science and technology. But all the old inventions from the wheel and the steam machine to the development of space crafts and modern computer systems are all science and technology. The only difference is the amount of knowledge available at the time of the invention.
What is good technology?
This is something that varies in time. Today e.g. one often hear that good technology has to be clean, whatever you mean by that, which is a rather new criteria. I would say that the best criteria for good technology is that; it helps you to do something you want to do, or makes you want to do it.
What is bad technology?
You can subdivide this group in to two groups. Firstly, the technology which doesn't fulfil your demands; secondly, the ones that cause nature and/or other people damage.
Imagination Do we need to dream?
There are books on dreams and visions but to put it short: if we have no imagination no visions we will only float along, maybe content with things as they are. If this had been our way from the beginning we had probably never left the trees.
Dreaming can on the other hand mean that you only search inside your self and screen of the rest of the world. I believe that that dreams are very important to us but we can not live with out visions..
Bad dreams All visions are not good. Had not Hitler, Khomein and have not Sadam Hussein all visions. They dreamt/dream of a ""better"" world, most unfortunately for some and not very good for most.
Technology and Imagination Good examples The users of computers in the arts: music, painting; games, can hardly be accused for lacking imagination. Even if some of the computer games makes you feel like you have ended up in a nightmare. There is a vast amount of programs where only your imagination limits what you can do. Without great visions we had never develop the technology for space travels and at the same time made a giant leap in computer technology. Something we still benefit from today.
Bad examples In most cases, the misuse of technology is closely connected to the ""need"" of making a profit. In other words someone wants to make money and let others pay the price. Technology can hardly be blamed for the folly of man.
Conclusion Technology is not good or bad it is how you use it that makes the result positive or negative. Technology can enhance our capability of imagination and perhaps give us more time to dream. We should not ask what is good technology and what is bad but what do we want? Then; if it is more spare time, more money or what ever; we turn to technology. The problem is as always if you do not know what you want you will most certainly not get it.

SWUL6004,2.5,2.5,,,,,Feminists have done more harm to the cause of women than good,"
How do we obtain a society with equality, not only in terms of the freedom of religion and the same legal rights for people of different colours and different sexes, but also in everyday life? I will here focus on the sex equality. There are a number of different ways to proceed in this work. One way is the feminists' way, by trying to build a wall between sexes and to accuse the men for the history. To say to a man that he as a man is responsible for all evil that men have done and do, with sexual abuse, war and violence, will not help anybody. Even if the feminists might not think that they really accuse the single man, I know men that feel accused for what other men have done, but do not feel more responsible for that than any woman. Instead, they themselves feel trapped in a role that they have not chosen, like many women feel this way. Therefore, I feel that in some respects the feminists have done harm to the cause of women, even if they by doing this have focused the problem, which of course is of importance.
Even if the feminists' way was the right to start with, to make people aware of the problem, their way is not the right anymore. I don't feel that it is leading to my goal in this question. My goal is to get mutual understanding and respect between people, independent of sex. For me, it is important not only that women get the same chance in working life, but also that men get the chance to take care of their children. In this chance is of course also a responsibility for women as well as men. Women have to take and get responsibility at work and dare to take the chance when for example offered to be promoted. This includes that the other women at the workplace support the woman that dared instead of saying that she is not good enough, because I think that there are higher demands on women than on men in the same position. It also includes that men accept women as bosses and accept to give them responsibility as well as pay them the same salary as they pay men with equal work. At the same time, men have to take more responsibility for the every day things in a household. This is a question of women letting the men take the responsibility as well as a question of the men taking it. If we respect each other as equal and try to help each other and to take responsibility in all aspects of life, I think it will do good to the cause of women as well as the cause of men.

SWUL6005,3.0,3.5,,,,,The prison system is outdated. No civilized society should punish its criminals: it should rehabilitate them,"
Does a prisonial punishment make criminals change their ways? Do the first time criminal use the time in prison to think over his life, and leave the business of crime? I do not think so! I think that, in general, the one place where you can learn to be a criminal, for life, is in prison. Society should rehabilitate criminals, not put them into a place where they learn from others, more experienced, criminals that crime does pay. Where their messy lives become more messy, and where their chances to form for themselves a decent life decrease.
So, what should we do instead? I think that there must be some sort of punishment left. I think that people must know that if they commit crime, they will suffer for it. But the most important thing here is that, in the punishment, there must be a means of giving the people being punished hope for the future. They must be taught that there are better ways of living. Other paths to follow. That all humans have a value as individuals, be they criminals or not. As part of a punishment, or whatever we should call it, there must be education and therapy. The one major task of a punishment, or rehabilitation, must be to make people not returning to a life of crime.
Many of the prisoners of today did not finish school. They may not have an education that gives them the opportunity to do anything else than commit crime to make a living. They have probably not an education that have taught them the values of life, and the values of other humans and other peoples integrity and rights. Note that education need not mean education of school but education of life. Education of a life the prisoner have not lived!
Many of our criminals have probably psychological problems, such as low self confidence and depression. They have probably sociological problems such as low confidence in society and authorities and problems in the intercourse with other humans. Time in prison, or whatever institution handling the punishment, should include lots of social activities. Prisoners should be able to talk, as often as they want or need, to ""professional friends"", such as psychologists and priests. They should be able to, and maybe forced to, discuss their lives with other criminals and perhaps more important: with ex criminals, that can show them that a way out of crime is possible, and preferable. I think that there is one group of criminals that society have to keep away from the streets. And that group are the humans that commit crime because they suffer from a psychical disorder. Within this group we find serial murderers and sex criminals. Since a sick person do not realize that the deed he has done is a criminal offense, we have to put such a person under medical treatment, and sad as it may be, keep him locked in until he is declared free from his mental disorder. A thing that may not ever happen, for people with severe disorders.

How can one say that feminists, who fight for the rights of women and against all kinds of discrimination against women, have any harm at all to women?
If it weren't for feminists, women would probably still not have the right to vote or to decide over their own bodies, to mention only these two issues. Today we find it ridiculous that women, half the population, should not be allowed to vote. And what about their own bodies? Well, not too long ago, during the 70s I think, a woman could still be raped by her husband and that was not a crime, in Sweden.
In my opinion, we still have some way to go regarding the freedom of women. It makes me furious when I hear how young girls and women are insulted and mistreated because of their sex, their looks, their way to behave and dress. ""She was asking for it."" - words to explain why a young man has harassed a young woman. Can it ever be OK to hurt somebody? That day will come when women will be able to walk home at night without fear of being molested. However, things don't change by themselves. You have to point out where the problems are to those who can't see them. That is why we still need feminists to do that.
It's definitely my opinion that equality between men and women, when it comes to the same possibilities for both sexes to make choices in life, has not been reached yet. More important is that we must not take for granted the gains in ""equality up to this date. Human rights and democracy must be fought for. The debate must continue. The awareness must be transmitted from generation to generation.
An example to illustrate: A couple, a man and a woman, with small children. Both parents want to work on their careers. Who is likely to stay home with the small children? Do they actually have the same possibility to choose as we think they do?
Let's say both parents are offered fantastic jobs. Who will take the responsibility for the children?
Nowadays it's unfortunately not only the echo from our parents' generation which speaks of the natural thing about being a woman, which says that it's natural for a woman to take care of the children. This has been the tradition and female role for generations. This means that being a woman implies following convention and tradition, to stay Woman. Then, if you don't take care of the children, you choose your career instead, you are not a woman, in that sense.
I couldn't disagree more. We need feminists, men and women, to keep this debate alive, to keep a look-out for when the winds are changing, because in the end, this is a matter of human rights and discrimination. We all need to be awakened now and then.

SWUV3008,1.0,2.5,,,,,"In the words of the old song: ""Money is the root of all evil""","
Money is necessary to survive. That is a fact in today's society. Money can do a lot of good We need money to buy clothes, and food for ourselves and our families. Money can help us pursue our dreams and travel around the world, in the hope that with a greater understanding of other cultures we can hopefully be able to avoid conflicts. This is not all, in return for money we can get medical aid and send a letter from one part of the country to another. Sending money to charity organisations is an easy way for us to help people in need, who lack all that which we in the West take for granted. We can also buy fancy cars and have plastic surgery to make us look better and to make us more attractive for the opposite sex. We can buy swimming pools or spend money on Beluga caviar. This is where the problem begins. When you have money you can buy beautiful, expensive items to impress your friends. However, they, in turn, will also try to make as much money as possible to become even more rich, more powerful and to be able to be looked up at by more and more people. Greed is known as one of the mortal sins, and it is fairly easy to understand why. If everyone could make as much money as they wanted to, its value would quickly be lost, which is why the amount of pounds, dollars and yens in the world hardly changes. Thus in order to get really, really rich, you have to get your money from someone else. In our greed we look the other way while the earth's natural resources are depleted, the rain forest destroyed and the polar ice melts, only because we simply must have that mahogany desk since it would go so well with the wallpapers, and because we would not look half as attractive if we tried to survive without the hair spray containers. The fact that they contain CFC:s is of no greater importance. Unfortunately, what we seem to have forgotten in our hunt for money, and the power that comes with it, is that the most valuable commodity of them all is the one that we walk on every day. That is right; Earth. So far, we have not managed to invent a way to leave this planet to settle on another one, once this one has been completely destroyed. So until we have found a way to evacuate the entire population of earth, we ought perhaps to think twice about what we are spending our money on and how that item can help, not only ourselves but Mother Earth.

When we take a money in our hand and look at it, we see that it is only a paper made of wood like the other papers, but this paper is somehow different from the others as it is the key of everything in today's life.
You can do almost everything with money: You are more beautiful, more powerful, more good-hearted, more healthy etc... if you have MONEY. Shortly, you are the best,, if you have money and ""the worst"" if not. Now, let's explain the factor that I range above;
Whether you are an ugly person or not isn't important if you have money because you can change almost every part of your part of your body with the esthetic operations. For example; you have a very big nose and it makes you seem ugly, don't worry! Your nose will be one of the best noses in the world within a week by making esthetic operations. Or, you are very fat and can't loose weight whatever you do, because you can't stand the meals and eat a lot, again don't worry because you will be very thin in a very short time as your money will do everything for you to make you be thinner. As you see you are a very beautiful person now and seem like models. If you want to change another part of your body , only call your money, it will always serve you in condition that its amount stays the same or increase. Also, you are the most powerful person because you are rich, you have the key of everything 
in your hand which is called "" Money. "" For example; you can live in a house in which all the people want to live but can't and have a car which the poor even can't see in their dreams, also you wear the best clothes, eat the best things, go to the best places. In short , you are the best, the most powerful and it is very well known that "" money "" brings you this power as it opens all the locked doors.
Moreover, you are the best-hearted person in the world because you have ""MONEY "" and you are the only person that the others can benefit from you not the poor as poors' heart can' t give anything to others expect their friendship, so,, your money makes you to have a good heart itself.
Also, if you have money, it means that you have another luck which is more important than the other factor because you can be much more healthier and live longer than the others by means of your money as you don't have to wait for days to be checked when you are ill like the poor people on contrast doctors will wait you to come to their special hospitals and check you in the best way because you have the most important thing in the world : MONEY. But money can' t do anything to the poor people as it isn't available for them so, they have to die earlier than the rich people.
Consequently, you can do almost everything with your money and because of the factors that I range above, people can do all evil to get money for as they want to do the same things and live in the same conditions like the rich people. For instance, Let's think a man with two children who doesn't have any Job. Doesn't he want. to buy the things that his children want. Of course, he wants and I'm sure that the thought of ,, lack of money ,, is always in his mind , but he can't do anything as nothing is in his hands. He continues to live with suffering until he stands. But one day he can't stand anymore and steal money from the place he works or kills a person for money because he understands that he has no other way as everything can be done with "" it."" 
Consequently, I can say that this paper which is called money becomes the most important thing in our life as we can't do anything without it. So, people try to make more and more money to live a better life as to have better life means "" MONEY.""

Money is a coin or a printed note which is given and accepted when buying and selling. It looks like a little, worthless thing but in fact it is one of the most important things in our lives. All the time we work in order to get it.
It is obvious that we can not live without it so we have to earn it. This is okay if we earn enough to continue our lives. But what will happen if we always want more? It is like this for most of the people. They always want a better life and money is necessary for this. On the other hand we know that there is no limit for better life. So when someone gets the pleasure of earning he want more and more. He can not stop himself. Then the trouble begins at this point.
Money changes people too much. People start to be strangers to themselves and to each other. Also if it is about money you can not recognize even your best friend, or maybe yourself. Since your main goal is to get more money you can do everything for it. You begin to commit crimes like stealing, counterfeiting, deceiving the government. One day you find yourself in such a position that you can do anything against law even the worst crimes. Sometimes people are murdered, sometimes children are kidnapped. Then time by time money changes you into an evil. As for this people money is their master and they are unconsciously going to be the slaves of it. It possess your personality. As an example it is like an emperor who forces his people to do whatever he wants. But is it correct to blame money for all these faults? In my point of view people are guilty for what they have done and also what forces them to commit those crimes is not only the money but also the feeling of being best, the passion and the ambition in them.
For the past years it is thought that honesty is the best policy. Although you are poor, if you are honest the others respect you. But I think this idea changed a lot through the years because nowadays unlike the past most of the people respect you only if you are rich. Your being honest or not do not interest them. And they also do not care whether you are a murderer, a Mafia or a smuggler. And when we look at the rich people most of them gained their money from illegal ways as we know that it is very difficult to earn too much money by working.
However people forget something, they can not take this money to their graves, so there is no need to do evil things for more money and besides there is no need to lose our humanity. Conscience is more important that the money and one they it can call to account for the evil things which you have done.
Finally I want to add that what is important is living without adoring money or being a slave of it but living like a human being with the adequate amount of it.

Money was invented by people who lived in Lydia to abrogate "" exchange system"" and to solve problems which that system brings. Firstly, the money which was found to destroy some problems about this system became the cause of bigger problems and enmities among people. Money is a thing for which people die and gain his health thanks to it.
At first, I want to say that we can't think a life without money since with money people can survive. Your being rich affects your health and life. For instance, imagine that, you are ill and have to go to hospital. Since you have got money you can go which hospital you want. So, you can get better thanks to money if your illness has a cure. But I can't say same thing for illnesses that haven't got a medical treatment. If we look from this point of view, money is useful for human being.
Besides this advantage, money also brings many harms to human being. I can give many examples about its damages as money's harms are more than its benefits. Firstly, I want to talk about its affect on human affairs. For instance; I can say that money changes humans characters or their undeveloped characters. When I was studying at high school our neighbor's number came up in the lottery and for that reason we and our other neighbors grinned from ear with delight because our neighbor was rich. But after a few days from this event we were disappointed for our neighbor went away without saying anything from our street where they had lived over twenty years. Then they didn't come again to our city and we didn't hear about them anymore but this event gave us a lesson that money changes people and finishes even your friendship which was since your child.
Money is so important that for the sake of it humans kill each other. Mafia and narcotics such as heroin and cocaine are examples of this exaggerated money ambition. In the world and in our country we watch the news from tv or read it on news papers mafia and their murders e.g. night clubs king mer Topal. If we look main reason of his being killed, money is the cause of this murder. Also, many money ambitious, bad intentioned humans kill our young people by way of narcotics to get much more money.
Moreover, your being cultured or ignorant is depend on money. The thing I want to say that you can't study at university without money. Firstly, to be able to win university exam, you must go to special courses and even you can win university exam you must pay fee for studying at a university. And also, when we compare state schools and special schools we see easily the differences between these schools. It's an undeniable fact that, conditions of special schools such as physical appearance of school, lesson materials are better than a state school's conditions. So, if you have got money you can study at special school's and university, if you haven't got money you can't study in these better conditions or you can't go to universities and you survive as an ignorant man.
Money is so effective in our life that for money a lot of songs are written so far such as an old ""Turkish song "" money, money, money of which existence is a problem, absence of it is a hurt"" and English song ""It's all about money"".
Lastly, if I summarize my writing, your living healthful and your end of life, your education, that's, your way of life depends on money as time is money age.

The more money you have, the more you are loved. Your character has no importance. But although it is something awful, people who have a lot of money try to benefit from this situation. they make a lot of friends not by their characters but by their money.
When you have money, you live in a good house and you have an expensive car, it means you are a valuable person. Wherever you go people behave you well. But that kind of people have physiological problems after a while. Because they are love, friendship and respect what we need in our lives, not much money. This time those people can not decide what to do and start to do bad things. They use drugs, drink alcohol. They give harm to themselves. Some of them even commit suicide.
Money also gives harm to people's relationships. For example in universities there are people who come from different places and cultures. Some of the students are very rich, some of them even have their own cars. Those students usually do not become friends with the students who come from poor families. I do not think it is the fault of neither the rich ones nor the poor ones. Because there is not anything to share, for them. The rich people can not understand what difficulties the poor ones have to face. That's why it is very difficult for them to become friends.
When you enter a place, no matter what kind of place it is, people look at your appearance first of all. If you are wearing expensive clothes, carrying a mobile phone and the key of your car in your hands, people care about you. But if you are wearing old clothes, or you do not look like a rich person, nobody cares about you. Especially in the offices of the government, people do what you want by looking at your appearance. If you look like an important person your work is done first, but if you look like an ordinary person, you may wait for hours.
I do not know if it is the same for every country but in our surrounding it is always the same. If you have money you are very important, if you do not have much money, it means you are nothing.
If everybody had the same living conditions, there would not be people full of physiological problems or people suffering from poverty. That's why I think that money is the worst invention of the human beings.

On recent days money has been too important for people ; more important than most of things that you can never guess , as a result materialism had a big superior on because of money.
People are so addicted to money in recent days that they can do anything for it, they can give up from their relatives , from their friends , they can tell lie , they can steal ... etc. so, great passion towards money can have a bad effect on people but life conditions put money into this situation and made people's eyes blind when they won a lot from it. This event occurs because inadequateness of it in most of people . As people always feels the lack of it when they have a lot of money they get confused in what to do with it what to buy..... the people who won money from lottery can be a good. Example for it. When they have a lot of money , they buy everything they wanted they may turn to bad habits which require money ; drinking a lot , smoking , using drugs etc ..... This occurs because of the fact that they want some difference in their life . These kinds of people don't know the value of things because they achieve them easily but if they achieve in difficulty, it becomes worthier .
Money can fill the person with evil things both rich people and the people who had it after they lived in poverty but these things occur in the people who can't use money logically . In fact money is a very good thing for the people who knows how to use it , a person can profit from every product of the world in best but if he doesn't know the topic sentence can easily be proved .
Most of the people can be deceived and incited with money because in our century it's the weakest point of human - beings , yes , money is the weakest point of human being. Life conditions force human for this , it creates a big compulsory, must for living and it is not earned easily so some people use this advantage very cleverly and make people do what they wanted easily so money becomes a golden key of most of things . We are in such life conditions that people are used for bad things with the money because people can't reject money easily , it requires a strong determination for rejecting . Off course there are still some people who can say "" No "" towards money for their moral values but their number is very few especially in these years . In past, there was not much addiction , wish for money and there wasn't a big inflation as it has been today.
People were also more naive when compared to today. Today, you can't trust people , you can't know them , maybe ambition for money put people this situation . But it is not right to accuse people for this , perhaps , if there hadn't been so much need for it , people wouldn't be in this position . If it goes like that I mean ; the more the people need money the worse they will be .
Even it is good or bad , I think people will never give up from money , they'll always work for it . I don't know whether you realized or not the main aim of people's working , studying is for money , students enter for university exams to have a good job so good job means much more money and they enter university exams over and over to enter the best place that they can go ; to have the best job they can have, to earn the most money they can get .
As it has been now and forever, money will talk in every where for everyone ( exceptions don't change the regularity ). People steal and continue to steal , people deceive and continue to deceive because of money's attraction because of the need of money ; this is a very simple example of the money is the root of all evil .
As a result if you have a lot of money and you know how to use it you are one of the most lucky persons in the world you can have anything you wanted . But if you don't be conscious about it , money can lead you towards bad things , events or attitudes and try not to be the slave of money , try to make less the superiority, masterity of the money in your life as much as you can .

Money had been found many ages ago and since then it has enchanted the people a lot and the importance of it in the life of human being has been increasing day by day. Especially in this last century money has become the only aim of a person's life. People work very hard to earn money and all human beings are trying to have much more money than they have.
In our world today people give great importance to capitalism. Money has a big power on people. One is appropriated according to the money she or he has. If you have money, you are respected. If you have money, you have friends. If you have money you are free to do every thing that you want to do. In other words when you have money you are behaved as a human being. If you don't have money, it means that you are behaved as though you were not a human being. It is the main reason why all human beings go after money. Money means having a big power on other people and all human beings want to have this power. It is strange that money makes a person prestigious. Being respected having a lot of friends around you, doing everything you want to do, conducting the other people as you want to are the thing that all people want to have. These desires come from innate. For that reason having much more money than the other s or having much more money than you have has become the central aim of a person's life. This can be called ""Money Ambition"". If you don't satisfy with the money you have and if you are full of desire to have more or if you are doing something that in fact you don't like to do only in order to have much money it means that you are too ambitious for money. Money ambitious is not a bad thing unless it draws you doing bad things. But unfortunately we come across many examples about what kind of evil things one can do to have much more money. One kills of these kind of people can be the people who are selling heroine, cocaine, etc. to young people. These people sell these substances without carrying of the health of the young who buy them. They do the only for and thing ""money"". They don't satisfy with the money they get and try to enlarge their wealth by selling these things to more and more people who become addicted to these substances must spend their money to buy these things. And unfortunately the number of those people has been increasing day by day and each day a lot of young people who are the users of heroine etc. die (in fact they are killed by the sellers of heroine).
Another example that proves how money ambition can draw some doing evil things is that the people killing their relatives, friends due to a piece of land or property. For example the new that has been recently seen in a newspaper tells us how a son had killed his mother and father in order to be able to benefit from the inheritance. The examples can be expanded easily. The last example that I want to mention is about the people in our country trying to be richer by profiting from people's religious beliefs.
It's true that it is impossible to go on your life without money but the important thing is to satisfy the money you have and not to allow it to draw you doing evil things.

If people are asked what the most important thing in life is, most of them give the same answer: money! The response to the question what their aim in life is, is somewhat different: happiness. Here, one might think, ""where is here the similarity?"" 
The answers are similar, in that for most people happiness depends upon money. In a way this is not very surprising, as generally happiness is received through power, comfort, pride, and popularity.
First of all, to achieve these aims a lot of people are ready to make a hard and merciless journey through life tasting the bitterness of ambition, fraud, jealousy and lies, which in this case seems very sweet to them. It is obvious that all these features have negative associations. But how can a person leave the fingers from money when you can not even make a step without it?  
Secondly, some people just want to make so much money as to stay alive. Therefore they are ready to work hard, and sometimes this readiness turns to unconsciousness. People forget their real aim in life and being unaware of it they glide in to a vicious circle without an escape...
A next issue to be taken to consideration is need. There are a lot of people in the world who do not even find a piece of bread to stop their hunger. What shall these people do if they can not find a job to work in and if the government do not have the power and organization to support them? It is a fact that these people do not think of the moral aspects of their decision. These people find an only way for solution, and this is theft! 
As a result, it can be said that the proverb ""Money is the root of all devil"" in the original meaning of the word is right. However, it depends on the propriety of its use.
If people are after money just because they can not get enough, and if they lose control over themselves then the devil is at work. And in most cases stopping this devil is nearly impossible. The more money is earned or ""not earned"", the more is wanted by people. It is just the ambiguity that awakes the devil, not the money itself. And this ambiguity is created by people, not the money. In the business to make as much money as soon as possible, people forget their real aims in their lives and suddenly they find themselves in a competition against the whole world. The will to be better than the others, to have a more luxury life, to own the most expensive things and thus to be more powerful than the others, leads people who are not able to keep their limits to deeds that are not well- seen in the society. But as long as every individual knows his or her limits and do not lose the control over his or her life, money will just serve for peoples' advantages.

Money! For some is everything and for some is nothing. What can be done with money and what can't be done with money is always a question in mind. Can we say that money doesn't effect our life? Or can we say that every thing is based on money? Another question which is always asked is ;can money alone bring happiness? All of these are always asked and people always wonder the answer.
It is usually said that money is the root of all evil. When thought about this deeply I think everyone will agree. Can we think or a life without money? Of course no. Nothing can be done without money. If you have money you are everything. You can do anything you want and nobody can question you because you have money and you are the king. Every body bows in front of money and people can do many things for money. If you have money you are respected by everyone and have prestige in every encounter. We can see this in everyday life very obviously. When a well-dressed person enters a shop every body tries to help and respect that person. But if a very ordinary looking person enters the shop no body bothers to help unless they are asked. Another thing is if you have money and if you are ill all the doctors work for you. Nothing would be impossible. You can see the best doctors and be cured in the best way. Your children can get the best education opportunity and all doors would be wide open for you. They can go to the best colleges, have extra lessons, attend many social activities and even if they cant enter a good university they can go to private ones. You can buy everything your child wants and let him life the most comfortable life.
When looked from this perspective everything is fine but there is the other side of the story. What about the poor. Don't they have the right to live a well life. But no, if you don't have money you are nothing. You are not respected and always seen as a third class. When a poor person is ill his only opportunity is to go to state hospitals and as we know there they act as if we are animals. Why? Because you don't pay so they don't care whether you are ill or not. Every time the doctors do the same things. Just examine you a few minutes and say ""you have nothing"". Your children don't have the right to get a good education. Because they pay little to teachers in state schools and so the teachers don't care. Why should they work hard for so little? There are many families that can't afford to send their children to universities. They can't make life worth living for their children. Doesn't this annoy the parents. Of course they feel sad not to be able to do what their children want.
As we see the great contrast between the rich and the poor we can easily see the bad effects on money. Poor people when realize the things that can be done with money they would want to live in the same way also. And what are the ways to be rich quickly. Of course stealing or killing for money. People would rob, steal to have a better life. They may kill each other to get money. They may give their soul for money even. So very bad things can be done in order to have more money and these are evil things.

I can not think of a life without money because if you have none ,you have no chance of getting a food or a dress or anything you want which mean a misery for a human. In human' s living process, they are educated, educated for an occupation in the life and to make their livings through this job, this job is also for a good marriage and thus for happiness. Anybody who says that he did not believe in money is probably lying because without money you can not realize whatever you want and people are happy as long as they do the things they like.  myself do not give too much importance to money but  do really know that money is vital for humans. For example,  never prejudice the people by looking their appearance or clothes, I never look for money in friendships and I never buy expensive things. On the other side , I can spend lots of money for anything or anybody that I admire.
But all these do not mean that I am not looking for more, everybody is looking for more in this world, and the main problem is that they do not know where and where to stop .Yes, sometimes looking for more and desires can cause some troubles, because when a person starts to want more and more, I mean the greed of people can lead them to the very big problems. At this point we should learn to live according to what we have in our hands and adjust our lives depending on this . If we can not limit our greed and limitless desires, we can see our end in a very short time.
Poverty can make people to do everything : they can rob, murder, and cheat . But a person who is rich can also do everything to become richer. For example ,politicians in Turkey are cheating the government, public, defrauding the institutions and banks. For what : to satisfy their greed without thinking the poor and homeless people. They are always unfair to the others and busy with filling their pockets. And again devil things happen to innocent , politicians are having fun but the innocent pay the penalty by suffering from poverty.
On the other hand, some governments are producing and marketing the weapons which will end human specie. These hazardous guns are sold only to become domain as a world power and of course to become the richest one in the world. People are always tend to choose illegal, short and easy way of doing anything and also in this situation people choose easy way of earning some money without controlling themselves.
As a human nature, human being is unsatisfied and he is not happy what he has , always wants more and more and never thanks to God what they have. I think these are the main reasons that cause the devil things and unhappiness of people.
As a result people's greed and money passion can bring troubles not only for themselves but also for the others. In order to prevent the evil; an individual must limit own desires, know where and where to stop his greed and must act depending on his money. Secondly , one must know there are other things which are more important than money. Thirdly , we must thank for what we posses , and want more and work hard to get money .Thus, we catch happiness with money because you are deserving this money since you worked hard for it. If people work and happy what they get and control themselves , I think there will be not too much problems occur because of money. And I think we are given money to learn to control our greed and desires.

Perhaps money is the worst invention of the world. From that times to today money captures all human beings in its hand. It is the assistant of ambition and victory. Everybody wants to win a victory and it is always thought that it is probable with money. In fact it has some right parts.
When you look at to your environment, you will see that successfull people are rich, rich are successfull. Because the most valuable reward is money. The only thing that makes people satisfied and happy is money. Money become the tool that makes people happy from the short way without success.
From the time that money become the root of happiness from the short way, it become the root of evilish items. People begin to do everything for money. Lie, theft, smuggling is just for money. they always want more ,no time they satisfied with the things in their hands.
Of course a life without money can not be thought. But the thing that must be is sufficient money and right people. If everyone on earth had been rich, it would not have been joyfull to live. There would have been sadness, arrow and pain.
When I was a small child, I had been asked which job to chose in future. I never gave an exact answer. all my frieds says that they would be doctors. I thought that if everybody became doctors ,who would be the dustman. Than, I decided to be a garbageman. I did not want it be poor, the only thing I want is to live happy with enough money. When I growe older ,happiness come to my mind. When I think of them now, everything was for money .Money bought even my expectations. There is no need to fight with the changes. Because all humanith lives the same feelings with me. It is an event that life requires it. Sometimes just living it makes me happy. There are spreaded families, peple who sell their bodies, commiting sucide. When I see all these people, I am happy to have just a confused mind because of job.
It's mane is to struggle with life. we created a world that can be corrected with money and wealth. We did it. We made the money so important. We gave the perfect qualities to money. And now we accuse it. I think we do not have the right to do it.
We never said ''enough''. We always want , when we want we find, when we want to find we became so contempt. We desire all this evil.
We see in this world a father who thinks of how to get bread to his house and his wife who tries to hide her billions from her husband sharing the same house. Ambition killed the sahring. The two sharing the same house were now enemies to each other. The only problem was money.
We always think people alone. When we think of them as a society , the only big problem of the nation is economy. Humanity makes a nation , nation , not the money. Nations land money to each other but if something goes wrong, they try to put an end to the other nation's history. The aim is always money and land .
If we think of all the subjects that we have just discussed , we came to a solution, which is imposible to think a life without money. The only think that should be done is to learn to leave with sufficient money. We have to prevent the money to be No 1 in our lives. We have to think our humanity, personality and expectations. To make ourselves happy we shouldn't leave ourselves to a piece of green paper. Life shouldn't be so CHEAP.

There is no doubt that, money has had a great importance in people's life. The money was first invented by the Lidians and has gained a great vitality day by day in all fields of life. What we mean is, now money is much more important than anything you can have, even more than life. In this essay I am going to focus on social and economical effects of money on people's life.
Imagine that there are sisters and brothers who lived in their sweet home, they respected each other, fought together in a fight only for being brothers and sisters. After the years they grow up and have their own families. After having their own families they begin to feel the difficulties of life. The economical problems start. In such cases these brothers do not avoid fighting with each other to inherit their father's heritage, they can even kill each other for money. It is not hard to encounter the people who kill human for money, without thinking. This means that they sell their freedom and get a punishment. Being jailed may seem something like very simple, but when think deeply we see that these people can stay in prison only for a small loan. In recent centuries Africans were enslaved by the Americans for their economical purposes. In Africa, native people were captured and taken to America to make them work in agriculture. Americans established bazaars where slaves were sold, being sold in a bazaar 
like an animal must be the worst thing in life in view of honor. In history all the wars were based on economical purposes, I and II World Wars. These wars were broken out only to obtain more petrol, that means money. There are many strong evidences in Turkey for the power of money. In Turkey some parents sell their children for money to European parents who have no child. Sometimes money can be superior to basic instincts of motherhood. Some people sell their organs such as kidney, to rich people for money, this is another common case which can be seen in Turkey. One of most dangerous and hazardous way of earning money is selling drugs to teenagers. That can expressed in that way, they slowly poison the people to the death for money. Money caused people forget their values and customs. Some mothers can commit adultory for money in a room next to their children's to afford their children's life because they are obliged earn the money which is needed. We know that, this is not good however there is no one volunteer to afford their life. People are getting more penny-pinching day by day instead of being generous to each other.
We can give many international cases for the power of money: Although we have our own guidelines in our economy we are obliged to make stand-by agreements with IMF. The IMF wants us to except their suggestions despite the fact that we do not want, but we have to make a concession-The Cyprus Case, Middle East Politician, The Lie of Slaughtering the Armenians etc.
Although all these cases are encountered in Third World Countries we have the same problems (cases), that means our country is a Third World Country. We have to bear all those problems just because we do not have economical power. What can be done to solve these problems are: Making an attack in industry, Having the freedom in financial sources, Making new inventions to make the future bright for us economically.
In fact money seems as if it is the only evil, but I think that all those problems occur due to the lack of money.

The problems have started by the use of money-which is much more practical instead of settling method. As time passed, with the developing of societies and with the increase of needs, that is, when the living conditions have got harder, money's become the root of all evils. At this position, it has gained importance how money is earned and for which purposes it is used. If a person gives harm not only to himself but also to the others and neglect social and ethic rules, it means that he earns money in wrong ways. When we think like this, money has become the reason of several evils. This is because of that money is a magical key which opens many doors. This is also because of the conditions of today. In today's conditions, they aren't nearly given any right to live like human-beings to the poor. However, people living in a society have the same basic rights such as to be educated, to be cared by hospitals and like these, money spoiled this equality and cause inequality. That is, in every stage of social life, the one who pays the piper calls the tune. People give bribe in order to be the owner of many things and to conceal their offense. If there's a need to give an example, a person who commits a traffic crime and gives bribe to conceal his crime will be a good example. This is only a small example. This kind of impropriety has taken place even in the government, which should be the most respectful institution. At the same time, people are murdering each other, they are smuggling narcotic and weapon. This means the complete ignorance of social and ethic rules. In other words, money has taken the place of humanistic values. For the sake of money, people sell their bodies, children and wives. Moreover, in order to survive, they sell their organs, such their kidneys, which has a vital role for their survival. These are organized by groups which are named as Mafia. In other words, this has become a sector.
When people aren't able to achieve the necessary conditions to survive as human beings, that is, when they aren't able to bring bread to their homes, when they can't shelter in appropriate conditions, when they couldn't send their children to the school, when they couldn't respond to his family's needs of health and when they couldn't respond to other needs of their family and most important, when they haven't got a job to achieve all these kind of needs, in societies people can be dragged to suicide. People even commit theft. I want to state that the sanction of social rules isn't important when people find themselves in these conditions.
Because of that money is an important commerce tool, it is an important element of our lives. In other words, in today's hard conditions, people venture everything in order to earn money and survive. They can easily make concession.
As I stated before, it is important how money is earned and for which purposes it is used. So, it will hinder people to suffer if it isn't used in the way of its purpose.

All the children are innocent till they meet the money. Whenever they start to use money or with another word be aware of the importance of money they loose their innocence .But they aren't aware of the importance of money naturally unless some others -the adults - make them aware of t .Then ,we face to a queston :""who makes the adults to consider money as an important or even as an essential thing in the life?""
There is only one answer of this question:"" The system "".
Anybody who is interested in the history of humanity will see that the exploitation of human beings started with the private property .People have been started to be exploitated by the duration of Slavery System .Up to the duration of Slavery System people lived in harmony and they just worked or hunted to survive. However ,whenever the private property took place in their life the harmony was ruined .Nothng has changed from those ancient times but the names and life styles of people who exploitate and of people who are exploitated. The only responsiple of this process is the money. Because money is the symbol of strenght which makes the owner of it untouchable .Let me give you some example :If you remember some teenagers who were less than fourteen were arrested of stealing baklava in G.Antep and fined many years .On the other hand some bureaucrats or bankers were fined just one or two years although they stole billions .If you compare these two cases you will understand better the power of 
money. Yet ,there is a hidden and very important thing in these cases .Why did the boys steal baklava and why did the bureaucrats embezzled the money ?For the fist ones ,they were poor and did not have enough money to buy baklava ;although some people throw money to the dancers in the restaurants or spend a lot of money for their pets which are more important than many people .For the second ones ,they know the hotness of the money and once they start to swindle it does not matter for them to go on any further.
In our society we can see many people who earn money easily .Further more once they start to earn money easily they do not hasitate to earn more money by degrading themselves ; besides ,they even get pleasure to torture them. Well, it is the spring board that they become an evil. That is having much money makes them isolated from the life of pure or from those who have difficulty in surviving .Although they earn more money wihtout working as much as those who make the money for them they even hasitate to increase their salary or in any kind supporting the poor.
To sum, money changes human beings very much and even you can not know them f they do not have a well character. Money makes people loose their personalities and they just become a shit- porter between the kitchen and toilet.

Since the early ages , people had tried various ways to possess their needs. They had planted , had cultivated the soil , they had sewed and had knit in a word they had satisfied all their needs by themselves. By the increasing and changing of needs , they had begun the division of labour and by this way for their other needs which they had not satisfied , people had started to exchange the goods , in other words barter. By the time passes , barter had become in adequate and the way of payment had started. First they did it by valuable things such as gold , but later payment had caused to invent money.
In today's world money is being used to satisfy all the needs. That is , money is necessary to survive. Because of these all the people built their life to earn money. No matter less or more , to live better to have more money.
Who wants to suffer privation ? All the people want to live in better life conditions. That is why want to live better or desire for luxury life have been a reason for ambitions. Money is the most important factor to reinforce the ambition. We all accept that money is necessary to buy , but now we are in such a bad situation that people can buy even people with it any more. And thus , this is occurred social injustice among people. Power of the money caused to be exploited and to be suffered privation by making use of people by each other. People are making faults and committing sins to have power for earning more money. The most of the big crimes are being committed like robbery , burglary , usurpation , malpractice , giving harm to humanity. If we look at the rate of crimes we can easily see that most of them are reasoned bye the desire for much more money indeed. Not only the individuals but also the states are fighting for the money and monetary values. There have been always economical values under all the troubles of the world. The best example had been known for this is Hitler's Germany's persecution to the Jewish. Their main purpose to genocide was economically reasoned. They had so big goals that they were in desire for big amounts of money. At that times the richest people of Europe , so Germany , were Jewish merchants. So they had to take this capital from them. Gobbels who was the German propaganda minister of the National Socialist Party had found the genius idea of the ""pure race"". This idea was very useful for them to be supported by the German society. This support had given them the power to get rid of Jewish people and taking their savings. These savings were used to get much armed and invading the Europe. It was such an ugly event that this dark page had never been forgotten and will never be forgotten.
Of course money is a necessary scarce thing we always in need of. But we do not have to be a slave of it ; we ought to manage money , not let the money manage us.

Money is a means that's applied in the change of goods and service. It was first used in B.C.700 by Lidya State. And for hundred of years it has played an important role to shape our lives.
After World War II it was turned to the system of paper money. In this century and the ones before,   
golden and silver money had prevailed. So, to use in the printing of money, people needed golden and 
silver mines. And this situation lead up to several wars and expeditions that lasted for hundred of years.
so from this events we can understand that money made people greedy.
Actually money is not a bad thing if u use it in the best ways; you could make your wishes, your expectations real, you could have the most expensive cars, big houses, u can go far places, u can travel everywhere
so u could get the value of your own life.
Currently where as money is cosidered by many people as to use for pleasure and amusement, on the
other hand many people try to keep on living with the minimum price, having difficulty in adopting the life  on-going. So money is the key of living. Many couples, just because of the living conditions having   problems and divorcing, and the number of divorcing people are getting much as the world turns, so to
consider the money as a part of living will not be wrong.
One of the drawbacks of money is that making people greedy. People, to verify their strength do the 
works higher than the works on their shoulders, and then they re likely to go down. Everyone underrate u,
you lose your temper, keeping on living in stress, dont care good things. Maybe living will give you much pain
and so the result might not be good, maybe you find solution in the cold embrace of death.
Another effect of money is if you re a wealthy person. maybe you will not consider other people, or
wont think about any bad things will happen to you, because u think u re strong. This situation may lead
you to go to the casinos, so you'll have new habits. Maybe youll be addicted to gambling, and then you'll
deal with the carnal affairs and your life become upside down. You'll be scattered, maybe you ll consider the
facts, on going events, lose money so guickly and everything you have then will fall away one by one.
It will be too late for you to stop this bleeding pain and maybe this will drag u to the horrible situations.
Consequently, with a little money, you live just to keep alive with the same things but if you have 
much more money, you could have the value of your life provided that u use it logically. To say, with  money you re a king, you'll have so many friends! but without money you re just a simple one, you have  limited friends, maybe you'll not have anyone to get help when in need. If you re wealthy, you'll not care 
the poor much since you ll always be with the rich, so maybe you'll lose your conscience. And the people
around you pretend as they like you. Another probablity is to have bad manners that ll affect yourself
and your family in a bad way, so maybe you'll choose the life in a basic way better for you.

Money...According to some ,it is only a paper...According to some it is everything...And according to some ,it is a necessity for life ....Whatever you think ,you would have seen this kind of statement on the celebration cards: wish you health ,happiness and money in your life!
Well, what makes money so important? Perhaps ,the way that goes to the comfortable and happy life passes from money. Perhaps, the reason is that to be able to get the necessary things to survive ,we need money. For example ;it is impossible for people to live without water; but now it is sold...
It is a fact that money has lots of effects in our lives. Perhaps, it simplifies our lives, or it makes our lives difficult and complex. How does money simlify our lives ?When you ask a person what his/her plans for the future or why s/he wants to a job ;the answer firstly will be that. TO EARN MONEY AND BY EARNNG MONEY HAVNG A HGH -STANDART LFE...High -standart-life means a house, a car ,enough money for the rest of life. Wishes and needs start with the birth of a child. Needs and wishes mean money ,meanwhile you can only get it with money. When you have a baby; milk ,clothes for him /her are bought with money. If you have lots of money ,your child can eat whatever /whenever s/he wants, s/he can wear whatever /whenever s/he wants. S/he can go best schools which has much opportunity, and qualified education.. S/he can get benefit all the good things in the world. S/he can stay in the best hospitals and get best care, when s/he is ill. S/he can live in beautiful houses and s/he can go wherever s/he wants to go. Your child may not know the meanings of these words: poor, being hungry, spending time in rows...
How does money make our lives difficult? Since needs start with born, problems start with it if you don't have enough money to survive. One of the most important need for people is physical needs...Eating ,living in a house etc.. Today the reason of lots of crimes is lack of money. Since people can not eat something ,since they can not find a place to stay, they apply to different ways. For example; theft. Most of times people steal a bread just for feeling full. Think of people who is hired to kill someone just for earning money to survive or people who sell drugs ....
If you have less money, it means you have the less chance to get benefit for the good things in the world. Or you have no chance to get benefit from the most qualified things. To be able to do this ,you need to work hard and earn more.
As you see ,it is impossible to live without money. In fact, your point of view changes the meaning of the money. If you think of money as a tool for power ,it means that you are mostly unaware of some feelings like friendship, love...Since these feelings are related with your instinction, you can not buy them. Unless you think of money as the symbol of power ,you can still be accepted as human. As our ancestors said: Wealth is nothing ;because you cannot bring it into your grave ;but friendship, love are permanent feelings...

There are some common beliefs on money. We say ""Money opens every door"" , ""Money makes the world go round"" and ""Money talks"". The general inclination on this matter is that money is the only key to total happiness and that is why people usually think that money is everything to them. They assume that this is the realistic side of life, and they can never think of a happy life without money.
But , in fact , money is not as important as they think in someone's life. Of course you can be happy when you have a lot of money, but there are limits to its power. And this happiness is not prominent. Think that you will go to a party and you do not have enough money to buy a new dress. Think of the role of money here. If you had money , you could afford to buy one of those wonderful dresses and you would be happy. Why not? You liked that dress very much and in the end you would have it. And you would be the most desirable person at the party. But , stop and think about this tiny bit of happiness compared to the big troubles, sorrows, and stresses of your life. The happiness that money brings to you is short lived.
As human beings , there are some other values in our life, which are more important than material things. We have wisdom which helps us to think about everything in detail, we have a heart which helps us feel the joys of life, and we have feelings that separate us from other living creatures and make us human. So we need something different from materialism to be happy. There are invisible, untouchable values which must be in our minds and hearts, such as morality, faith, humanism, self determination are just several of these big values we have.
As human beings, we need love, in fact, all we need is love. In addition we want to be loved by all the people around us. But nobody really loves you because of your millions. If they do they just love your money not you. And when your money is gone, those people disappear, too. On the other hand if you are an unpleasant person ,an egoist, nobody will love you. Moreover they will hate you. You may posses a great fortune, own luxuries houses, expensive cars, even a yacht, but no friends, the result maybe a disastrous situation for you. As long as people do not like you , you are a lonesome man in this wide world. Then how can you live and be happy? Can your money, your richness save you from unhappiness? You can fill your wallet with money, but what about your heart? As you see, a wallet full of money means nothing if you compare it with a heartfull of love.
It is clear that the happiness brought to you by money works only in a limit beyond which morality exists. Since we also need moral values as human beings rather than money ,we must enrich our minds and hearts, not only our wallets. Materialistic richness with us to the grave since shrouds possess no pockets. So let us fill ourselves first with love instead of filling our wallets with money.

On the board it was written that, AM , IS, ARE + GOING TO = CONTINUOUS TENSE. Did you understand what I mean , you fool creatures! These words are belong to a so-called instructor who graduated from FACULTY OF EDUCATION ,after he had taken 4 year education in ELT department. A speech , full of nsulting words; many linguistic terms while teaching in primary school classes.
Many people think that efficiency in teaching is completely, directly, related with duration of your education. Also with the degree you graduate from university. However, those people are wrong, my observations during the SCHOOL EXPERIENCE lesson I took n previous year will be enough for you to join my opinion. A teacher graduated from an Insttute; another one from faculty of education; condition of classes ;ideas of school directors...
Duration cannot be a criterion that will show that' X is a good teacher, Y is not. To illustrate it ,I want to mention about our first day in school experience class: We attended a teacher's class who had graduated after he had taken for 4 year education. He was impatient, he was no creative, he had no aim, he just sat at the chair and criticize students; insulted them and turned us saying :' They are the ones who will make you crazy when you become teachers. After the class , I was fully depressed even the idea of the possibility that one day I will be such a kind of teacher made me really unhappy. I said myself !'Is he the reflection of us after we graduate from university? In other week we attended a teacher 's class who had just graduated from education nsttue; in Hatay, she was more active; she could get on well with her students ,she was nore enthusiastic while teaching . Then I decided that I was at the right place:)
Second reason , why I support the idea that most university degrees do not prepare us for real world has become a clear point in my mind again when I attended the school experience class: We entered the classroom , there were forty students in the classroom. All of them were active; some were running ; some were crying; some were shouting; even some were hitting each other. Teacher spent at least 10 minutes in order to make them feel calm and the rest was 30 minutes, activities should be in a lesson; however , the class was so crowded ; each student had different problems . Either teacher should deal with them one by one or teacher should ignore all of the things happening around her. However you imagine that you will teach in cotton made classes ; it means 15 student classes ; no crowd ;silent students; no problem in their minds; colorful , enjoyable games ; full participation ; full enthusiasim to learn something; no limitation; but the reality is totally different and if you are both personally silent and personally inactive you will be invaded by the reality.
Another thing that I want to mention about is , the views and the perspectives that school directors or majority of teachers have . You can say that those do not sound logical or relevant but when these things begin to limit ; kill your creativity soon , this time the things I mention will become more clear and logical for you and I want to share an anectod with you on this point: One of my friends wanted to wear the dress special for Santa Claus he had thought that this idea would have been both effective in teaching and this would have been a good way of drawing students attention. However, the school director strictly rejected this idea by implying that we do not have Santa Claus in our culture . Ok ,he is completely right but he completely forgot that they are children , they need something funny, colorful, different!!!! We are taught to do everything to draw the attention of our students but we are not said that we will be limited ...
Certain objection ,must, of course be considered that then any degree has no value so what are we going to do then? This is not completely true , at this point we should consider something more important than degrees. Such as PERSONAL IMPROVMENT!!!!!!
In conclusion, I wanted to give you examples that I personally heard or involved. All of them tried to say : Duration of your education or degree in your hand cannot be a key in order to open the doors of real world.(real teaching environment)We have imaginative , creative, active, colorful, free key but the key hole is not so colorful creative as we are taught! So we need something else more than degrees!!!!!!!!!!!!

Throughout the world there are thousands of universities that educate students of different profession fields. Some of them are actually insufficient in preparing the students for real world. It is obvious that these universities demand extending their proficiency in practicality. In all fields, students should be provided with not only theoretically, but also practically. They should be ensured especially with the practical skills and knowledge.
Either universities or any step of education systems aim to reach the top of their students' competence of world knowledge. Contrary to what is aimed, in some fields, generally the lecturers, by means of the system, try hard just for the graduation of the students. For instance, in the faculty of engineering in most universities of Turkey, the students learn something, study hard for the exams by memorization. They do not have enough into practice. They just get the unnecessary theoretical knowledge most probably will not be used after graduation and the theoretical teaching is an easy way of consuming effort and time. For many years, we have been equipped with this knowledge and have been asked to memorize these for any exam we enter. Unfortunately, the theoretical education system has the big hole of the process ""memorization"". What a shame that in the age of technology, we are still struggling against practicality.
According to my point of view, the improvement of a country, at any field, is parallel to it's education level. If the education level is high, the country is also developed. Thus, the knowledge given in universities should be permanent in order to be used not only in education process but also in real life. A well-equipped person is nothing without the practice of how to use her equipment-for example, you are fed up with washing-up, and you buy a dish-washer. You put the dishes into the machine, fix the plug into the socket and press the necessary buttons. It worked for hours. Here is a big surprise for you: the dishes are still dirty! You have forgotten to put the required detergent into the machine; because you are inexperienced. In time, after using the machine many times, you will never ever forget anything about how it works, and, in the end, you have fully cleaned dishes. So as not to make the same mistakes anymore, we need to practice everything for many times before stepping into the real life-if we focus an practice, it would be easier to evaluate. Moreover, it would give more pleasure to the students if they really participate in the lessons.
To sum up, people accept the existence of the insufficient theoretical education system. And, they mostly believe that practicality is needed for this system. Otherwise, students will not be prepared for the real life. It will be difficult to find good jobs after they graduate. They will be disappointed at the beginning of their career. We are aware of the realities of the world. One of them is that we demand to be developed by more importance given to the practical education styles.

Would you like to be a university student? You will start a new
line. What kind of line ;long and thin? Will everything be different in university? I want to learn your answer after talking about some points:
Most of the universities, in Turkey, don't prepare the students for the life. Is it true? let's start with the meaning of the ""university'' in Turkey; what does it mean for our youngs; it means ""job'', it means ""livelihood''. there's a general conception; if you graduate from a university, you can find a good job-although it changes in time-but if you don't you can't. so after finishing high school, students start a marathon; they run and run, do you wonder why? Because they will be a university students, they will have a job. They see universities as an only stair to go to a job, not a stair of the life. I know that having a job is a part of the real life, but there should be some other things in the meaning of the university. University prepare you for the job-if you are in a good department-however don't prepare you for the life. I was one of the students that run in a marathon, now I'm here, my aim was, like others, job. As far as we see in films, news or read on newspapers, in Europe, most of the 
people who take university education are adults who has his/here own family, has children. I mean that the meaning of the university in different from the one in Turkey. Mostly, elder people in Turkey say that:
"" as soon as you graduate from the university, you will see the reality, the real problems of the real life. Here everything is pink''
I think this has a uprightness portion, even some our teachers say this to us. I believe that university life mature us, changes our point of view about the life, but doesn't prepare us for the real life. People think that:
""if you are a university student, you are far away from the problems of the life' maybe this is not totally true, but not totally wrong.
And again what does university mean ;let's talk about it a bit theoretically; it is a Higher Education (schooling) Institution; what! Schooling; acquisition of knowledge. You learn, you are taught; but what are you taught; are you taught the realities of the life? no, you are taught some lessons, some information, some exams. here there is a point; you are taught lessons, but what kind of lessons? Sometimes, we are taught some needless or irreletad information, or even about our own department. They are the important and necessary information, but so necessary that maybe we won't even use in our future in real life. Although some students, especially hardworking ones think that they are related, I don't agree with them.
What happens after 4 years? You graduate from a university with a ""diploma'', a high grade on it. What do you think that high grade shows? Does it show your preparation for the life? NO, it shows your all attitudes, exams or some other things in the university. And the best side of that diploma is that maybe with the help of it, you will find a job.
Some our friends are from other cities and they are student here. They think that here, they are alone, no help of the family .And sometimes even they have to work part-time to earn money, they do their every work by themselves ;and they can say that ""we are learning the real life here, via university''. I can accept this, both taking a university education and doing everything by their own. However, I'm from Adana and a student in Adana again; everything is still ready for me, help of my family etc. So there is a wall between ""me' and ""life''. Maybe because of this I think in this way.
I don't want to say that universities don't prepare us for the life totally, they help in a way, but not enough.

One kind of culture shock faced by international students in the United States is diffculty in communicating with Americans, when they first arrive in the United States, they realize that their verbal skills are poor. First of all, they lack vocabulary, and pronunciation, so American people don't understand them, for example, when you ask an American student how to get to the library, because you have trouble pronuncing r's and l's, the student cannot understand you. You have to write it on a piece of paper. Also, Americans talk too fast, so it's often impossible to understand them, ""later"" means "" I'll see you later"" and ""coming"" means ""Are you coming? "". In short, communication is probably the first problem that international students face in the United States. This shows that in universities the students are not prepared to communicate or use the language in real world. The expectations of university education is changing year by year. Today the most important issue is that 
universities do not prepare students for real world as suggested before.
I believe that the best place for a real education is in the real world with real people doing real things that really matter. Not in a place where the environment is actually controlled by manipulative conditions and marginally monitored by an adult. Not a place where the students is exposed only to pre-planned issues. Not a fake place where the problems are made up or a place where the answer is in the teacher's authority. Real education not between the hours of 8: 00 AM and 2: 00 PM. Over the course of a day, education has no real beginning or ending, but in our society we have conditioned that the academic ""assignment"" is done during academic hours. The real education does not take place from just September to June. Yet educaters suggest that how much one lose over the summer. Wouldn't it be grate if a teachable attitude could be better, but we have conditioned ""the schools are out"", "" we have got the summer"" so the teachable attitude is stopped untill they get back to school. But what about the learning rather than fulfiling the assignments given by the teacher. Learning is never finished or done. It shouldn't be confined the learning is here and at this time; otherwise, learning will be artificial and won't be used in real world.
The tempo of life in the university is very intense both for students and faculty. There is no time to read fiction, poetry, enjoy art or just to relax with friends to share problems. Everything is planned before. As a result, the level of culture and other knowledge, which is not directly connected with study, but can be beneficial in the future. And this situation prevents from creating new knowledge which is the first step for different sciences. Knowledge of mathematics develops memory but art develops creative thinking, and literatur creates problem solving.
We learn foreign languages only in school. As a result, we are lack of cultural awareness, knowledge of other countries, but we students are open to new and unknown. But educational establishment could use from hiring international students at the university. So we will be concious about the culture of the particular country that we learn the language and we will use the language for real situations.
People say that planned education is vital for learning because if it is not planned every teacher will do what he wants and so there will be no particular level of students. But, I think, learning is not for passing exam, it is for life, to live in better situations. Learning is for being sophisticated about the life's bringings. If I learn the language but I couldn't use it, would it be beneficial for my life? The prepared plan says  should learn ""passive"", but I am not good at even pronuncing passive, so should the teacher go on with the plan? 
Universities do not prepare students to real life, they do not prepare students to be a civil in a society which is different from school environment. University does not prepare to real world because it is confined with time, place and issues and because it is forgotten that learning is cannot be confined because it is i everywhere. For the last university does not prepare us to real world because there is too much burden for both the faculty and the students. We have no time to reading, to be involved in social activities or to be involved in literature or art. There are so many solutions to this problem but as I search the most affective way is exchange programs with international scholars and students, especially those in language learning, can be very beneficial for both sides.

I do not have any specific information about the education system of other countries and the basic features of their universities. But it is so clear that anyone from any other country foreigner can see that the education system and most of the universties in Turkey are theorethical and do not prepare the students to the real life. It is easily understandable that the universities in our country have two main problems; Monetary problems and the other one is the education system in our country.
The first reason which do not give any right to prepare the students to the real life is sourced from the state universities in Turkey have very low aid from the government. They do not take enough money to povide real environment to the students. The monetary problem is limited the practical sides of the science. For instance; The classrooms are not decorated appropriate for using real means interested with the lesson. So, most of the time the lesson has to be passed over lightly. Absolutely, this problem is not sourced from the teachers or the students, the real responsibility is in the government's hands. Surely, the government wants to do some regulations to broaden the rights of both the teacher and the student. But they do not mention the payment that they should give the universities. Most of the time the students passed over their training period without doing extra studies interested in their field or do something for themselves for pleasure except passing the exams. It is really a big problem that the tutors only full the student's mind with mostly unnecessary things which only works with the student job, they do not add maybe can not add anything except this.
Our second problem the education system in Turkey apart from the monetary problem of the state universities, is a big problem which must be handled immediately. The system in education is very strict, it uses the student only as a model. It does not wait or want any aim from them. If you are in class and can answer the questions which directed to you at least half of the questions, you are expected to be a hardworking student. Your social life, your expectations are not mentioned and have no importance most of the time. It is really a teacher and lesson oriented system.
Although the government in Turkey has some sayings about education as ""the education is our necessity like food and water"" it is a real observation that it has been never ever given the real importance to the education even from the first grade to the last grade. With this perspective we can still see our second problem about the universities are theorethical because of the education system in Turkey is right. If the government do not do any payment and if the students are not rich enough to pay high taxes (in reality, in Turkey it is taken in low rate while many European countries do the opposite, they give allowance to the students) the tutors, teachers have to obey the rules and use the means that they have in their hand to enlighten their students.
In conclusion, in Turkey most of the universities are not prepare the students for real world it is so clear that all of them are theorethical. The young generation in Turkey want much more reality in their lesson and real environment. Only if the government can help the universities and provide healthier systems and regulations for education, be the universities on the right way. Parallel with this right way the enrichment of the people and the country will be in a better line much more quickly.

Today, universities whose numbers are more than thousands all over 
the world are significant education institutions that educate people
according to profession fields. So which factors make these education
institutions so important? Maybe the first factor is that it educates human, 
the other one may e its professional education, and third one is most
probably its academic characteristics.
The quality of education of a country goes together with the 
development level of that country. If universities' goal is to prepare the
people according to their professions, their first target should be to make
these people professionally competence. Therefore; the education system
is very important. "" How to supply education to the students? "", "" Should 
the students be directed to the memorization? "", "" Should the students deal 
with unnecessary items? Or ""Should they take knowledge related with the 
real life and abstain from extras? "" 
It is wrong to put all universities in the same boat. I am talking
about the most of them. Today in many universities the education is 
presented to the students theoretically. The students are rather passive
many times. They come to the class, just listen the lesson and then go.
At the end of the lesson most of the knowledge they acquired is staid on the
notebooks. However, if they were presented the lesson practically not
theoretically, the knowledge will be more permanent in their minds. They will
be willing to have that lesson again, get more pleasure of it.
In my opinion the knowledge which is learnt theoretically, is exposed 
to be forgotten and its permanence is very little value. However, I think if we 
present education in a practical way and enable their participations to the
lessons, it will be more permanent.
This example will enlighten you. Suppose that you are asked for your 
comments about a country or a city which you have not been and not seen.
But you are limited what you have already read about it. Besides suppose 
that you have been or seen that country or city and had experience of it.
In which way would your comments be effective? Can you see the 
difference? 
We can see this difference in our country' s universities more clearly.
Many lessons in most departments are unrelated with preparing the
students to the real life. The students are surrounded many unnecessary 
knowledge. So how much of these knowledge will be acquired in their 
profession life? When will the individual apply to these unnecessary
knowledge? This is nothing more than consuming time and labor.
I have mentioned about the balance between the quality of education 
and development of a country at the beginning of my essay. Let' s talk about 
it some more. There is no need to discuss the importance of the education in
determining the fate of the country. If you look at the improvement projects 
of the countries, you can see the innovations that will be done in the field 
of education at the top of lists. The universities whose aim is to educate 
qualified people should set up their own education policies regarding to 
these criteria. Unfortunately, this lack of the universities effects not only 
the fate of countries, but also the history of human. Have you thought 
about this problem before? 
We are in the technological era. We are making our lives easier and 
more practical by means of the innovations of the technology. So why do not
we enable this practicality in the education system? The universities' aim 
should be educating people for the sake of the development of whole world.

Nowadays, there have been many debates on whether most university degrees are theoretical and don't prepare students for real world or not. There are many factors that make universities fail to prepare students for real world. For one thing, aim of the universities is to deal with science and to educate students as searching, asking and comparing individuals according to this aim. In order to accomplish this aim, universities give heavy tasks and responsibilities to students to be handled. They manage to handle these tasks and responsibilities just to be able to pass the exams, but after the university it is debatable whether they are graduated as searching and asking individuals, but it is for sure that not even half of the university graduates search for anything about their own branch or anything else.
Some opponents of this argument say that universities prepare students for real world and the reason for students not to be real searching individuals is that they must work in order to gain money and lead their lives so there is no time for them to deal with anything else. Maybe they are right in this point but the universities fail to educate them as searching individuals because of universities' education quality. The system makes students to memorize everything because of this students' knowledge goes to short-term memory and after some time they forget what they learn.
Another reason for universities to be theoretical and not preparing students for real world is that there are huge differences among universities. For example, a student who is a graduate of Hacettepe University is not the same as the one who is a graduate of Harran University. If they apply the same job of course Hacettepe University graduate will get the job. It is because Hacettepe University has better education than Harran University. So, at this point we should ask some questions: why are there such a huge difference between Hacettepe and Harran Universities? Why aren't they equal in their education quality? What is the offense of Harran University graduate? The answer could be the opportunities or the education quality they have but there shouldn't be such differences among universities because it means also there are differences among the students.
In addition to all of these factors, the biggest problem is that students cannot apply what they learn in the university outside. For example, Faculty of Education students take metodology and material development courses, but these courses can be applied in ideal classes which consist of 20 students so that the teacher could be able to involve each student actively in the activities he or she prepares. However, when we have a look at the schools in our country we see that it is difficult and sometimes impossible to involve all the class actively in the activities because there are 35-40 students in each class and maybe more in some schools. Of course there are schools which have many opportunities for each student with their ideal classes, but they are private schools and the ones who cannot pay for it cannot benefit their opportunities. for this reason, although universities have many opportunities in order to supply their students with a boundary of knowledge, once they go outside and 
begin to work they see that there are not such opportunities because of some economical and political problems the country have.
To sum up, although universities are democratic, full of opportunities and broadening the point of view of their students, it is the whole system itself with its economical, political and historical deficiencies which is responsible for universities to be inefficient in preparing students for the real world. First of all we should provide suitable working conditions and opportunities for students to be able to apply outside what they learn in the university and of course universities should be equal in their education quality. Only then could we say that universities are indeed preparing students for the real world.

Is the knowledge taken at the university enough to find a good job? 
University is an education place where akademic knowledge is given. A great many people attend university to take education to find a good job; However, they don't know whether the knowlege taken at the university is enouh to make them ready for the real world.
One of the biggest mistake that students and their parents do is: They think that universities supply a great opportunity to find a good job. In fact that is not in the way they thinkas it is individuals who create opportunities. An important reason why there are many unemployed people graduated from university is that they don't have enough feature to find a good job. Although they give five years education , many universities can't supply the feature employees looking for. As a result students attend language or computer courses individually after or during education. Only the people who develop himself or herself have a chance to find a job and people who don't have any feature except university gives do not have a much chance in the real world.
An mportant reason for the weakness of university education is that there are many universities and all of them have almost every field. This situation seems to be advantageous. Infact t is not like t seems becouse of two important reason. one of them is that many universities do not have enough academics to attend lessons. the other one is that there will be much more graduates than the country need. As a result , this situation causes to be many jobless graduates not well educated.
Many universities force students to learn much more knowledge than they need. They don't use these introductions even one time; Eventhough, they become knowledge centers. For example; A student from deutsch department have a great knowledge on grammer. He may know all the grammer rules; However, he can't speak , on meeting with a native speaker. As a result, the student, who is dissapointed , thinks that his all knowledge is useless and he prefers to introductions he can use everytime.
Another important point is lack of experiences. Universities supply only one or two months experiences to their students in many fields; However many emplooyes looking for at least five years experiences to employe. As a consequence, many graduate who is full of knowledge is dissapointed when they couldn't take a job. Many university students would rather to have more experience when they graduate.
Important to say , universities should be a bridge between students and companies. Many students don't know what to do and where to go after graduating from university. If the students in university were in contact with campanies during their education, they would be more ready to the real world. First of all , they will have all feature they need, becouse they will see their deficiencies during their meeting with the campanies, and they will settle them. Secondly, they may make their decisions before graduating. If universities supply these opportunities to their students , many of the graduates will have more chance.
On seeing strange examples, students sometimes think that t is not necessary to gradute from university to be a succesful businessman. For example, a turksh clock salesman, n Australia, has many vendors eventhough he started with one clock. many well_known marks ask him to give strategies for selling; moreover, he gives courses in some universities in Avustralia eventhough he is not educated.
To sum up, there are many universities in Turkey and these universities have almost every field. However; the important thing is not building university , but the functions of universities. If there were not much more universities than people need, the quality of education would be more qualifed and there would be no jobless graduates.

University. student. real world! There must be a relationship between these three concepts; but is there really a connection between them today? Does university really prepare the students for the real world to be able to be successful in every efforts of the real world by overcoming the various problems? These are the questions that all authorities. students and other relevant people in university should ask themselves.
If you ask me. as a universiy student. I do not think that there is a certain. complete relationship between those concepts; university. student. real world; because now I am afraid of being a teacher. Why? In fact. should I not be afraid? This situation points out that there is something incomplete somewhere. And I am aware of that incomplete thing; it is the lessons which are given just theoratically. Teachers say how to present a lesson. make exercises. draw attention of students and sometimes we make presentations in our classes. As you see. I have said in our classes. This phrase points out one of the important lackings. It is our classes. our friends. For instance. while I am presenting a grammar rule such as simple past tense. they already know that tense because they are not the students in a secondary school. So while I am asking questions or making exercises. they all give correct answers every time hence I do not experience any difficulty. But 
when I become teacher. I will teach lessons to real students in secondary school. of course they will not understand the lessons many times and give wrong answers to questions. then what will I do? How will I overcome even such a very simple problem? The other problem is that we do not have the chance of making many presentations to be accustomed to becoming a teacher in a class. In a term we can make only a few presentations and I suppose that this is not enough. So still we become nervous while we are in front of the class. In brief. nothing is real and nothing is enough. Everything is theoratical.
Also. in university it is always said that when you become a teacher. you should do this. this. This (eg/using materials. listening to students problems. aiming to make all students understand all lessons. . etc) University makes us aim many things. but everything is presented in an optimistic way. And we know that nothing is perfect in Turkey. Classes are very crowded. time to teach a lesson is not enough. level of the students are different despite their being in the same class. there are lack of materials in the schools. Of course in some schools all these are perfect but those schools are private ones and we know that nearly all of us will be teachers in government schools so it is inevitable to come across many various difficulties besides the ones I have said above . Therefore . because of all these reasons we will not be able to make our aims real when we become teachers. In university we look at the world in an optimistic way; however in real world it is not so. Moreover. I can see many examples around myself. I know a few teachers. I asked the question whether the university prepares the students for the real world or not. And they told me that every teacher faces to difficulties without fail within the first a few years. They become stressful. They do not know what they will do. And I know that we will also have difficulties. but why do we have to experience those bad years? Then we can understand that what we expect and what we face to are different from each other.
In conclusion. I do not tell that we do not get any knowledge or we do not improve ourselves in university. I do not mean that the information given in university years is unnecessary or unimportant. Of course we learn much. all lessons given in university are useful for both ourselves and our business life. But I have wanted to say that there are some lackings in education in terms of its not preparing the students completely for the real problems. that is. the real world which is full of many problems which can not be seen in an optimistic way. .

The education in university is important for many people all around the world and so many people are giving effort to take a place in university classroom. In addition to this three questions come in to our mind. Firstly, why do people want to go university? And then is the education given in universities enough? Does the universities really prepare students for the real world? I will try to answer these questions in this article.
The answer to first question is having a better job. The university degree provide people a statue and a chance to have a job wherever they want. When you apply for a good job, in a company the first question is wheather you have university degree or not. I think the reason of this is having many unemployment people and this is a good way to choose which person is more qualified. Thats why you need a university degree. In contrast to this, having only degree is not a criteria . also, you should develop yourself too. When it comes to the second question which asks whether the universities education is enough or not. Answer is both yes and no depending on department and quality of the university. Students learn everything about their department in class environment. Mostly they dont use what they have learned practically. In exams mostly theoritical questions are asked and students recite and answer.
Education is enough in regard to theoritical knowledge, on the other hand when it comes to practising they fail. Of course it isnt like that in each department of the university. For instance in Medical Department students take both theoric and practical knowledge. Especially during last two years they start to behave as a doctor. But in Engineering Department students make every projects on a paper. I didnt see an engineer candidate make a real robot or machine . If we think about teaching department practicum education is not enough. Whatever students learn important or unimportant, they have less chance to use them. They also attend practicum school but i think it is not enough. In lessons most of them can tell the course but it is different to teach young learners then advanced ones. I dont know whether there is a solution to this or not. Of course experts know better then me. As you see from the examples education in university are different in each department.
Third question looks for whether the universities prepaire students for real life. My answer is yes. Students cannot have practical knowledge. But university is a good chance for a person to grow himself and to learn how to stand on their own foot. University life have both happy times and tough times. Students may feel themself alone, bores , sort of money, crazy, strong, weaketc. I have encountered all these situations in my university life. Moreover, students are trying to have a relationship with the people who have different characters. So that they learn hhow to tolerate people, not to trust everyone except themselves. However the most important thing is whatever you face, you learn how to stand on and how to survive.
To sum up, university is a part of our life. We have taken theorical knowledges and we have gone to school just the purpose of going but what we have gained is we have learned many things in university life without realizing. I dont agree that universities doesnt have value. In contrast, university has so much value in all over the world. Otherwise why do people spend so much effort to be able to a university student?

University is an educational institution at the highest level, where people study for a degree. University is the highest in quality among educational institutions. It prepares students for a good future. It provide people to be cultured, educated, foresighted etc. . . People learn to stand on their feet with the education and life experience given in the universities. Mostly teachers want students to research their subjects, lessons in order not to allow them to become addicted to ready information. Because it is not wanted to educate students who learn by rote. But, more than necessary information are given to students. It is so much that students are transformed into a databank. Because, most of them are learned by heart, they are forgotten and not used properly. So, it is suspicious that degree which is given in universities prepare people for life. There are some reasons for its invalidity.
First of all, lots of information are given to students. Whether data are necessary or not, students learn them mostly without comprehending. So, they do not use most of them in the future. For example, a student who is in English teaching department has enough academic knowledge, but he/she can not speak English fluently. Although all of the skills (reading, writing, listening/speaking, grammar) must be thought, generally students do not learn speaking and grammar skills. Most of the third or fourth class students (senior) in university can not talk with a foreign person fluently. Most important, grammar information are not given thoroughly after first year of university. Actually, it is the most necessary lesson which must be thought. A student who will be a teacher must take these skills every year. This is one of the most important problems that students complain about in Turkey. Because a student who does not study grammar on her own by solving questions in test books, can forget the details of grammar. Only education taken from university can not beneficial for them. So they must educate themselves.
Secondly, internship period is very short. I think it must be longer. It passes one month long. So, it can not make students to be an experienced person. They have so insufficient work experience that they cannot find any work that they are accepted. Because companies want experienced staffs. They can only find a job in government offices. Most universities graduate ordinary people. I think students must work while they are going on their education. So, they are not in paradox or hesitation when they begin their working life. Learning by living is the most permanent learning method.
Also, I think that exams do not reflect students real performances. Teachers sometimes prepare exam questions in wrong way. Questions can be very easy or very hard. So there is not any validity of these questions. Or, students can cheat. It reflect to our profession certificate.
Briefly, in general universities provide many opportunities to a student. But still, it is not sufficient for finding a good job. I think our education system causes all of this problems. It has many mistakes in it. I believe that all of the problems will be ended, if educational system is changed. Here the most important duty is belong to students. If they want to good future, they must work very hard.

All human beings always find reasons for all the happenings. May be it is the easiest way to feel ourself better in negative situations. We blame money for all evils since it can give people a comfortable life. Most of the people want to get it in an easy way and they commit all kinds of crimes for the evil money. Money enables gaps between people, it leads people to commit crimes; it causes deaths, it is the reason for people's losing their human values.
Money enables gaps between people. Yes, there are really gaps between rich and poor people. Rich people are respected by all the people around them. People address them restpectfully. It does not matter whether they are good or bad. The only important point is their being rich. People do not respect to poor people. Even poor are insulted by people around them. I saw people behaving tovards people according to their wearing. This is really a stuation to pity on. We are human beings but we neglect human values because of this evil money. I belive that rich people are lack of important values. They only order. They do not think the problems of people around them. This is not valid for all rich people but for the general. This situation is the same for all the rich nations too. They do whatever they want. They win the wars. They have more opportunities in agreements after the wars.
Money leads people to commit crimes. Everyday we are reading from the newspapers or watching on television the crimes committed for money. There is nothing that human will not do for money. Some people are robbing banks without hesitating. They do not care whether they injure people working there. Some are robbing people walking on the road. There are people who are breaking into houses to steal something. They are again giving harm both the people living in those houses and the goods in that house. They are doing all tese for money. People are sometimes committing crimes for very small things such as something to eat or something to wear but these are again because of being lack of money. Everyday such crimes are getting more and more commen. Because there is an economy problem at everytime in everywhere , so people are committing crimes. There was a broadcast on TV which was wery tauchy and a stuation to think about deeply. There was a family: parents and three children. The 
youngest child was very ill. He need an operation to survive and the operation was costing too much money to this family. Father was not earning enough money to pay for this. He tried to rob a bank but he could not achieve his goal. Police caught him. After this new, a few rich people helped them and the child had the operation. Some people are committing for they really need, but some are doing this for they have endless demand for money. Drug sellers are the best example of this situation. People are making smuggling or they are selling drugs to earn money. They do not think whether the drugs they sell giving harm to the young bodies or not. They only think the money they will earn in this illegal ways. As we see from the examples the demands are also killing the human values.
Money causes lots of deaths. We are again hearing and watching the people committing suicides because of the money. People especially businessmen who go bankrupt again finding the suicide as the only solution. People who have big economical problems are trying to solve their problems in the same way. In such situations people are living a great depression. They hate living. And they hate all the people around them too. They do not want to live anymore.
Money is also the reason for people's losing their human values. Especially rich people are lack of all the nice emotions. They only order they think they can solve all the problems with their endless money. This is general idea for rich people but it is not for all the rich people. People are also behaving each other according to their richness. Rich people are more important than poor people. Rich people are more respected ones. They are luckier everytime then others. I have heard that people are deceiving eachother by seeming as a lovely friend to steal eachother's organs in order to earn money. Yes, people are so bad when the subject is money.
Consequently everybody has a demand for money. This is normal because we need it to live, but the important thing is not to lose our human values for this evil money!

With the invention of new things and the development of technology, some values like honesty, respect, kindness and friendship begin to lose their importance day by day. People give importance money than the other things . They are filled with desire and ambitious , and they become like doing everything to gain the money.
Money is the root of all evils. We will examine this under different categories. There are some people who have to do harm, for they are in a bad condition . They are indeed not bad people but as life is very difficult , it drags them into a bad situation . They do crime in order to survive. On the other hand , there are some who want more and more although they have . They are full of badness. In spite of everyting , they do not become satisfied. They can think of nothing else except money, they like it very much. It becomes their friend, in another word, it is everything for them. Money is like a breathe for them. They are excessively fond of money. There is a proverb about this situation; there is something about money that
is very alluring.
Variety of crimes like murders, robbery, theft, bribery, gambling, smuggling and prostitution are the result of money. People do these crimes to gain the money and become rich in a short time. We see and hear a lot of things on TV every time that many people kill even their relatives and friends to take their money.
I think that money causes not only crimes but also the destruction of the relationship between people. It can cause friends to lose their friendship . Nowadays, since money takes place everything , they do not care about values like friendship. If you have money , you have many many friends, you are the boss and you are the most important and valuable person in the world. For your money , they serve you with utter faithfulness and obedience; on the other hand, they can sell you even your friends.
Unemployment is the most important reason that people may do a crime. Because it drags them into a depression. As a result, they commit a suicide to go on living. Last week, while I was watching news on TV, I saw a man who was arrested because of robbery . His excuse was known; he lost his job owing to economic crises, so he had to do this. He took the responsibility for his wife and three children.
We can give Argentina as an example , too. As we know, Argentina had an economic crises last year. The most important result of economic crises in Argentina was the social deststruction. There were many crimes like plundering . People attacked to the shops and plundered the things. Furthermore , for years , money have caused the countries to lose their relationship. That one country thinks of what will benefit itself and wants to enlarge their land, causes wars, 
I will give an another example about theft. I read a news on newspaper that two men who wanted to take the bag of a pregnant woman attacked her. Also , the sister of the woman who tried to help her was attacked. The woman was taken to the hospital, because she was seriously injured. She was about to die and had to stay at the hospital for days. As her life was in danger , doctors did not let her give a birth . Otherwise, she would lose her life. I do not understand these people , how they can attack a person to take her money.
As we see , all of the bad things are the result of money. It has become our most important need like water and food. People speak most of the time about it, because everything depends on money. The one who pays the piper calls the tune. However, we do not know how to use. As we give importance money than the other things , everything becomes unbalanced. If we can balance everything and use the money properly , there will be no badness in the world.

Money is something that people use to buy food, clothes, to travel or anything they need. As everybody knows if there were nothing called money, there would be no order in the world. If there were no money, there would be no teacher, doctor, grocer, lawyer or any other job. So there would be no school, hospital, market, etc. Everybody in the world has a job to earn money and to be able to live. So there is an order in the world.
In the old times, people used to change things when they need anything. Then they began to use gold when they want to buy anything. Nobody gave anything to anybody without taking something. As years passed people invented money, so they began to use money when they want to buy what they need. Money is used in all around the world. Every country has got different types of money. For example Turkey uses Turkish Lira, America uses Dollar, German uses Euro. The use of money can not be refused. But sometimes money can be harmful in our life.
Espacially nowadays we see some people take all risks to have some money. They even give harm to other people. As earning money is difficult and working areas are being limited day by day, people can not earn money. Being poor makes some people loose their mind and they do terrible things as stealing, breaking into the houses, robbing banks or even killing people. We see these kinds of events on television everyday. Day by day earning money and finding a job become more difficult. The number of unemployed people increases everyday. So unemployed people do these terrible events to have a little money. In this point we see that money is a kind of harmful thing for people.
Everyday we see small children in the streets selling handkerchief, gum, doing shoe-shining or any other thing for earning some money. Some are begging money from people. They do these things because their parents are poor and they want their children to work or beg in the streets. Their aim is to have a little money to be able to buy food, clothes. These children cant go to school, they can not be educated, they can not buy what they want. As they have got no maney they can not live in good conditions. While the children of a rich family can buy whatever they want, live in a comfortable house, go to the best schools and be educated well for his, her future, other poor parents children have to work in the streets and cant guarantee their future. Sometimes we see on television that a man tries to commit a suicide, because he has no job, so he cant earn money. He cant provide a good condition for his family. He cant buy even bread, he doesnt have a house to live in it, he can not buy any cloth to his children and he doesnt have any money to provide a good future for his children. So he finds the way in committing a suicide. So we see the harm of money for poor people.
Money can be harmful for rich people, too. Even a man has so much money, he cant be satisfied with it. He wants more and more. So some rich people gamble for enjoy and more money. But they cant be always lucky and sometyimes they loose all their money in gambling. Every night they go out with their friends and gamble. They dont think about their family. They dont take care about them. Because of gambling, some people divorce. Gambling gives harm to many families. Rich people are not satisfied with the things in their hands. For example, a man has a wonderful car that everybody admires, but still he thinks to buy a better one. They dont think about the people who dont have even a house to live in it.
Money is a kind of divorce reason for many families. For example, a couple get married happily, they are in love with each other. Their marriage goes well for one or two years. But a few years later, if ones working life goes bad, the problems begin. As they can not buy their needs, the economical problems get bigger and bigger and the couple become unhappy. They understand that they cant live together and they decide to divorce. So economical problems can cause couples divorce.
Although money is the main thing of our life, it can sometimes be harmful. The only way is to increase the working areas and to educate people well. So there will be no unemployed people and eveybody will earn money. Especially nowadays being poor is a really big problem, because life is not easy.

TRCU1118,3.5,,,,,,"In the words of the old song: ""Money is the root of all evil""","
There is a system going around the world and if we are living and if we are human beings we should conform to the rules around us. But these rules are determined by some kind of power. The power I mention is the power of the money. Yes , it is sometimes very important and above all the things. There are many implications which can easily prove how much power it has. Besides its positive effects , it causes many negative results such as ; murder, hijacking , lack of education , problems in your personality, giving harm to people around , breakdowns in relationships , deficiencies in improving your skills , and so on . . .
As in all the countries in our country people are classified into groups. Although this classification is not made directly, people can feel this because of the inequalities in their living standards. People who have much money are at high statue. People who have money which can only help themselves to live on are at middle statue . People who have not money or people who have money which is not enough to live on are at low statue. And these differences in statues and standards lead to many problems.
First of all , I want to mention about the educational problems which are caused by the shortage or absence of money. People who are at low and middle statues can not give enough education to their children. When you look at the studies which were made in educational areas , the results of them show that there is a positive relationship between the level of income of the parents and the level of education and the success of their children. Students who have a chance to improve their study skills and their level of education have a chance to find a qualified job in the future , too. Thus they guarantee their life in the future. On the other hand , the students whose family budget is very small do some kinds of works after school. This affects their performance in the school and many of them leave school because of the responsibilities which are taken on themselves in their small ages and which are caused by the lack of money. Unfortunately in the future , most of them will be still working under very bad conditions and they will be defined as uneducated people in the classification of people in terms of their level of education. As a result of this they will be extricated from their jobs.
Another consequence of the lack of money is that ; children go to the streets which they see very attractive , colourful thinking that the streets can give the luxurious life they wanted which their parents could not give. When they can not find the life they wanted , they begin to look for a job . Of course nobody gives a job to a child except some conditions. They earn money from illegal ways such as drug trade , murder , hijacking , begging. Some of them begin to smoke or take alcohol. As you know the bad habits are not easily given up. When they can not find the thing they want they give harm to other people and to themselves. For example when they take too much alcohol , they can die or kill themselves unconsciously.
Money has another negative effect. It causes breakdowns in peoples` personalities and in their relationships between other people. When you have money you feel more confident. You behave according to your budget. When you can not do the things you want you feel disappointed. When your friend buys the car that you could not buy because of its cost , you envy your friend and in order not to give harm to him , you go away from him . I know many people who leave their partners because of financial problems.
The excess of money creates a chaos too. People may make extra business or give a start to different working areas just for fun. They may win enemy unconsciously.
Money is necessary and important to provide a warm house to homeless people in cold winter days , to give warm and delicious meals to hungry people , to give salaries to poor people, to help ill people , to give presents to friends , old people , family members . But it should not be used to perform devilish things. It should not be in front of some values such as humanity , philanthrophy, honesty . Unfortunately money puts a stop to these things. Nowadays people see money as the only ideal power to perform the things which are for their own benefits and thus it becomes a root for all the evils.

As a student of ELT department, l agree with the though most university degrees are theoretical ant do not prepare students for the real world. they are, therefor, at little value. I am at the thirth class and one year for prep class, which means four year at the university. thats l have only one year to be teacher . last one year to say hello to real world. However, when l look at the back, l see that, this four years duration has given me no experience for the future. This fact is only one of the reasons l can list to say universities do not prepare students for the real world, so they are at little value.
When l first started to to study at university, with the happiness of being a part of this wonderful world, l could not understand the importance of the difficulties which we will face after graduating. Yet, the passing time has brought many anxiouses. Although we have training period at second and fourt class, that is twice, l dont feel ready for teaching. When we went to school at the second class, we just observed the the students ant the teacher, and of course the ways the teachers follewed while teaching. I admit that, we all had some experiences but not enough. We may go to schools rather frequently. So, we can experience much more things about the real life. We all know that, living the real situation always work better. I dontt want to have any trouble with my students when l say hello to them as their teacher. I want to know them, the conditions they study more. I believe that more experience is more success.
We not only have lack of training experience but also have many useless courses at university. I dont hesitate to use useless word because they are. we are here, at ELT department, to be teacher, to teach language. However, we have many theorical courses we will never need, we will never need to teach to our students. Okay! I cannot ignore the importance of having a strong language knowledge. But we need something more. Instead of having such kinds od courses, we may focus on the effective ways of teaching. I think, having these useless courses is just spending time for nothing. While arranging the curriculum, the needs of schools and students should not be ignored. So then, we can be ready enough for them.
In addition to these disadvantages, we also have a bad managing system. I mean, the regulation of the Education Faculty is full of wrongs. The regulation lets students not to care the courses exactly. The students who study just to pass the exams are getting educated worse and worse day by day. I am one of these students. In fact, it is very easy to graduate from this faculty but being a teacher! ! ! I do not want to study lesson as  really get bored. Again the problem of theorical courses. As l mentioned before, there must be something more creative. Thats students should be allowed to perform their capacity. Covering the subjects, always in the same way, boring courses, topics with no exciety lead the students to be more passive . And also, they dont have any problems about the exams as all of them are related to the things you learn by heart not you get. High scores, good degrees then uneducated students with no qualities. The cirriculum should be redesigned for a better 
system. There must be something so new and creative that students must forget the scores. The only thing they care must be the qualities of being a good, well educated teacher. Graduating with high scores will not help us when we are unable to answer the questions from the students.
We also must be able to perform our teaching ability at university, at courses as much as possible. With the help of courses, never theoritical ones, we can practice the teaching activities. It is not easy to be in front of so many students without any experience. We can start at university then at schools ( the training periods) . So then, we can come over this problem, as well.
To sum up, l say that, as a victim of this system, when l review all these problems again and again, l still insist on the university degrees are theoritical and do not prepare the students for the real world. Next year, when l graduate, and when it is time to say hello to my students, l do not want to regret of being graduated from a university in Turkiye, in my own country. It is not my fault. I am here, ready to do my best but they? Something must be done (we all know and you ! ! ! ) in a short time. Otherwise, there will be more victims.

Most people who are graduated from a university have difficulty in adapting themselves to their job. Moreover, a lot of companies want people who have worked at least a few years at the another company although these people have university degree since most company do not believe these degrees reflect the real ability and success -that is a real value-Indeed, their common idea is most universities diplomas are a must but they determine little value because these universities do not prepare to real world for starting a new work. There are some reasons why it is taught about university degree.
First of all, when a lot of new graduated people start a new job without work experience, they face to a lot of difficulties in real life because they have theoretical knowledge about their job, yet, they do not know how to use this. Furthermore, they are unsufficient about being active in their job. For example, a person who has been graduated mechanical engineer, has passed a lot of exams about the theoretical knowledge about machine, nevertheless, when they start to a new job and they face to real machines, they look machine a creature because they have lack of experience how this machine work. We know that they have knowledge about many theories which are related to machines and they recognize many rules about science, yet, they are unsufficient in using them since the lesson in their department are too systematic and theoretical.
It is seen this common problem not only in mechanical engineer but also at the all fields all engineer department. The lessons about rules and theory are given academically (only on the black board) . It is expected to pass these visas, but, these departments dont give chance for practicing in real situation except thirty days for training about their field, indeed, it is not enough for education during four or five years.
The another example is that many new graduated teachers encounter many difficulty in practicing at real teaching because even though they have enough knowledge about the psychology of children, how to teach and how to use materials effectively, they have lock of experience about teaching in real school with students, in a real situation and real life. Suddenly, they face to crowded classes and many kinds of students such as extrovert, introvert, even hyperactive. These situations are rather difficult, there fore, knowledge is not sufficient for starting new job without experience.
The other reason is that some visas requires having unnecessary knowledge thus students have to study for learning some term which are not used during their life. Even if they have to use these terms, they look at their books so it is not a must to recite them. For instance, in geology engineer department a lot of students recite a lot of name of mineral or they learn the features of stone for their mineralogy, sendimantology, tectonic lessons. Indeed, they need the knowledge for their real job in future such as learning digging exploratory well, making tunnel, examining fracture lines, nonetheless, they dont have change to examine these materials and subjects about their job in real world.
Nevertheless, the visas certainly have some useful features. First of all, if there is not visa system, the student cant be evaluated accurately. It wont be clear that students are ready to be graduated from or not. Also, it will be to difficult to decided who students are successful or not. Foe examples in educated department, the students have lesson about pedagogy to acquire knowledge about psychology and learning of student. It can be evaluated who have lesson in education department by means of visas and final exams or else it will be unclear to decide the success of students.
The other good features of the visa system that students have to study for fear that they can pass the exam so the students want to learn lessons for having good mark to be graduated from university. After exams, students have change to learn which lessons is learnt or not, thus, they notice their strengths or weaknesses about their subjects.
To sum up, university degree is a necessity for having job, however, it is not enough in real world because of the some negative features of visa system. It should be asked necessary subject related to their job in real world at the visas also students should not learn unnecessary knowledge instead of practicing in their job. Nevertheless, it should not be forgot the importance of exams at the evaluating the success and qualifications of students.
In conclusion, the university degree will be accepted a real value for the real world if the lessons and visas are consisted with real life.

We are living in a very big world as a human beings. There are many new things which appear every second in our life as a technology, science, math, etc. . . So we must be ready for all those conditions to adapt easily without hesitating . In this section, the universities enter and play an important role in our life for adaptation. They have got many aims but one of their most essential aim must be include to prepare quality graduates. Now, we will analize whether the universities have these approaches or not.
In our country or in abroad there are billions of universities which have got billions of students. Each person goes to university for different purposes. These aims can be to have a job, to have knowledge for the rest of their life or to earn money. Here, maybe the most important idea comes to the minds like these companies prepare their customers to the real life or not. When we ask this question to students we got many responses. Some of them said that they were given enough information for the future and the education was not only therotical . However there are some similar answers, a large number of student claimed that the education was not good to be ready for every circumstances in their coming life.
They have got some reasons to have an thought like the universities are not enough. First of all, they argue that they have not got any modern lab as a visual aids. Even though they learn theoretical information it is meaningless without doing any practice in labs or in any other conditions. Some of them also added however there are some labs but they are not equipped with the machines of their fields. Morever there are not enough seats to sit down, they can not attend to the classes . This condition is really serious for a university because the meaning of education must include every circumstances and be able to give every single knowledge to the students. So, the labs must be an important issue and donated according to the recent improvements in technology. Especially the students of Engineer Department claim that a lot of problems are waiting for them when they graduate.
When we continue to talk with students we meet with a different subject which is related again with the little value of universities. They said some unnecessary lessons make them busy, so they spend their time with meaningless subjects. According to them, these kinds of lessons are just for doing something silly. In addition to this they said when they look at the subjects in textbook they can not see any useful information which are related with their department. Also when midterm or final exams come they have to memorize all those things for nothing.
If we continue to ask the same question , maybe we will get similar or same
answers. Therefore the universities claim that they have not got enough capital, it must not be a reason. The world needs human beings who are aware of their environment and be ready for every chancing. As a conclusion we do not see defending people with the events, in contrast logical and smart people who adapt themselves to every conditions. Knowledge might not be only therotical but also practical.

What do you feel after fifteen yeared dense educations if someone comes and tells you that your education had little value? Because I think so and categorise my reasons in three main groups, first according to the knowledge, second according to the insufficiencies, third students knowledge transfer and educational system in Turkey.
From age to age the most valuable thing of the world is changed for example in 19th century, industry is the most valuable thing in the world who had it is the power with its advantages but in 20th century it was knowledge who had knowledge that the others dont know is the power and today knowledge is not important alone. On the other hand the experience is becoming more important. only the ones who can combine knowledge and experience will have future. A good example to show how important the combination of these is when one applies for a job first of all he or she asked for experience or if there are two people for a job the boss prefers experienced one instead of the other one who just graduated from university.
Also the knowledge people took in universities do not get on with reality so we can name these knowledge as unnecessary. The main aim of the education is to give students the knowledge which is suitable for them and can be use in daily life. But today education is far from this aim, a well known example to this to teach students digest system of frogs. Another good example that we observe in universities, learners of zoology department memorize many unnecessary things like they never use in their daily or business life.
Second main reason is the insufficiencies of the education. We can also divide it into two. In order to increase the productivity of education in many departments of universities the sources are more important especially for engineering students but there is a lack of source for instance in ukurova University there are only two laboratories that can be used by machine engineering. So in this situation we can not expect student to get the ability to use knowledge in practical.
Another insufficiency can be observed while teacher presenting lessons. The usage of inadequacy or not appropriate methods. Instead of let the students learn doing or living. Teachers use classical methods like direct speech method.
Thirdly, students can not transfer their accusations to practical. Because our university education is mostly depend on out. In theory while we follow them right and learn the latest researches. In usual life conditions we can not reach them so this create an in harmony between theory and practise and it does or shows taken knowledge as unimportant.
We can accept the features of education system in Turkey as our last reason. Many teachers of us say do not memorize instead of it just try to learn.  Because it is very easy to forget what is memorized. But in Turkey the education system is totally depend on memorization most of the students can not pass the other steps of  like comprehension analysing and synthesis. Because of this problem many students graduated from universities with little knowledge. Many countries arrange their education philosophy according to the question how can we educate free minded and productive generations?  The answers of this question shape the education. In Turkey education philosophy is based on theory. For instance what the books or teachers say are exactly true and can not be change so when the real world have differences with what students learned, they shocked.
Consequently I think the little value of knowledge , insufficiency in education , students can not transfer their accusations to practice and the features of education system in Turkey make the statement most university degrees are theoretical and do not prepare students for real world. They are therefore of little value.  If we get rid of these problems in a systematic way , it is not impossible to educate productive generations.

Universities are educational institutions at the highest level, where you study for a degree. They have an important and a key role in a society because universities create sophisticated and well-educated individuals who have the spirit of research. In order to achieve this, universities have two essential duties: 
* Education
* Research
Universities provide students necessary education atmosphere with a wide range of degrees. These courses of study are very useful for students. Yet, it is argued that university degrees are theoretical and have little value. Therefore they do not prepare students for real life.
To some extent it may true but I do not agree entirely to this matter. University degrees not only give the knowledge of science but also improve the students abilities. They also give the students the chance of noticing their capacities. They prepare students for the real life by giving the opportunities of using their knowledge in the fields that they study.
For instance, I am a student at English Language Teaching Department in the Education Faculty of ukurova University. My courses are both theoretical and practical. I have to use both of them effectively in my future life. As I will become a foreign language teacher, I have to improve myself on a large scale in my job. Theoretical lessons help me to develop my knowledge about the subjects. I have to be good at linguistics, I have to know the cultures of different countries and also I have to become aware of the features of my country such as its geography, history, literature etc. Of course these are all concerned with scientific ideas not with practical experiences. However, in order to become successful in my practical experiences, I have to be well-grounded in my field with this science. The more I know about the matters or I get the information which I need from these courses, the more I use them in my practical courses sufficiently.
This year we have a course named Educational Technology and Materials Development. Since it is a practical course we present some materials such as pictures, charts videos etc . that we produce for students in a class. In order to create an excellent learning environment in schools and make the learning fun for students we try to stimulate their all senses. Before this lesson, I have to be so well- versed in my theoretical courses that I can use my knowledge about grammars and also my creativeness for the learning aids and resources.
As a second example I want to mention about one of the other theoretical courses in ukurova University, psychology. I think it is one of the most important courses I took during my educational period. It is helper to understand people and their behavior against to situations, a guide that explains students mental and moral matters, a way that I follow to provide permanent learning. I will try to use my knowledge of this field on my students.
The other faculties in ukurova University have those both degrees. Like us they use their knowledge in their practical experiences and they graduated from here as a well-educated people.
Then, research is indispensable element for universities. As we all know, the best education is to learn a work by doing yourself. In order to learn a matter deeply, you make successful research for it and you will gain the knowledge of this matter as well as self-confident . You can unite your research and knowledge for your practical degree. It helps improve yourself both psychologically and mentally. Universities also provide us suitable class environment full of with necessary equipment, laboratories for the practical activities and libraries for the theoretical degrees.
To sum up, universities are very important units which constitute a societys educational system. They purpose to grow up individuals well-educated and useful for their community. In order to provide a good education they use both theoretical and practical courses in their system. These all prepare the students for the real life and for the good future of a society.
Universities with all areas interact with industry, private and public foundations and social sciences. They grow up the students according to their demands and needs. They explains qualifications of individuals they need and universities try to realize their necessities by presenting the students knowledge of sciences and practices. Also it is argued that these foundations use these humans experiences sufficiently and in an appropriate way. In spite of these , universities work hardly in order to make a good future for a society with their well-educated individuals and will always make his job forever . . .

In all nations and education systems. universities are one of the favourite topics which are always criticized. Some says university degrees are therotical. some says not. But to say that they have totally little value in our lives will be a very faulty belief. Therefore. there are some points that explain us why they can be therotical and some points that prove us having a university degree a good helper all time. In this study . you will see all these points related to both of these sides from perspective of a university student.
When we look at its positive sides. firs of all. we see that therotical lessons must be included in evey department. It is nonsense to think that university students should only learn practical lessons. Of course. we study our lessons therotically. and the area we will practice them will be our lives. For example. in ELT Department. there are some pedegogial lessons. in which we learn about psychology. especially psychology of students. Since we will be english teachers. we will practice them in schools. If we dont have enough knowldge. what will happen in the future. in our bussiness life. So. theory means that enlarging knowledge about our own area and practice means that applying these knowledge into real life.
Another side. which prove us university degrees are not therotical. is that a peson have to know all the details of his/her job. Again for our department. only knowing the language is not enough itself. We have to know literature and cultue of the country that we teach its language. Practicing these in our lessons will be very benefical during our teaching life after the university.
Also. there is one more positive aspect of having univesity degree. Universities are a good chance to enrich our knowledge about life. A person graduates from univesity with a lot of expeinces; not only about his/her profession. but also about people and social life. In our country. a freshman comes to school about 18-20 years old so this is the first step of him to real life. He experiences living far away from his family. He learns how to struggle against life on his own. He meets a lot of people and lives a lot of thing with them. He transfer new information from them to his own pesent life and keep some of them to use in his future life. Because of all these reasons. it will be wrong to think that having university degree has little value. and doesnt prepare us to real life.
On the other hand. if some conditions musnt be provided. university degrees become therotical. First condition is that. lessons given in universities have to be suitable to the nations characteristics. in which univesity is settled down. For instence. in our department. we have Material Development lesson. In this lesson. we learn preparing materials suitable for classes contain 20 or 30 student. In contrast. in Turkey it is almost impossible to have classrooms in this number so we will never use information that we learn in this lesson.
Second condition is that . some departments need some equepments. If goverment doesnt provide them these tools. teching university becomes therotical. For example. Could it be thought that a computer engineering department without computers? What will do they in the lessons? Only they get some infomation from their books and unfortunately. since they dont know how to use information. they will fail in real life. And people among them think that going to university useless. university graduates dont know any thing.
Thirdly. a university has to change itself accoding to time. While eveything is changing and new things are being invented. for a university staying at the same point with same information will be a big demolition for its students. If a student gain new things from shool. it will be easier for him to practice them in real life. But if university give him infomation from his big . big grandparents time . it will be end both university and student. Because he got therotical knowledge from university which he never use. And again university become therotical and its degree will have little value in students life.
As a conclusion. universities are not valueless institutions that never prepare their graduates for real life. It is us that make universities therotical. When we nation and goverment-give enough importance toour universities . we will have sophisticated university graduates who have enough knowledge about their job and life.

TRCU1136,2.5,3.0,,,,,"In the words of the old song: ""Money is the root of all evil""","
For centuries, millions of people have died, killed and suffered for money. I strongly agree with the idea that money is the root of all evil. However, there is a crucial point that shouldn't be denied : the reason that makes money evil is the inevitable necessity of it. It is impossible in this world to survive without money. You can't be cured if you are ill, you can't eat anything if you are hungry and you can't sleep in a warm place. Money is vital.
All the people, from birth to death, struggle throughout their lives. We struggle for success, for social statue, for prestige or for love. Nevertheless, in my opinion, the main reason for people's struggle is money, because it lies behind the all aspects of life. Some of my friends, for example, who were very poor and unsuccessful as a student in secondary school, have now become very successful businessmen for the fact that they were very rich as an individual. I am going to be a teacher and their social statue will always be higher than me. The reason is not that they are more clever but that they have much more money. They will also be very prestigious throughout their lives. As all these are the struggles of life, so it means that we are, in fact, struggling for money. Most people may reject but, in my opinion, this is also valid for love as well. Especially in our time, money goes beyond love. Many people cannot reach the ones that they love as they don't have enough money.
Many other people don't even look at the ones who are not as rich as them. Also in some other situations, many people cannot be together even if they love each other for the sake of financial problems. If money can kill love, then it is indisputable that it is evil.
People need money at every step of their lives because the more money they have the more powerful they are. This begins from very young ages. We can see it even among children. The children of rich people are usually more extrovert, more dominant and more active ones in schools. Which of us don't want his/her child to be such a student in school? Hence, we all need money. In adolescence, we feel the need for money a little bit more, because this is the first time that we need money for ourselves as individuals. We become aware of the importance of his money deeply. The ones who have little money suffer so much in these ages. They face the evil side of the money for the first time. Later on, when it is time to earn your own living, then things become complexer and harder, because unfortunately, the ones who don't need money can find very good, prestigious and comfortable jobs while the others probably can't even find a job. Such people's need for money often lead them to different, dark 
and sorrowful roads. Lastly, when we get older and our body gets tired, some health problems come out. Rich people can go any where they want to look for the cure of their diseases, whereas the poor don't even be diagnosed as they can't go to a doctor. Money problem don't leave you even if you die. As we all know, it is not cheap to bury a dead.
For me, money makes people more selfish also. Think of a person who doesn't have any money. Can you imagine that she/he can go on living with the help of other people throughout his/her life. Of course there are some people who help poor people but I don't believe that a person who has no money and no home can be helped forever. No one wants to share his/her money with someone else because everybody crucially needs money in life. I don't think that anybody would reject the benefit that she/he will have with even a little bit more money. All the people are so concerned with the more money which they need that they cannot think of the people who have less money than them. They always think of richer people and are always eager to be richer. Almost nobody cares about the poorer people and has the feeling of sharing.
Consequently, I can say that at every step we make and each stage we take in life, we need money. It is so vital for people that one feels that she/he can do anything to reach it. This makes money the root of all evil.

Money can be anything that is generally and universally accepted for the payment of goods services or debts. Money is almost as old as recorded history. We can not live without money but we should know that it is an item to buy things. Firstly people change the things this means they give something that they have and take something that they need. As years pass this system becomes complicated and they invent money. Now money is one of the most important thing in our life. We use it to buy food, wear, travel and live in good conditions. Anyway while money is providing us these easiness, it can also give us harm. The more money you want to make, the more trouble you are in.
Money affects people much. They can do bad things to make more money. People always want more and more and to make more money they can do anything. They can steal money from someone, rub a bank, break into a house and take money on jewellery even kill a person to get his money. They do these things just for the money. Because earning money is not easy but people want to earn it in easy ways and become rich immediately. The willing of becoming suddenly rich make people do these things. For example if a person doesnt have a job to earn money, what will he do? He thinks that he should commit suicide or steal some money from someone. He thinks these things because he is lack of money. If he commits suicide, he will put an end to his own life and escape from problems. Or if he steals money from somebody, it will be a crime that he does for money. Otherwise, a rich person can mistakes about this. For example as he thinks that he has lots of money, he begins to gamble and enjoy himself every 
night so he neglect his family and responsibilities. Addition to this, his relationship with his family gets worse and worse. He can also loose the things that he has, including his family. At this point, money is the root of all evil.
Money is necessary for education. If a person hasnt got enough money for his education, he can not got to school or university so he wont able to have a job to earn money. There are many people who are very clever and successful in their lessons but they cant continue their education just because they dont have enough money for their education. Money is also necessary for our health. For example a person has a serious illness but he can not be cured because he has no money. If he has enough money to be cured, he can go to the best hospital to get well. At this point, money sometimes brings happiness. For example; by money you can have a good education, you can spend it on your own health problems and you can live in better conditions or you can buy anything what you and your family want. But sometimes it doesnt bring happiness. Money is important and its necessary to live but it shouldnt be the meaning of life. There are some concepts that are more important than the money; these are 
respect, success, health and love. If a person healthy, he can work and earn money. If he works hard and respects to the other people in his office, he can be successful in his work. In addition to this, if he loves someone, this means that he can enough money to live. I remember a story about this topic. There is a fisherman and his wife. They live happily in their small cottage by the sea. One day he comes across a fish and it says to the fisherman that it can do everything whatever he wants. First day he wants a very beautiful house, second day a car, third day some food, fourth day a farm, fifth day some animals, sixth day a country. He owns all these things but they are not as happy as they are in old days. They dont love and respect to each other anymore, even they dont trust. At the end of the eighth day he looses everthing that he gains. Suddenly he finds himself and his wife in their old, small cottage. The fish does this as a punishment.
Finally, money is one of the most important thing in our life, this reality can not be refused. But people shouldnt be addicted to money. If they are, they can do anything to gain more money in a some easy ways. We should only use it as an item. We shouldnt let the money become the root of all evil.

Money is one of the most important item in the world. Wherever you are, it so necessary for the people, live in different part of the world. Not only does it useful for the people but it also has lots of disadvantages for them. For some reasons; 
Firstly, it influences psychology of the people. If someone does not have enough money to live, she/he has tendency to do bad events. For example, I read a news on the newspaper about a man who killed his friend because of the money. Or there are lots of people who are theaf. They may steal something from a house or from a bank or from a jeweler. Or there are lots of people who steal bags of girls. I remember that someone had stolen one of my friends bag. There were all money, telephone, lots of credit cards and ticket which is necessary to go to hometown. She was upset because she stays in the dormitory, she lives away her family, she is a student. They steal wallets of someone. Someone may be a student, a retired who takes three months salary or may be a woman or a man who needs money. If a person does not have enough money to live, her/his eyes becomes blind, he or she can not see anything because of bad pyschology, she/he can make everything.
Secondly, money provides unequal between peple such as education and health. If you have lots of money, you and your family have got sufficient opportunity to live well. For example you can send your children to special schools, special schoolrooms. Special schools have got lots of technology such as computer, TV. , cassettes, type recorder, slides, OHP, good teachers who have enough knowledge for the students. Because of this reasons, her/his education becomes well. But if you do not have money, you send your children a school instead of special school not having lots of technology but having crowded classroom, so his /her education becomes worst. Or when you become ill, you can go special hospital, special doctor so you can get over quickly but if you do not have money to take medicine, you can lose your life. There is unequal situations between the people living same country.
Thirdly, the more you have got money the more you can be an evil. Although you are rich, you want to be richest man in your country. You do bad events to live wealth. For example, we see lots of people who cheat goverment. They ignore the profits of his own countrys goverments, they just ignore the profits of himself. I see that Cem Uzan cheated Nokia and Motorola on TV. to live wealth. Or there are lots of people who buy drag to innocent people, to youth, to students to have lots of money providing good life without working.
Finally, the more you have got money the more you are unhappy. For example, famous actor and actrees are not really happy in their own world. They do not have own real life and they do not live like one of the people. When they want to walk on the road in their city, journalists do not leave them alone. They do not go whenever they want or they go but they are with journalists, camera, photographs, flash bulb. They get bored that life because of not having special life. For example, Yeim Salkm does not want to stay in Turkey thats why her life is examined carefully by the journalists so she does not have own life. She said that she could not stay in own country because of gossip making on TV. or on the newspapers. Also, they do not live real friendship and real love. They do not know whether they have got real friendship, love or not. Money does not bring happiness to them.
We can not live without money and we are not happy with lots of money. Money! Money! Money! When it is lots or little, money is the root of all evil.

Almost all people believe If they have too much money, that is the happiest event in the world for them. However, almost all of us can not know money is useful or harmful for the people. What is the money? Is each rich person happy in the world? Or Is each poor person sorry for not having money? Since we can not decide it is good or bad. Why do we stil want too much money? In my opinion, If people dont know how they use money in a good way, It is the just roof of all evil. Also, there are several reasons for moneys being the roof of all evil for me such as peoples unability to use the money in a good way, peoples esteeming to the money instead of human and the people who are nouveau riche.
First reason of moneys being the roof of all evil is peoples unability to use the money in a good way. You know so many rich people in the world who do not share their money anytime with any poor people. Most time, even if they know that there is a poor person who needs money very much, they do not give any money. Although they have quintillions, they dont want to give just one million as if they will be a poor person when they give this money. However, they can spend their money, easily in a bar, a party or for entertainment. They do not think poor peoples life. . Retired teacher Mehmet waits in the bank queue for taking one billion for three months. It isnt important for this kind of rich peopleOld Ahmet uncle waits in the hospital queue for hours and the doctor invites him to his private hospital and one day, old Ahmet uncle 
dies for not having enough money. However, It is not important for the rich person, againElif aunt sells pullover which she knits herself, but nobody wants to buy them. In the night, she turns her house without money like three days. It is not important for the rich people again and again. . You can ask me: What do the rich people do for that? They can not help all poor people. And also the money is their own money. They gain this money themselves. I do not say that they give their all money to the poor people; thetefore, all people will be equal without working. . It is nonsence, anyway. I mean, If each rich person helps a poor person, we can develop with all people. If all rich people have conscience, there will be no class difference, and poor people will not steal, poor people do not kill anybody for taking his-her money. In that position, the poor will love the rich, and the rich will love the poor.
Second reason for moneys being the root of all evil is peoples esteeming to the money instead of human. Today, we almost all try to imitate the west people instead of getting our own culture. Especially, the rich think that money is the most important thing in the world and they try to do almost all thing for gaining money.
However, when they try to gain money, they become to forget some good behaviours or feelings such as respect, peace or love. They believe If they have too much money, they can do whatever they want. They can buy a perfect or they can buy a wanderful house or they can buy everything they want, but they forget that they can not buy happiness using their money. You can see some rich families. Parents give their daughter or boy everything they want, but they forget to give them love. Then you can hear this simple question from the father or mother. I give you everything you want. Why arent you happy?  And boy or daughters simple answer: You have given me all thing except love Of course, they are simple sentences, but these events are real. The rich forget human rights. Since they are used to do everything they want, immediately, they 
dont respect the other peoples feelings and If there is no respect to the other people, it means there is no love in the world.
Third reason for moneys being the roof of all evil is the people who  riche. This kind of people are very different. They damage both themselves and the other people. Micheal Jackson is one of this kind of people. He was one of nine children of a poor family. He just had two-bedroomed house when he become rich, he bought a house which had seventeen rooms downstairs and sixteen rooms upstairs. There were a golf course, a football pitch, a swimming pool, tenis courts in his garden. Then he had so many operations for being handsome, but these operations were harmful for him. However, he wasnt interested in the damage of the operations, because he had too much money. He slept inside an oxygen capsule to live longer. Today, his face is very bad because of so many operations. He can not sing. He fells afraid in crowds and he has different 
strange behaviours.
Consequently; although almost all people believe that  Money is happiness, It gets so many bad things. Therefore; there is only one thing to say: Money is the roof of all evil.

I am a university student in ELT Faculty and next year I will be an English teacher. I have passed all my exams successfully and I have studied to my lessons regularly, I have finished one of my probationary period effectively, and the most important thing that I have done is I have seen my teachers (professors) as a model for me and I have listened all of them carefully. According to all these striking explanations I will be really a good teacher for my students. Do not panic! Because it is just a dream and the nightmare is going also in my university education. Just I want to learn that where is our ( students ) murderer, who is responsible for having nothing in our poor hands after graduating from approximately 18-20 yeared education? A clear and simple answer is looking forward us, this is theory-based education! 
From the beginning of primary school education till the university education we are exaggerately exposed to full of knowledge into our minds. In primary school, while we are trying to find our abilities and interests, we encounter just the term knowledge like a very strong wall. Our teachers do not give up this enjoyable storage work, they go on writing the rules about all the lesson into our white, empty minds until we come to high school. In high school, all of us almost like an expert about memorizing the information for using them in university enterance exam. Of course, so far at least sometimes our teachers or another words our educaton system have showed some practical exercises. For example, in the lesson of science we have gone to the lab for doing experiment and we just have watched carefuly our teachers abilities about experiment. It gave us really big experience for our 
daily life! 
Somehow, we passed the university exam and started to wait a different education or fairy shining brightly on us.
First of all, some of our victim of destiny discovered that they are in wrong faculty, since no one directs them while studying, actually , they are not aware of their skills or interests and so far they did not have the chance to encounter their abilities in their schol life. Another of us go on filling our minds with unuseful informations and it is doubtful that these informations are whether make a contribution to our profession or not Then? Our country starts to have lots of incapable graduate young people in their professions. For example, your son is graduated from the engineering faculty without knowing how to repair even just a wall-plug. However, if your son does not learn theory-based information and instead of this, if he has practical education in school, he can repair it. More worse thing is in that point, those poor graduate young people are not finding a job because of their insufficiency. For instance, in the factories, managers are looking for experienced worker (engineer or something else) , they are not giving much importance to your university degree and they are paying attention to your skills and if you do not know exactly how to do something practically and you do not have enough self-confidence, you loose your chance. They give your chance just to a person who is not graduated from university but has worked for years as an apprentice. At that point, our teachers can say that you have a probationary period and you can learn. I think they are not aware of our difficulties in this period. Probationer students usually seen like a seller of tea in the factories or offices, they do unimportant works and things-bring-take works and nobody makes them courageous in their profession, nobody does not do any extra favor for them because there is 
uselessness in our society in a contagious way. Nobody takes care anyboy. For example, in my probationary period, I tried to learn some teaching methods from the model teacher, she behaved us as if she were a proffesor or very experienced teacher and at that point I had lost all of my passion about learning something from her.
The other crucial factors that affecting our education very much are the features of our professors, suitable classes, appropriate physical atmospheres and materials. All these factors should be meet by the universities. The university education should motivate us effectively, it should make initiative in the society and we should be graduated from universities all our self-confidence and sufficiency in our professions.
Finally, lets not just say we should improve or bring our country to the highest pitch.  We should be more realistic and practise good and elaborated education system to our generation. Give up talking and closing your eyes and try to see the murderer. Otherwise all your young generation will be worse and you will not be able to save your future!

Every year millions of students study hard for an important exam which is called university exam. Students get very nervous and excited for this exam, because besides its difficulties very small amounts of students are chosen. Then here comes the university life for the people who have success and good marks. Being successful in the exam is not a final step, it is just the first step towards to real world. But how much do you think the degrees of these universities prepare students for this real world? These degrees are divided into two groups, theoretical and practical. Compared to being theoretical, being practical is more advantageous because of some reasons.
Theory is general principles or ideas of a subject and sometimes it is not proved to be true. Since the life is full of disadvantages the students should know more than theory that is given in universities. Most university degrees which is a course of study at university or college are theoretical and do not prepare students for the real world. Although everything starts with its theories, practice is more important and needed, because the students have to use in the real world the things they have learned. They have to put it into the real world. The students should do some regular activities in order to improve their skills. So they need to spend a period of time in training to improve their skills. Because of this reason theories have to be put into practice. If the students are prepared theoretical during university education they might have difficulties in putting these theories into the practice in the real world. This lack of practice affects their success while performing their jobs. They can not concentrate and do not know what to do, so they need to spend some time to do everything properly. Because of this they waste their time in learning how to practice and how to be good at the profession. On the other hand some faculties, for example faculty of education prepare students practically. They see and practice how to teach by doing variety of presentation activities in the classrooms and by going to schools to be trained. In these schools they observe the teachers and the students, the way they teach, act in the class and their behaviors towards to the students, but how many of these faculties do the universities have? What should universities do about this problem is another question. They should be more careful about the practice, and they should take an action to renew the system.
The universities should involve in practical degrees more than theoretical degrees. They should take an action to renew the education system. Maybe it is very difficult to build something new, but the system needs to be revised for the future, because the students are the future of this country and they are going to save the world. The more important thing is that they are going to save their lives to have a better future.

Although, there is a thought that most university degrees are theoretical and do not prepare students for the real world, we shouldnt ignore the advantages of these degrees.
There is a common belief that universities are not the place where students can benefit from them and be prepared for the real life. Some people even think that it is a waste of time. So, instead of studying for many years in universities, having a job after high school and beginning to work, gain his or her own money is more advantageous. Thus, people earn their living in this way. As a result, they become producer rather than consumer and they dont have to be dependent especially in terms of money on their family.
On the other hand, we must take this fact into consideration that without any education, without any background knowledge, without any background knowledge, without any theoretical information, we cant reach a fruitful conclusion. I mean being well-educated makes you more qualified and more superior one. In other words, these features differentiate you from other people. Especially, if there is a close correlation between your department in the university and your occupation, your job that you will have in the future, at that time, your university degree can work. In other words, even if most university degrees are theoretical, you can transfer these theoric information into your job. For example, before trying to write this essay, I asked some of my friends who are studying at Translation Department about this issue and they say that they are much more different from the new beginners. They are now good at translation than before beginning to university. Some people may think that it is possible or easy to translate any passage or text if you have a dictionary, but the situation is not the same they think, I believe. Because they learn and study not only to translate with only a dictionary but also different ways and styles of translating any passage. They learn some approaches, techniques and methods to do this job perfectly and professionally as far as they can. They learn professional names, I mean people who are known as a leader for this job and try to follow these ways while dealing with their studies.
A student should think and try to draw conclusions on whichever lesson he is taking. If  the student is interested in the subject he will as himself what is the point of this lesson and how can I use this knowledge to make it valuable, but if he is not interested in the field he will think that the lessons have even no value. He will not ask the questions ,that I have mentioned above, to himself and he will find the lessons unpurposeful.
I believe even theoretical lessons have a purpose and value. The most important point is to find how we can use the knowledge in our life to make it valuable. If you are interested in the field drawing conclusions and seeing the purpose of the lessons will not be hard for you, but you are not interested it will probably turn into a hell studying for the lesson and thinking on them. What I am trying tom say it is in our hands to make a knowledge valuable or not. We just need to make it clear: interested or not? Furthermore, these degrees provide you higher status and more money. As a result, I believe that nothing is unnecessary to get university degree.

TRME3002,3.5,,,,,,Most university degrees are theoretical and do not prepare students for the real world. They are therefore of very little value,"
Most students dream in high school is to enter a university. Because they want to have both theoretical and practical knowledge that is necessary for their job and they want to be ready for the life. Therefore students study harder pass the exam and enter the university. Their dream comes true. But, in fact they arent aware that they will have many problems which need to be dealt with. They see that university education or the university life in their mind is only an utopian. I want to explain it from two aspects. Firstly most university degrees give only theoretical knowledge. Secondly students satisfy the knowledge that is given. They dont improve themselves.
From the theoretical aspect of the problem, I can argue that most university degrees stock the knowledge in students mind. Before students comprehend and categorize, them in their mind new one is given theoretically. Students memorize dont know how to practice knowledge that is given them at the university. Students are given unnecessary knowledge and directed to memorize them rather than learn. As a result newly learned things are located in the short memory and then they fly away. Therefore, this situation constitutes an insufficient background of knowledge for the university education. For that reason there are people who know everything about their job but dont show in practice their knowledge. In order to prevent students from learning something. Temporarily, they should be taken away from memorizing unless its application is really needed. The more they memorize, the more time they waste. Also, the more they memorize, the less they learn new things permanently. As they can not learn things easily, 
their aim becomes just studying for the exams and getting good marks. I think this must be the last goal of the educational system. So, there should be another ways of making lessons more attractive and easily understandable. In order to achieve this, students should be given a chance to put into practice what they learn.
The second aspect is that students are satisfied with what they learn. Students take the knowledge that is given by their teacher in their school and they dont add new things their knowledge. It is enough for them. They dont make research. They do not think to expand their knowledge on that subject. They do not even look for other books. A student model which makes research and improve him/herself from different aspects is not seen. They only listen, take notes and memorize them for the exam and then forget that notes. The result is obvious. The students graduate with insufficient knowledge. When they enter working life, they suffer because they are not equipped with enough knowledge to deal with problems.
Consequently most university degrees are theoretical and do not prepare students for the real world as education in universities is inadequate for real life and students do find themselves with the problems which they cant overcome. I think that an individual graduated from a university should be self-reliant, creative, researcher and civilized to feel ready, isnt he?

At most universities, there is a problematic issue that whether the courses given are sufficient enough to prepare a student to real world. How much value does the education carry out in the universities, or are they only theoretical are the questions, which should be argued on it.
We cannot totally claim that all of lessons are theoretical, so what is acquired by students do not have any importance. However, most of them really have little necessity to use in our daily life. In addition, theoretical lessons are always come boring and uninteresting for students. Therefore, they do not thoroughly pay their attention in that kind of course. As they engage in more abstract subjects, most importantly they do not apply their knowledge in real situations and conditions; they cannot keep them in their mind in long term. Also, the lecturer covers these lessons ignorantly; they do not give any effort to make lessons more bearable visa versa more unbearable. These situations lead decreasing the value, importance of the lessons, which are theoretical. Even if they include crucial matters, it can be neglected by students. So whats the use? What is the main aim of having theoretical lessons if it will not carry out any value in the future for students? In Turkey, we can give the examples of 
History and Turkish lessons given compulsory in the first year of university education in all departments. The first year university students, already had these courses from the beginning of their school life, expect something different when they take these courses. However when they have observed no difference between the high school and university teaching style, they are a bit disappointed and I think these courses loose their importance for the young. I agree the idea that these course itself theoretical and what can be done for them are limited. However, when searched on it for a while, we can find many different activities to use in that lessons, For ex; in History lessons, we might get the students to find information on a particular subject and find historical clothes related to the subject. Then they will perform it in the class as a role-playing activity. This activity will help the students understand the subject better, enjoy in the classroom and benefit from this information in any condition, as the subject is more permanent and clearer for them then.
On the other hand, as I mentioned before I cannot completely accept that they are not beneficial for human being. These courses can provide on individual to improve himself personally. Having even little information on every subject, help a person to think about and comment on different issues more critically. These peoples point of view differs from others as they dont look at issues from a borrow perspective. The mother here is, if these theoretical lesson may play a big role in a persons life, why dont we give an extra effort to get them realize the importance of these courses. Why always it is said these are rule on structure you have to learn it in the only solution for the students. For every course, this is a well-know criterion any more memorization never means learning. Real learning occurs only by the means of experiencing. Experiencing a subject is ten times better for a person than memorizing it. It is not only for courses even in every life conditions. For that reasons, we shouldnt make 
our students to memorize what is written on the books especially in theoretical lessons if we really want to help them.
When we look at other sight, we can find lessons, which really prepare students to real life at universities. For ex; in Education Faculty, there is a school-experiencing course. As the teacher candidates involve in a real situation there, as they mainly interact with real student, objects, conditions, they can understand the situation better and apply what they learned more easily. When time passes, students can feel more comfortable and self-confident. After a while, they become experienced, and will be sure that they can do their job without fear.
As a conclusion, theoretical lessons shouldnt be considered less important than actually they are. If they are lectured, taught in a way that students can understand, then there will be no problem for both students and teachers. Also these lessons will gain their real value in the real life

Universities, as we all know, are the intuitions that supply a power of human, in many fields, to the society that they live in. A university student has the chance to learn about his or her personal development, environment, society they live in. In universities, there are many social activities for students that they can enjoy in their free time. Also psychological field help students to overcome their problems whenever they want. Beside, this institution help students to see what he wants to see or what he wants to do. But, all the while, many of us think that university degrees are theoretical and do not preparing students to the real life .Therefore they are of little value. If so, what can be done? Both as students and teachers. In my opinion, university is the place or institution that has pink clouds covering it, as real life requires many responsibilities. Being a student gives us the feeling that you dont need to search for something, you will have to teach. I can say that, as a student, we dont 
like searching for something or trying to know, just somebody will give the order and then we try to learn about it or search for it. So if a graduated university student doesnt have any or enough knowledge about everything, this not only the fault of the system but also the students. For me there is no lesson that is useful to the student. All the informations are, even the minor ones that are seen unimportant, are the chains of each other. Maybe the problem is the way we teach a lesson. Its the teachers turn to make the lesson funny or boring! I want to give example from myself: in prep class I had a listening&speaking lesson. In high school almost most of us did not have any speaking activity. Grammar was the only skill that we deal with, but in my prep and first year this lesson was the most interesting lesson for me. I was finding some documents from internet and presenting them. The teacher didnt want me to speak unvoluntarily, she just give me a chance to speak and i have tried to use it in the way that is beneficial me now and in the future. Beside developing my speaking skill i have learned how to control my anger in front of the people in the class. Also i have learned many useful and interesting things from the documents that I searched from internet.  will be an English language teacher but i do not want to be a typical one-giving a lecture, quizzing.  want to teach my students maybe funny, interesting or useful thing about the language they learn. So this lesson is related with real life, I think.  also want to give an example from my second year: Language Acquisition lesson seemed to me a boring lesson but time passed and  began to understand the beneficial point of this lesson. It helped me to understand how the language is acquired by new born babies and adults. I have to little nephew and  can see their language development by the help of this lesson. I can say the same thing for the other lessons: Literature and Culture helps me to understand or learn about the people whose language Im learning and so on... Shortly, I dont think that the university lessons have little value. You may not use it tomorrow but there will be a time to use it. These lessons are related with people and I will be a teacher, means I will be with people. University teaches me to be able to think from other perspective, to look from other peoples side. The way of life and the lessons complete each other and this is what makes university beneficial...

Universities are science associations. They are of help with the individual development and also give some technical information related to the profession. These main aims are very different from each other. Shortly, having all necessary information about a certain profession and a persons emotions and ideas development are very different from each others.
I think, the process of the individual development that a university provides the people is meant General Education. General Education is a persons development bodily. It is to be able to determine to his aims in the life, become civilized and tell his opinions freely. It is to have an opinion about an event and development and to develop these ideas.
In my opinion, everything which is taught to the people about the life is Culture Education. One of the things which Culture Education teaches to the people is the universty. There are many profits of this education; being an experienced person, thinking development, being respectful to the different ideas and people, 
A persons first duty is to be able to recognize himself. The university helps people to recognise themselves and also their idiosyncrasies, hobbies, phobias, capasities, logical and emotional powers, understanding competences. So people go to the university through these aims. The universities which are not competed to the people with each other, evaluate them according to their competence and hobbies, dont orient them towards a single aim and provide them a lot of alternatives, help them to develop haelthy. People who stil dont have any idea about a lot of subjects, come to the university. First of all, people begin to know their family, society, environment and then the world. They have an idea about their parents, learn more about their environment and whati happening in the world. All these developments teach people to think.
Everything I have told above is a universitys first duty. As I said in the second paragraph, the General Education is very important. Personality should be developed. Observing the peoples relationships and understanding them, rocognizing different cultures and attitudes and perceiving them and being well-adjusted with all these differences are so important that people can understand and learn well during the university education. If a person can understand these changes, he can develop. The university develops not only peoples point of view to the world and also to the art, history and science. It teaches to understand both the past and comment on the future.
In addition, the university guide people for their responsibilities development. It teaches what a person should do or have to do so, we are together with the society by learning these responsibilities. All these concepts refer to the General Education. In fact, there is no definition of it, because its not a positive science. Its a persons attitude and it can change and also its with the real life. So it prepares a person to the life and its not the theoretical.
Nowadays, a lot of universities give people only a professional education and certain technical knowledge. From day to day, such universities are getting more and more. So they are theoretical and of little value. As I said before, one of the universitys duties is also Professional Education. It includes necessary technical knowledges related to a certain profession field, but its together with the society. So, social ethic is important, because its necessary for every profession. It teaches the people to work honestly.
After a person recognizes himself, he chooses a job he wants and develops himself about the job. The university is the home of the science and science is constantly getting developed. The university must keep in step with the developing science. Even, most developed universities create the science on their own. They prepare the people to the cahnging science and developing technology. So people become an expert in their professional life from day to day.
If a university doesnt have any necessary technology, it cant follow the constantly developing technology and it hinders the peoples professional developments. Therefore, if the university doesnt provide the machines which are used in the real life and eveyday changing and developing technology for people, it cant be useful for them. Whereas, the universities which provide the technology which is used in the real life and give all the professional knowledges for the people, are valuable, because they are practical.

The educational system in universities are especially based on theorietical knowledge and practicing these knowledges effectively students learn theoritical knowledges in schools. After first step students practice by using these knowledges sometimes they prepare some projects by using these knowledges. In this way, they have a chance for using these knowledges by combining their own sentences and expressions. But the system importance to theorietical knowledge than practicing these gives more knowledges because the exams consist of theorietical knowledge so students always study theorietical knowledges and also students give importance to these theorietical knowledges very much. But the students dont understand the importance of practicing and how to use these knowledges in real life because students only want to pass theorietical the exams and dont think the end of these studies. There are some unavailable results of giving importance to the theorietical knowledge and dont prepare the students for the real world. These are not making a relation between theorieticial knowledge and working in real life, not adopt to work and not using their talented in their jobs.
Firstly, students dont make a relation between theorietical knowledge and working in real life. Students study their lessons, do their homeworks, projects but they dont know the meaning and aim of these lessons, projects and homeworks while they are studying in university. They only do their tuties for their necessity. They dont think the practice way of these knowledges. So they have a lot of problems about combining the theorietical and practice way of knowledges. If they dont solve this problem, their theorieticial knowledges can bemeaningless and useless so their knowledges are only stared in their brains and fossilized day by day and they dont use their knowledges while they are working.
Secondly, students cant adopt their own jobs after they are graduated. The period when the student graduated and beginning to work is very important period for students. In this period they dont feel themself as a worker and also they dont feel as a student because when they are student, their training period is very short or they dont take any training period about their jobs. In intern period, students go to the working places and they practice with their teachers. They try to do what they learn and what they know about their tuties. So they can see what they dont know and what they do very well. But many students only learn theorietical knowledges and they finish their educational life without being intern. So they dont adopt their jobs and they dont feel as responsible person against his job so they can be unsuccessful and they dont like working because they are not satisfied from their duties. They can be between being students and being worker also they can feel themself in a situation as 
choosing one of them or they can decide to do nothing about their jobs.
Lastly, they dont develop their talented in their jobs. In the beginning of their university life, they chose their faculty according to their abilities and wishes but while they are studying their lessons or making their projects, they dont use their personal abilities effectively. Also they lose their creativity on their duties because of memorizing theorietical knowledges so they dont use their knowledges by adopting their abilities. They dont combine them and their knowledges about their duties become ordinary.
Consequently, the meaning of an university degree should be that students learn the knowledges for using them in real life not facilisized in their brains. So university system should give more importance to practice and the long and effective training period. Some educational systems can be developed for making trainers more adopted and willing with their own knowledges. And also students can use their abilities in their real life so they will feel more comfortable and they will be self concious. Then they will become more successful and creative in their jobs.

Turkey is grappling with a problem that confronts many developing countries:how to modernize huge centralized university systems to respond to the challeges of a fast changing new era.
There are approximately 72 universities including private universities . Students are admitted to universities through a examination held once a year. In order to obtain a good future, students want to study in good departments at good universities. This is why they start studying for the entrance exams as much as two years in advance, generally taking private courses as well. They need to get high points to have a chance. After the results students need to make their selections and the YOK place the students starting from the highest points. As there are more applications than quotas in universities, not everyone could get placed. Generally speaking 1/3 of the students could continue to the university. The others continue to the private universities if they can afford or wait more years. But , What is all process for? Students just want to be prepared for the real world. But how? Can Turkeys universities get them what they want? Unfortunately, I do not think so. 	
If you look at some universities , you can feel for the childrens future . Yes, there are some private universities who are in a good equipment. Most classes are in English, the language of many academic materials, journals and of international business. The United States is the standard for most of the Private Universities. They are trying to get best professors who will not give theratical learning by offering three or four times as much money. Devised by a team of international academics, they emphasize interaction between students and teachers. We can give Sabanc , Bilkent , Ko as examples. For instance, ambitions are high at Sabanc University, whose campus sits on a dreary hillside. It was conceived over two years in meetings with more than 50 international academics , with a goal of structing the university of the future. Equipment and classrooms are state of the art given laptops. 8000 internet connections are scattered across the campus from classrooms to grassy outdoor areas. The impact of private universities can be said small. Tuition at the private universities ranges from a few thousand dollars a year to $10. 000. So, it is not easy to have these conditions. Besides, at last, they used to choose students through interviews and a test. But shortly, they have started to accept students by entrance exam score alone. And their score limit is so low. So, the students who have this chance can enter to these universities. But, when we come to State Universities , we encounter the poorness of Turkey. Because, from the 72 universities of Turkey approximately 60 of them are State Universities. This shows the reality of educational system of Turkey. Some State Universities have also good equipments to make students prepare for the real world not just to find a good job such as Odt , Istanbul , Hacettepe , Anadolu. . As they do not have deep financial troubles , they can provide what students want for the aim of being an educated person for the world. But, Do the other 
State Universities who are placed in rural parts have this chance?      
Resources for education spread among the 53 State Universities , which depend on government money As they do not charge tuition. Also, spending per student has declined steadily, classrooms are overcrowded , new equipment is lacking , their degrees are theratical and the salaries of lectures are very low. So, maybe for this reason lecturers do not get motivated and they reflect this to the students. These universities also suffer from rigid bureaucracy. In addition , they are expanded by taking in more students. So, this resulted in an impersonal atmosphere. And the most upsetting point is that we do not know how to develop ourselves. We graduate from the universities, have degrees which are seen as much important. But, we even can not find a good job. Because our universities do not make us learn how to live against the world. We think that we know everything, how to communicate, bahave, stand by our feet. But, in reality, unfortunately we do not.
To sum up, After seeing the reality of educational system of us , we can say that university education of Turkey is theratical and do not prepare students for the real world. But, we must even try to do whatever we could to get rid of this unhopeful situation for just our new generations.

How many percent of university degrees dont face to the difficulties at first years when they begin to work in our country. This proportion may be under percent of % 50. I think that , indeed, there are many reason of this situation but the most important reason, for me, is theoretical education in the universities. Most university degrees are theoretical and do not prepare students for the real life; they are therefore not little value.
Many students are to struggle with difficulties in their business at first years life, as great part of education is theoretical. Hard conditions they face and problems require to have different solutions or alternatives depend on practise in real life. On the one hand, informations are, learnt in universities are theoretical, on the other hand, necessities have to be done in real life practical, so many students dont have knowledge of what they do and how can they do something, while they work. As a educator or since we will be a teacher, most probability, we would be a member of this group that arent sure of what they should do if not we could not improve ourselves individually in our field.
In my opinion the main reason of theoretical education is that many subjects/ information whether is not usefull or not try to be learnt in a short time. Our books are consists of many theoretical information that we wont use or we can not use so we learn that only by memory instead of knowing totally what is it.
And also we learn all not necassary subject for the exam. That we study some subject each time is sign of theoretical education, isnt it? If we will learn only usefull or necessary things are used in our life, information would be more permanent in students mind. In addition to this memorization decreases power of imagination, creativity; therefore many students cant produce solution against to the problem or they cant challenge to the difficult situation.
Another reason of theoretical education, teachers do not conform or practise what they said in the classroom. For example; teacher explain what is the meaning of democrasy. Although she or he explain concept of democrasy very well, she or he does not practise this subject in the classroom. For instance she or he does not behavior students equally while evaluating or giving permission to speak in the classroom. Thats they are not good model for students.
Another striking dimension way of this situation is job advertisement. Experienced word attract our attention. Almost employment agencies want experienced workers.It means that to be well-qualified teachers, engineers, ext. you need to work few years at the begining. We face to this fact that is paid insufficient in every part of the real life.
I dont know why we tend to this method of education may be it is more simpler than others- but I know very well that theoretical education cause to our life more difficult. Had not been theoretical education almost every university degrees bad experience would not have that cause to decreases their self-confident in their first years of business life.

First of all, I think most university degrees are to some extend theoretical. After graduating from a university, who can carry out all of his /her aims completely as he/she thinks? Nobody can be prepared to the real life conditions in most universities. They are not ready to be able to surmount the difficulties of the real life.
In most universities, students have to learn some compulsory lessons that generally depend on theoretical knowledge. These lessons have to be learned even memorized by the university students. However, what are the advantages of this kind of a learning- teaching system to the students in their future life? Theoretical knowledge allows somebody to progress to some extend if this knowledge does not combine with the practical skills. Especially, practical skills are more effective and important in providing somebody to improve himself.
The university students have little chance to be able to practice their branches effectively in most universities. The university does not provide many opportunities to the students to improve their practical skills, which are necessary for them. The students do not have practical, pragmatic lessons so they do not use their broad knowledge about a subject even if they have a great theoretical knowledge. All the theoretical knowledge is of little value unless this knowledge is put into practice. There are not enough computers for each student to benefit from them while studying in addition to their books. The number of laborites is inadequate in most of the universities. Without these how can the students put into practice their knowledge about the lesson and how can they understand the subject clear?
Generally, students do not find what they expect from life when they graduate from the university. That is, the expectations of the university students do not coincide with the life conditions. When a student becomes a teacher in the future, he does not know what he should do actually. Since he is out of practice, he cannot be successful in his work. When he is a teacher, for instance, his students depend on what he does using course-book without using practical skills.
If we handle with the situation from another aspect, we must mention about the limitations and lack of materials in the schools. As we know most of the teachers are not be able to use some materials related to the subject they explain because the schools, generally, are lack of sources, materials, computers etc. So the student becomes a teacher, he cannot benefit from what he learns theoretically in the university. For that reason, the teachers often have difficulties in teaching a subject effectively.
So far I mean to tell that education does not depend on theories. Theoretical knowledge is necessary but to some extend. Theory has no importance when it does not consist of practical skills. Especially in some occupations, such as being a teacher, practical skills are more necessary and important. You can have a great deal of knowledge about a subject, but if you are not able to explain it to somebody, whats the use of having a great deal of theoretical knowledge? If you compose your knowledge with your practical skills, you will be effective in your occupation; otherwise you will not be successful. To be able to be successful, one should put into practical what he learns but if the universities do not try to provide opportunities to the students to develop their practical skills, how these students put into practice their knowledge and reach their aims? The life requires practical skills as well as knowledge.
Unfortunately, many graduated students have the same problem: Being lack of practical. Since having a good job requires theoretical knowledge related to the job and the practical usage of this knowledge, many students graduated from the university are not able to find a suitable job for themselves. Focusing only to the theory or theoretical knowledge is not enough to be successful. It is possible for someone to develop himself by having knowledge related to his branch and using his practical skills in accordance with this. The university students have to be capable of putting into practice their knowledge with the aim of being successful or increasing their success in daily life.

Although some people think that most university degrees are theoretical and dont prepare students for the real world university degrees are the most important step for the real world. Firstly;university degrees are given in return for theoretic information. Secondly; all employer wants to see university degree. And lastly; thanks to the university degrees, people are appreciated by the other people.
University degrees are given in return for theoretic information. People are educated at the university for their career. For example; students who want to be English teacher must learn all theoretical information about their profession. They must learn phonetics, syntax, pronunciation of words, American Literature, Children Literature, short stories, novels, and they must speak fluently, write and read easily. Moreover, they must learn grammer and know how to teach it. As a result of these theoretic information, High Education Committe give university degrees. This is an important proof that students know everything about their job. And so they become a teacher and start to teach their theoretical information to their students. While teaching they learn practical information about their job. To sum up; university degrees may not prepare student for the real world but it is necessary step at the begining of the life.
All employer want to see the university degrees when they employ worker or member. Because they know that if someone has got a university degree they know all thing about their career. All university in Turkey has a wonderful educational system. The whole teachers in our university are well-educated and teach all necessary things about their subject to their children. When these students graduate from university they know all thing so they take university degrees. And in Turkey if person doesnt have university degree he or she cant find job because they dont know theoretic knowledge about their job. If people want to find job, they should have university degree. Shortly, university degree may not prepare for real world but it is necessary step for finding a good job.
Thanks to the university degrees people are appreciated by other people. One person who graduated from university and take university degree isnt the same person who greduated from only high school. For example; when an English teacher, a doctor, a lawyer or a judge go to the bank officer in the bank treat them in a good way. They solve their problem immediately. Because they have got career and university degree. On the other hand, when person who greduated from only high school or havent got university degree go to the bank the officer in the bank dont appreciate him or her. They dont solve their problem immediately because they dont have a career or universty degree. As a result of this; university degrees may not prepare for real world but it is necessary step for being honorable people.
Although university degrees are necessary step for life, finding a job, and being honorable people, some people think that university degrees are theoretical and dont prepare student for the real world. Firstly; they say that university is unnecessary and students can learn their job while they are working. Secondly; they think that university degrees arent necessary for finding a job. Lastly; they think that people shouldnt be appreciated thanks to their university degrees.
University is unnecessary and students can learn their job by working. For example;one person who want to be a English teacher should learn only general things ( phonetics, syntax or literature are unnecessary) and should be under training. Theoretic infomation is not more necessary than practical information. Besides, they think that five or six yaers are long for taking universitiy degree and some information which is taught is is redundant so university degree is formality.
University degrees arent necessary for finding a job. If people know their job they can find job and they can learn it easily without taking university degrees.One person who graduated from university may not know more information than graduate students in only high school. So the university degree cant prepare students for real world.
People shouldnt be appreciated thanks to their university degrees. Because every people have some culture and every people should appreciated by other people. All people deserve respect without having university degrees.
These two diferrent opinions may be true for two different groups of people. I support that university degrees are the most important step for the real world. In our country if someone want to learn their profession perfectly, find a job, and become a honorable person they should take university degrees.

Most university degrees are theoratical and dont prepare students for the real world. They are therefore of little value. I agree with this opinion. It is true that education in most nversities are not so good. The reason of this can be the lack of sufficient applications. They dont create enough situations for the students to practice their theoratical knowledge on their own field, so the students dont feel to be ready for working in a job and they can not see themselves as a useful person on their own field. Then university education has a little worth. However we can say that university education isnot neccessary for the students. In contrast niversity degree is very important as much as the application, but on account of many reasons, niversity degree can decrease ts important.
One reason is that education in most universities are based on ideas and principles, not on practical experience. They supply students with what they need theoratically and they dont give opportunities for the students to practice. As students dont put their theoratical knowledge in to practice, they can easily forget them in time. Then they are deprived of both the knowledge and practice, when they start to work. For example, while the students are studing their lessons, they memorize the subjects in the books. On the exam they write these informations on exam papers. When the school is finished, these informations in their heads gets lost in time, because they don t use them memorize them. Therefore universities have a little value.
Another reason that causes me to think in this way is that although some universities provide students some situations to practice these are not enough for them. So students feel not ready for working. For example students who are in educational faculty go to training in some schools in their second and last years to practice their theoritical knowledge. In their second year they go to training one time in a week. The only thing they do is to observe teachers students, school and the relationship of them. They are passive. In their last year, they undergo training two times in a week. In this time they start to teach. However the periods of their training time in both their second and last years are very short and not enough for them. In a short time how do they observe students, teachers so on. ? Of course t is impossible for them. Then they can not learn anything productively.
Also, teachers try to create some situations for students, however these can not be useful for students, because these situations provided by teachers can not include in real situations. For example someone who is in english department take the lesson teach english. In this lesson he pretends that he is a teacher and he sees his friends as a elemantary school students. He teaches something to them. While teaching, he doesnt have any problem about anything. However in a real situation, he can face of lots of problemetics events. Maybe some of his students can not easilt understand or the class is not suitable for them or students are so spoiled Therefore we can say that universities dont prepare students for a real world.
Another rason that causes university degrees to losttheir importance is unneccessary lessons. In most universities students have to studysome lessons they dont need in their future life. These lessons givev in universities dont have an obvious aim directed towords students. They dont probably use these principles and ideas in their profession. For example someone who is in english department takes culture lesson. In this lesson he learns British and Americanculture history,govermental system,medical and health systems Hover he doesnt use these iinformations, when he is a teacher in his future life.
The last reason I can say is teachers and students. Some students dont give important enough to their lessons. They study their lessons in order to pass thei class. They dont study to learn. Then they easily forget all things they study after finishing the schools. Some teachers dont provide them a nice atmosphere. They only teach theoratical informations monotonously and dont create them real situations to practice. Therefore both teachers and students dont find pleasure in lessons. Students can not understand anything and teachers can not be productive. Then this decreases the value of some universities degrees.
To sum up, as you see there are many reasons that reduce universitiy degrees important and make students to feel not ready for the real world. In order to decrease these reasons both students and teachers must give equal important to both theoratical knowledge and application. Also universities support students to do that.

Every government wants their children to grow according to their politics. Thats why they prepare their education program caring about their ideas. This can be acceptable for me. However almost every government neglects the practice part of the education. This concludes a real disaster both for the students and for the government.
Primary school is the place of finding our childrens skillsand direct them by the hepl of their interests. This means that we should find their secret skills and help them to recognize them. By doing so, we encourage those fresh minds for their future. This help can be done by practising everything as much as possible. On the other side in primary schools, we fill our childrens mind full of knowledge which they can never make the chance of touching or living. For example in the lesson of science we teach lots of formules to our children instead of practising them in the lab. Even when we make experiment in the lab, only the teacher does everything, the children look at what he/she is doing. Consequently, this knowledge can not be practised by any of the students.
This theory-based education goes on after primary school. In high school, we see our childrens eyes ull of information, they know everything but can not do anything. They are like machines which are programmed only for the university exam. After graduation they have just one choice for their future; university degree, but what about their value of university degree?
Then in technical schools, students have nothing to do in this theory based education. They learn everything in their field but they do not practise what they learnt. Maybe they learn the definition of machine and types of machine but they can not repair a machine. Because they do not have a homework or an exam related with the repair of a machine.
When the come to the university, nothing changes. Theoretical education is faced with them again. They focus on knowledge but not practise. We see lots of engineeers who can not hold even a screwdriver.
In daily life, everything is so different from the given theoretical education, our students get from university. For instance, a man whose car is broken wants only o se this car again a repairman does not interest in machine types but repair it quickly and economically, but what about or students association with the real life after the graduation from university? They are shocked. They find themselves in a vey different world from university. They recognize that their university degree have little value. Because they can not use what they know, they feel themselves insufficient. They can not find a job. f they have a chance to find a job, they have a lot of difficulty. How can a civil engineer, who does not have much experience of building, have the chance of making money? 
Our teachers learn how to teach their subjects to the children from their professors. However, when they are in front of those children they have so much difficulty teaching them what they know. Because their one year practice is not enough to use everything to teach.
Finally, in schools theoretical education is being given to our students i a persistant way. They do not hae the chance to recognize that all of their dense education about 15-years have little value until they find themselves in real life. In my opinion, we shold not accuse anyone or our students for being uncreative anf insufficient members of the community. This is an absolute guilt of theoretical education. Until something changes, the generation of theory will continue to suffer from it.

University degrees are theoretical and do not prepare students for the real life is a common lament of students which exactly represents human beings desire to find everything has been prepared by someone else for them to take the pleasure of.When it comes to the argument on the value of the university degrees ,to make the value judgement we should make clear the answers of the following questions: What is it we name real life? What is main task of university education? And as the last question, what is the task of the student during the university education?
The term which we referred to as real life defines a complex structure within which a person may get into contact with different people with differing expectations and point of views. This variation in exectations and point of views causes various problems to come to the surface. Then if we want to find a solution to the above complaint about the universities inadequacy we need a university which gives the students a list of the possible human expectations and point of views. Furthermar, it should also be included in the list that which expectation and point of view brings about what sort of problem. Still, it is not enough. The solutions to verying problems should also be listed with a simple easily comprehensible style. That is not it! Such a thing can not even be called as utopia. Then what should be the contribution of university education to a student?
The surface responsibility of an university schedule is to supply the students with the theoretical knowledge of their department. This is the most visible but the least important task of a university education. The others, making the students gain critical thinking and problem solving abilities are the least visible but the most vital mission of university education. Students should be expased to as many different point of views about as many subjects as possible. Other than imposing certain truths the system should let the students to realize and criticise different views and construct their own point of views. The tendency of accepting all the things written on a piece of paper as changing truths should be demolished. If a person gains the ability of critical thinking then she becomes able to see the gaps not only in the point of views at other people but also in her own way of looking at life. Realizing the gaps and criticising meself brings together the change and development. A person who can develope oneself becomes a fully functraining person for the society and it beers at the same time personal satisfaction and happiness.
Additionaly, education in a university should not be taken as exposing students to a mass of knowledge to memorize. Students should not be lacked at the affective domain, they should be given the chance to apply what they be expanted to cognitive domain. This brings together the maturation of education process the role of the students also very big.
The first responsibility of a student is to determine the exact purpose of her university education. She should be able to apply her knowledge into her life and should be open to new ideas and should work really hard. She should also understand that nothing beautiful comes as ready in a big ornamented package in the real life. If one wants something she should give time and enough effort.
As a conclusion, the thing which we call real life is something really difficult to cape with to learn how to come over it no university programe, even the best one, is efficient enough on its own. The cooperation of the education system with students results in qualifed and skilfull students to graduate from university departments and any problem that they will come face to face in reality seems them as impossible to be solved because they would be skilfull enough to find alternative solutions to problems even the ones that seems to be impossible to come over, then the university degree becomes the most valuable thing to passess on the earth.

We live in the age of information now and everything depends on information. It directly effects our not only business life but also social life, even our private life. It is everywhere. Each person for some time in her/his period of living has education to adapt to the requirements of the epoch. Elementary school is for reading and writing, primary school is for general knowledge, high school is for preparation for collage, and lastly university is for both getting a profession and being intellectual. Most of us pass these steps. To get a good and respectful job people go to universities. In a situation like, it is nonsense to think that most university degrees are theoretical and do not prepare students for real world. They are therefore, off very little value.
First of all, in universities you have the education of what you want to be in the future, because people choose which department they want to be taught through their preferences. When they attend classes they begin to have lessons of their department, and this forms the theoretical part of their education. This part goes on when the students are thought to be sufficient enough to be proficient. In other words, in some departments they have chance to serve internship, which forms preparation for the profession such as in education department, biology department, medical science, and so on. With this way students have the chance to practice on their study with the help of their teachers, with real documents, sometimes in real places. Although many people think just the opposite the education in university does not remain in theory. Students have opportunity to apply theory to practice.
Secondly, theory jams the main component of the knowledge of peoples occupation. They can not be able to run their job without knowing nothing about it. To be successful students get the idea of what they are dealing with. So throughout the lessons students learn the theoretical side and get the general, basic information of the issue. At the same time people see details, probable problems they may enccounter and solutions about the profession with their lecturers. Thus, it is not possible to practice without having theory of anything.
Lastly, no one can be a professor or lecturer or an engineer with less or no education. When we look around us we notice that the academicians, lecturers are educated in universities. So has can they become these positions. If universities do not prepare people to real world and they are off very little value. How can those people manage to do this? The experience we get through our lives can not make us neither professor nor teacher. The only thing that we have by attending in the daily life is practicing. But not having the knowledge of for instance being architect or teaching a person something. It is just like eating the cream, but leaving the cake of a tiramisu.
As a consequence, some of us may think that what students learn in universities remains in theory and are mostly not used in the rest of their life. That might be true to some extent, however it should not be ignored that having no theoretical education what you do is useless and becomes bubbles of a soap.

There are always arguments about universities in this country. The main problem is about their being theoretical and not preparing the students to the real world. In fact, universities should not be counted as something which have very little value because they are theoretical and do not prepare students to the real world. On the other hand, there exist many reasons for this.
One of the reason is economic unsteadiness of this country. If the economy of Turkey was steady and in good level, expenses paid for the university would return to the universities again, instead they cover up the governments fraud. If the expenses returned to the universities, there would be much more laboratories, which allow students to make practices, and universities could provide students tours on factories, working areas to the schools, etc.
Second reason is the lack of working areas and productivity in Turkey. A university gives everything about a job and makes a student know everything about his branch, and also prepares a good worker. After finishing university with this good abilities, the man or the woman only needs a place, an area to perform his/her job. So, what if there is no places, no factories, no schools, no areas in which he/she will perform their knowledges, in this country? If there is no place that is suitable for their knowledge, they will have to work in other jobs, such as being taxi driver, or they will migrate to the other countries, if they haev passibilities, So a university has nothing to the with performances of students after graduating.
In universities, there are some training periods that students should undergo. These periods are very important not only for showing the student himself, but also for preparing the students to the real world. These training periods provides enough medium for students to perform their knowledge. Third reason is students acting as they undergo training. Although all these training periods are very important for them, some of the students do not really undergo these trainings, but prepare fake dokuments including they did undergo training period. So they can not be successfull in the real working life after graduating. There is nothing a university can do if the students are faker.
As a conclusion, the reasons given above are only a few of the whole. So as you see, universities really tries to prepare students to the real life but some obstacles prevent this. The economy of the country may be unsteady, but at least the expenses of the students should be spend for the students, not for the other things, in order to overcome these obstacles. And also, new factories, working areas should be built, so the students can act without arguing such problems. And especially, students should be aware of the importance of training periods and should stop behaving as a faker.
One should consider all these facts before criticisizing the university system in Turkey. We ought to accept that the universities could be in better conditions, but if we overcomed the obstacles, that we talked above.

The process of education has an important role in a persones life. This process consists of different periods and the last stages of this process is the university education. University degree with its own features is different from the previous ones. University is the turning point for many young people. It is a diognastic role for the students while passing the business or real life. But today university degree does not propare students for the future. Also the necessary conditions are not provided for solving this problem. To provide those conditions it should be made basic changes in the system of university degree. What are those changes?
Firstly, the structure of the university degree should be different from the primary and high education. The education given at university should not be a general summary of the priorty words, the repetiton of the information which students have already known does not gash anything to them. Because of this university should give more importance to practice than the theary. While theoretical information is temporary, the applied information is permonent. To pass applied education is not difficult. The first duty which should be done is to decrease the number of the theoretical lessons. In the university instead of these lessons, productive and entertaining lessons should be choosen. This type of lessons do not bother the students and they increase the interests of the students. Also the memorization is the most important part of theoretical education. But this system should be changed and the students should not be forced to memorize the everything. Because the information which is obtained by memorizing is 
forgotten in a short time. As education is a serious process it should be given too much importance as most of time is spent for it. So, knowledge should not only be given theoretically, It should not be forgotten that no matter has much you read, study or memorize, you can not be successful when you come across with the application of what you do if you have never tried it. For this reason, universities should enable students for practicing what they learn.
Secondly, the most important deficiency of the theoretical education is that it does not prepare people for real problems. For example, the history of the English or the structure of this language is teached theoretically to the students who study in English department. But it is not teached them how they can use or how they can teach this information the primary schools students. In addition to this speaking lessons and native lecturers are very important to develop the speech ability. But there is fact that most of the English departments students do not have any speak speaker or lecturer in their university and they do not enough speaking lessons. Many problems like these are seen in every department and university. The main reason of those problems is deficiency of the lecturer or possibilities. These problems should be solved and it should be given more importance to these subjects.
To sum up, to have successful and educated young people the university degree should prepare students for the real life.

The world is constantly changing everyday. Different discoveries, ideas and solutions are being produced in all kinds of fields. Creating new things and developing rapidly have become the most important part of the modern world. When we compare the past and the present time, we can easily see the differences. Today, everything is in an order. Every society has formed systems according to needs, desires or, shorly, the characteristics of their people. These systems have been arranged in different kinds of fields such as transportation, health or education. Some of these areas are much more important than the others. They cause worldwide concern.
One of these significant and argumentative fields is education. People from all over the world consider important of education because they know from their experiences that education is the irresistible part of the development. Because of its being one of the most argumentative subjects, there are so many different types of ideas about it. Thus, education systems are various and each of them supports basic principles. One polemical view about education is that most university degrees are theoretical and do not prepare students for the real world, therefore, they have very little valve. When we consider the seal of the world to develop, the accusation is troublesome. Most university degrees ought to be theoretical because it is the way which is the key to success.
Firstly, terminology and the knowledge of that terminology play a fundamental role in being educated in a specific field. Terminology determines the borders of the branches. It forms the basis of understanding the main features of a specific branch. Learning and understanding the following stages depend on it. It is impossible to improve yourself without a sufficient grounding. Moreover, it is unachievable having the chance of practising without the terminology knowledge. For example, a lawyer should study and learn all of the terminology about the jurisprudence.
The terminology of the jurisprudence is formed by laws. A lawyer who does not know the laws related to any subject, can support our rights or what can he do in a court?
Secondly, it is possible to see everything in theory. Everything that happened and that likely to happen in the future is shown theoretically. Examples, events and the high probabilities that will be faced are given. So, while students are studying these, they have the opportunity of the any kinds of discussions. They can create their own possibilities and, also, they can find the right or wrong on their owns. If a solution can not be found, the lecturer gives students some directions or instructions how to reach a conclusion. So, by the help of the studies, students are able to improve their imagination.
Thirdly, everything which is theoretical have great valve. It is like that because theoretical knowledge gives the truths. During the formation of the systems, they are based on the theoretical knowledge. Again, the systems being functional depends on the theoretical knowledge which is based on.
On the other hand, it is wrong to say that practice is not important or it is meaningless. It has importance but not as much as theoretical knowledge has. Some people may think that it is impossible to learn without practising. It is little true because, sometimes, practice is a part of learning. However, it is rarely valid. For instance, as I mentioned before, theoretical knowledge is the basis of systems. In some situations, systems do not run perfectly. But, it is not like that because of the deficiency or blunder of theoretical knowledge. It is caused by the distorted practising. For example, public management is different in theory and also very different in practice in our country. In a situation like that how can we give much more importance to the practice? There is something wrong in the system and practising. Students should be educated by the directions of theioretical knowledge which are great valve. Thus, the corrupt systems are managed to be built again.
Finally, we can say that most university degrees theoretical because the knowledge is very important. Being educated by this knowledge is painful and, thus, it takes time. So, students get the knowledge which is the domain of their specific fields during their university education. It should be like that because life is full of practising.

As we can understand from the name of the university which comes from the root of universe universities are places in which universal or in other words main knowledge are taught. We learn many things at universities that we need throughout our lives in addition to the theoretical knowledge about our departments. However, these universal places can not give us everything. There are three basic, traditional functional universities; giving theoretical knowledge about our jobs in the future, providing to grasp our mental and creative skills and teaching us to prepare ourselves to life.
First of all, as it is known all universities main function is giving theoretical knowledge about our jobs that we are going to do in the future. In my opinion being theoretical means giving the needed knowledge about a specific department and allowing pupils to apply the learned information when we come to the question about universities valves on are hand it is true that some university degrees are of very little valve but it is not because their being too theoretical on the contrary it is because their not being able to give theoretical knowledge. But on the other hand the number of such degrees are limited so most university so most university degrees are theoretical which is a must to be a university.
Secondly, all universities in the world  so in our country  provide us to group our mental and creative skills. We can look this in two perspectives. One of them is again theoretical perspective, the other one is social perspective. There is learning research skills on the care of the theoretical perspective of the mental and creative skills. One of the most significant ability that are developed in universities is research skill. At first hand we are taught how to make an investigation on a specific topic. Then we find a topic and make our researches in the may that are taught to us. And then at the last year of our university education life we prepare a thesis which means that me make a very detailed investigation. Most universities follow this order about making research while teaching their theoretical field knowledge. If you take making investigation seriously during your university education life, it becomes a lifestyle to you. You apply your ability on making research to all parts in your life 
which makes you a real researcher. And think that is the most important thing and makes people become successful throughout their lives. Also universities social sides provide us to group our mental and creative skills. Most universities submit many social activities on a vest scale. And you participate one or more than one of them actively according to your ability which makes you socially group your mental and creative skills.
The third aim of universities is to teach students to prepare themselves to life. It is true that most universities do not prepare students for the real world because that is impossible. However, universities teach pupils to prepare themselves to their lives. This highest education schools enable us to live long enough to know our responsibilities as a person. A person himself learns what life means and prepare himself the difficulties that he will be confronted with. Universities, friends in fact even families can not prepare us to the real world. As I said before they only teach how to do it. So I dont think that most universities are of very little valve. Real world can only be learned by experience and universities teach us to stay on our feet and trust ourselves by our knowledge and skills.
In conclusion I can say that we cannot limit education of real world with universities. As the American pedagogist John Dewey said, Education is something which is learned by experience and education of real world is everywhere.

The university should be the institution in which universal facts are searched, real information and free thought are dominant and also practical knowledge become a matter of front-rank importance as well as theoretical knowledge; but nowadays most university degrees are theoretical and do not prepare students for the real world. They are therefore of very little values. Reasons of this can be listed as; university exam that ignores interests and abilities of students, universities not having sufficient and necessary opportunities for education, and theoretical lessons being more then applied lessons.
The first reason is that university exam ignores interests and abilities of students. In order to explain this better, it is important to go back to primary, secondary and high schools. Students are forced to learn by memorization, even when they are at primary school. Their creativity are prevented. For example; when they learn a foreign language, they do not get the meaning, they just memorize the form. Therefore; they can not apply the forms to the situations. They have the difficulty of expressing themselves. When they come to high school, they have to choose a department and after finishing high school they have a university exam which also depends on memorization. When the students who pass the exam come to the university, their abilities of analysis, synthesis and critical thinking are weak.
The second reason is most of the universities not having sufficient and necessary opportunities for education. The simplest example is laboratory. Students go to the laboratory but they can not work with the equipments individually; because the equipments are not enough. This means that they can not adopt theoretical knowledge to application. Let me give another example; think about an English department which does not have a native lecturer, and a language laboratory. At least when they are prep class they need a native lecturer to learn the correct pronunciation, vocabulary and cultural characteristics of English. They need a language laboratory for their listening lessons at least be effective. In fact laboratories are not just the problems of English or science departments. In all faculties they are big problems.
Lastly, theoretical lessons are more than applied lessons in most of the universities. In fact this is a bit related to opportunities. If there is not a laboratory in an faculty of engineering for example, how the students will be able to have applied lessons. They will just memorize the theoretical information as always. Another view is that students do not get very much about computers and English. They have these lessons but they only get the basic things and this is not enough. So these conditions force them to learn English and computer from private courses. When the students graduate from university, they search for jobs related to their branches, but most of them can not find. Those who find jobs get shocked when they begin to work; because, they see that what they have learnt in the university is very different from what they have to do. For instance a student from education faculty graduates and goes to the school in which S/he will teach. Unfortunately s/he can not apply what s/he has learnt to the circumstances, because of the lack of applied lessons and education system. Turning back to the main point, when the lessons generally depend on theory, universities can not grow up qualified individuals.
As a conclusion, since most university degrees are theoretical and do not prepare students for the real world, and so they are of very little values. Reasons of this are variable beginning from primary school to graduation and also they are related to the opportunities.

If someone asks me the happiest day in my life, I think my answer will be the day when I started Anatolian High School , I learned the first English word that day. I like English very much and even those days I was thinking university exam and thought that everything is OK. However I suddenly understood that attending a university is only a starting point. The thing you need in the real world is different from what you learned in the university. Ill give my own experience as on example while telling why I write my own education. Anyway, I felt worse as the days were passing, since I understood that university is different from the place that I imagine before I admit that my choice was wrong because there was another department for training English teachers. However I was only seventeen years old when I made that choice. The interesting point is that, although we are attending the faculty at science, most of us have to be English teacher. Because we dont have any other chance. This is a fact of our 
country. The point that I want to reach is the fact that the schematas in the universities are mostly not according to the needs in the real world. We may learn very hard and interesting knowledge about English, however most of us dont know how to behave, teach, etc in a primary school. Because we arent trained as teachers. Im not sure that the things that we learn in the university will be very helpful in our working life. I believe that this situation is some in most departments of the university. I have a lot of friends from other departments and we share the some problem. The teachers in the universities may be doing their job in the best way however we mustnt forget that only a few of the students can stay and work in the universities after graduating. The others have to work, too and they need extra education far their new jobs. I believe that the lessons must be according to the needs of the country rather than the schemata. The problem can be solved by preparing the schematas according to the real world needs. There may be both theoretical and practical lessons which prepare the students for working life. For example; while having lessons such as morphology, syntax, semantics, phonology, etc we may have practical lessons such us going to other schools for watching the teachers while giving lessons to the primary or high school students. This must go on in every year of the university life. People need English teachers more than philologs. Again, I have to say that, our teachers do their jobs in the best way. However they have to give lessons according to schematas. The problem is in the system. And the best way of solving the problem is reordering this system. We dont need only philologs but we also need writers, translators, teachers, and so on.

Today more and more people from young generation are struggling in a competition in order to win the university entrance exam. Since it is their most challenging and desirable target to become a university student. When they reach their goal and begin to attend it, they see that being there is not the end of the competition. Exams continue till the graduation, till the most basic aim-getting the degree. Although youth expect a great many things such as a good future, a good life and a good career from their degree, most of the time a degree means nothing. Due to the fact that taking a degree does not mean anyone is ready for the real difficult life which gives so many responsibilities or anyone has developed appropriate character to start the new life or anyone is qualified enough to get, deserve a job in my opinion there are a few main reasons that result in these realities I have mentioned above. Firstly, most of the university students study only for passing the exams. Secondly, generally except from private universities, universities are lack of many facilities. Lastly, students do not make any effort to improve their knowledge, skills or any hobbies to add something new into their personality. These are the basic causes I will mention about which decrease the value of the degrees according to me.
To begin with we can talk about the students studying habits. Mostly their only aim is to pass the exams. Therefore, there is no regular studying style, on the contrary, there is last night studying till the morning. What can be expected from such a studying? Because of this type of studying everything is being memorised which can be forgotten in a short time or even during the examinations namely, the knowledge of studied field is useless and futile. Students do not contribute information about their field so much to themselves.
Next, qualities are not qualified enough for the students to have an opportunity to improve themselves. Even some universities are made up of only one, two or three buildings, nothing more. Yet a good university should have a large campus which consist of illuminated libraries, laboratories, searching centers with computers and leisure centers that enable students to develop themselves. There should not be time for them to stand lazily. In contrast time should be worthy and the students should evaluate their time with beneficial interests.
Finally, students are effortless. They do not struggle with difficulties. Even though universities arent well qualified individuals especially young individuals can achieve everything with their ambitions. Only if they can add new knowledge to their existing knowledge by making much research, new skills to their existing skills, new hobbies to existing hobbies they are well educated. All I count require curiosity. University students should be curious about all new things, but not about unnecessary things.
As a conclusion, if a graduate wants his/her degree to carry importance or real valve, he/she should have made so many efforts to deserve it. Otherwise it cannot be something other than a blank sheet.

In the world of today, especially in Turkey. Universities which are considered as wonderlands are the dream of all youngs. They try hard and hard in order to study at a university and get a university degree. But after at least a four years education period do students are prepared for the real world? Of course not! How many students can be successful in the real world or how many of them use what they get from dreamlands in the real world? Of course none!!! But why? Because most university degrees are theoretical and do not prepare students for the real world. Therefore of very little valve.
Many problems that many university students face to face, show that the degrees that they get from universities dont help them in the real world. Their first disappointment and the main problem of individuals after graduation is to find a job. Changing and developing worlds bosses do not pay attention to degrees, the most important criterias for them today is individuals to use knowledge practically, to have self confidence, to have a point of view. Shortly they seek for equipped people. But because of the theoretical knowledge the individuals get from universities, they fail to find and get a job. Because and theoretical knowledge can not improve peoples personality, point of view and do not give chance them to use their knowledge practically. This shows clearly that people are not improved in universities or in other words the ways that improve peoples personality, point of view and ability of practical usage of knowledge are not shown in universities. They are only donated with theoretical knowledge.
Therefore, of course, there are opposite ideas on this claim. Some people think that a university degree opens all doors of real world. But can a theoretically equipped individual open the doors of real world? Of course, he knows how to open the doors theoretically but he can not use the keys. There are a lot of people who can not work on their own profession even a high university degrees. You can see an engineer as a grocer. Again oppositions claim that their working as a grocer not as an engineer is not the fault of university degrees but individuals in the aspect of their inability of using their degrees and knowledge in order to reach a profession of their own. But as mentioned before if universities do not show the ways of using the students theirselves and do not show the place of keys that open the doors how can they success to live, to work and to be successful in the real world? Opposite ideas have to find the answer of this question firstly.
Finally it is certain that most university degrees are theoretical and can not help students in the real world. But this must not be seen as a claim but as a certainty. And changes and development are immediately done. Because theoretical knowledge or rules can not improve people also can not improve the societies.

TSKC1292,3.0,2.5,,,,,The prison system is outdated. No civilized society should punish its criminals: it should rehabilitate them,"
I don't agree with the above topic because criminals do what ever they do intentionaly now why should they be taken to rehabilitation; some people have to endure the pain that they cause so they have to suffer also so that they learn what they did was wrong.
Like in our community if you go to the Kimberley General Hospital on weekends you will see that there are too much cases of assult; too much stabbing and not forgetting rape; so how can we forgive an forget so easily; when you commit a crime you have two choices eather you do that or you don't do it; they are some criminal who will say I did not have a choice I was hungry or I needed the money there is not such a thing; there are people whom don't work or are not employed but they make means of making money. God have given everyone a brain so you can think for yourself what you can do best and set your through and energy on that so that you can achieve that goal.
For example in the morning news a man have chop her mother and niece with an axe it was brutally now we the community have to let it go and take that man to rehab; that man is not sick what if that man goes free again because he was not sick he knew what he was doing and goes on to have more innocent lives on the list; these criminals have to face the consequences and go to jail not rehabilitation.
Criminals have to go to jail and when they are there they have to face hardship so that when they came out of jail they should have repend and know that they are previous live was a sin; most criminals came out repend so they can make right for the wrong doings they did; In some case criminals don't think what they did was wrong so they go on doing crime now for those criminals they do things intentionally and are proud of it.
Like last year the Goverment let all the under age criminals out of jail saying the jails are full which was wrong because those criminal are back to the street again and are doing what they did but only this time they are doing more crime than before; they are saying that they are now man enought; the Goverment should have build more jail these is a serious problem the Goverment is using money for other things which we the community don't benefit from it they should use money for important things.
Now what if the rehabilitation also get full where are they going to take those criminals set them free again no it's wrong very wrong; Let them go to jail and face what they did.

I personally do not agree with this topic, because it make alittle sense to me. I personally feel that it is unfair to rehabilitate a murderer, I feel that if you are capable of taking one person's life why should your's be spared and be rehabilitated, if you are able to take one person's life, how difficult would it be for you to take as many lifes as possible.
To me rehabilitations do not work, for instance take someone who abuses alchol and that person goes to ""AA"" meetings, it will probaly help that person for a certain period, but if he or she is not wiling to give up on that thing than no one can do anything about that, and there is a saying that goes like this ""you can take a horse to the water but you can't force that horse to drink water, if it does not feel like drinking water.
Take for example a serial killer, who killing is in his blood, who feels like, he can not go through a day without killing, and you will take that person and try to rehabilitate him, how are you going to be succesful, because it is ovease that, that person will follow your moves and and try to kill you that is like putting you life in danger.
I personaly, belief that a ""Rapist"" a ""killer"" a ""bankrobber"" they will stay what they are no matter how hard you will try to change them, it is up to them to decide whether they want to change or not.
In our society today people blame things which can be easily solved, for their crime doings, there are many young people who blames the goverment, because they say the goverment does not provide them with jobs, but if you are prepared to look at things from different angles you will see that the goverment is doing more than enough to create more opportunities for young people.
You can not expert to do a certain job without having expirience, or if you are not educated for that job, and what do they do, they go to the bank and rob it, and tommorow when they are in jail they blame the government.
I also think that when a young person is caught he must not go to prison, but go to a juvinille centre because in jail older criminals learns these people new tricks and they give them, some new ideas on how to do other criminal activities.
I belive that a person who, do a thing intentionally and expect some people to live in pain for the wrongs that he did wsith intentions, should also suffer a great deal just as those person whom he did hurt suffered.
I personally feel, if you are going to hurt, me or my family member's you should be able to stand for the replucations of your doings, and not for rehabilitation because it won't work for me.

The rate of HIV/AIDS is increasing in big numbers every year. I think that the cause of this is poverty. Many people in Africa are suffering because of the high rate of unemployment, and many think that to solve this problem is to be prostitutes and don't even border to make sure that the people they sleep with use protection like condoms are ask if they have the HIV/AIDS virus. The other thing is, even if they ask them, most of them will not be faithful to them by telling them that they are HIV positive, all that they will think about is to get money from these men to support or maintain their families, and these men will not even care for these woman's health, and they will only think about the money that they pay to these women. The other thing that causes HIV/AIDS is older man use money to sleep with younger children and the children sometimes are not aware of the dangers of doing this, because they think it is fun to drive in posh cars and have beautiful clothes and jewellery that they get from older men, and that their parents cannot afford to give them.
I think because most parents are unemployed, but they wish they could give their children a good education, and a good life style parents should start to be open to their children about sex and HIV/AIDS. They should teach their children to be happy with whatever they give them to eat and to wear. To decrease the rate of HIV/AIDS the government must make sure that they create lots of jobs and stop this distribution of free condoms, because I think this is also the cause of HIV/AIDS especially in young people. Others rape because they think that it will help them forget about their poverty and just do crime. As we know that are many kinds of crime commited in South Africa, and this causes innocent people to die. Young people do not follow the ABC thing that is please just follow the A and B with this I mean abstain and be faithful to your partner do not condomise because condoms are not 100% save, and they are also not meant for children. Let us go to school whether you are rich of poor so that we get a good education, and be able to teach others about HIV/AIDS.

James was his name, he started to have lots of friend much oler than him. first he came home late at night, started to shout at me because I would tell him that he has a bad breath. That was the beginning of his aggrasion all because of smoking dagga ""ganja"" he would call it, it doesn't matter how he caled it, it was not good for him. One day James the man came home, told my mother that he wants to leave school, my mother was shocked to hear what he has just said, she couldn't believe it. My son! she said because he was the spoilt bread always gets what he wants. What are you goint to do? she asked, look for a job he answered. No my son I give you anything you want, isn't it enough? mother asked. I need money James said, how much? she asked, lots of it. Here my child she gave him R1000.00 so I heard, he said it's not enough I need more that's what he always said because he is a spoilt bread, at first I did not understand why my parents got divorced. I learnt to understand when I was a little lder, it was because my mother an educated person was ignorant and unfair, she loved James more than her other children even more than her husband. My brother used the R1000-00 to buy drugs, got addicted and started his new career, stealing until he got arrested. James the man was not man enough to take the result of his own actions, suddenly he wanted to be a child mommy's sweet little boy. Mommy was there when he was a good child but, now he is daddy's naughty boy, took after his father. She could not handle the embarrasement and bad publicity. James was sentenced to 15 years inprisonment, while in prison he was gangraped, assaulted and abused both emotionally and physically. Mommy got married to another mand and forgot about James.
When James came out of Prison he was a grown man, who had to learn it the hard way only because he was ""Thomas"" (from the Bible) seeing is believing. He had to start all over again, attended evening classes to finish his matric. He then registered with Unisa to study prison ministry, this was only possible because our father had to support his son, mother was not prepared to do it because she was disappointed. James would always tell us about his days in Prison, he says it is not a good place to be and crime does not pay.

Most of us have had the disapointment of going to a store to buy an advertised special, only to find that it was not available. This is a very frustrating situation especially if the advertised good was a basic necessity..... even though it was not budgeted for. Given these circumstances, what would be your reaction if someone came to your doorstep just to sell you the recently- advertised product at the lowest price ever?
Of course! you would buy it without hesitation. The next minute you would be calling that a bargain, and you might even invite this person to come at any time however he has ""specials"" in store for you. This is all good for you because you pay less, but have you considered where these products could be coming fom? They could have been stolen, robbed or got hold of through other illegal means. What does that make you? An accessory to a committed crime. According to the law, i.e section 36 of Act 62 of 1955 you could be charged with possession of suspected stolen goods and if found guilty, your sentence could depend on the value of the goods found in your possession.
Crime is any act punishable by law and ignorance of the law is no excuse. However small the crime you commit, you will be held liable. It doesn't matter when did you commit the crime, but once you're caught, the law will take its full course ... you will be punished.
The most rampant crime is theft hence my focus thereupon. Theft doesn't just affect an individual - it affect us all. Supermarkets and clothing stores simply elevate the prices of their goods when they notice a shortage of stock. Others simply relocate or close down and consequently we - the consumers - end up suffering.
Despite all these acts, there is hope for us all. If only we can learn to say ""no"" to ""backdoor"" transactions however tempting the offer. If only we can learn to buy from legal stores however high the cost. If only we can collaborate with the police in getting them to arrest the criminals in our community because we do know them - only then can we become a proud nation who can truly enjoy the fruits of our labour ... the democracy we have fought for so hard. And lastly if only we can teach the younger generation that, crime doesn't pay ... crime-stop-does.

When looking at the prison today, we can see that people are being treated as animals. Although they have commited crimes they have to be shown the light and not be led into the deepest dark. Most of them came into prison without seeing what they have done wrong because they have done that for a long time and got away with it. The only motto ringing in their heads is ""to make an arrow sharper, you should sharpen it more"". That is what is programmed in their minds, we can agree that, that is not an easy task to take that out but is possible. The time they spend in prison, practicing good things can lead to a new mindset.
The society has got an influence on the system which is being run by the government. This is a democratic county and the people have rights. The first question to be asked to the community is what they want out of criminals and why should they be sent to prison. When answering these questions we find that what is being practiced is only the opposite. Criminals go in and out of prison not knowing what is the lesson behind that. What we hear from the society is that they will have to be punished, to pay for their crimes, that is if they are caught. To make good out of someone you should show him the right way by thinking good ways of doing things. A person's lifeview can be changed by the enviroment she/he lives in. When into a prison you will use the same practices to get your way through a lot of things.
In life, the enviroment that you live in shows the person you are inside. If the government changes the prison from being hostel to a hotel the people will be relaxed and not find out the reason to be outside while you can get anything inside without working for it. Criminals should get positive punishment. They can serve the society while in prison, showing young people the right way by giving advices and sharing the experience of prison life. This is to be done in prison, through the media. Using their talents in a positive way and should also receive education through corresponding colleges, for them to have a start when coming out of prison.
Rehabilitation is the way of returning someone to a good state or way of life. In this situation prisoners will be taught good ways through positive punishment. They will be assisted to come up and shown an honest way of doing things. Before learning from their mistakes, they will have to see and accept that what they did was wrong. That is a good start because from there onwards, everybody will work not as a way of punishment but as a way of doing right.

Criminals, some of them have problems, their behaviour, they need to go to therapy so that the Psychologist should evaluate them and see if they are harmless to the society, some it will be difficult to evaluate them because some are so hard or will not feel free to talk about their problem that they are having for instance when a serial killer won't let a Psychologist to help him/her to find out the problem like moses sithole I'm very sorry if I appointed I think for me, he has a problem there is something that won't come out. he need to go to counselling again or maybe he was born it but don't agree. in some cases you'll find if the person maybe a girl or a boy was being molested by one of his/her parent maybe that anger or she/he lived with anger untill he/she let out that anger to someone else. and also the recent serial killer who has not being cought yet I think he has a problem and the government should catch him before is too late because he will hurt many societies.
The criminal should to rehabiliation first, be evaluated and then we could see were the problem lies so that we, the society can take further steps meaning that take decision about his/her life. Life is not always smooth like e.g in South Africa there is not work and the are other society which are still Lazy who does'nt want to help themselves and other have given up hope about their life in general and people see the solution of being criminals so that they can survive, see what I said there is a problem in criminals, some do drugs just let the pain go away while they are still toxicated many think about or start look back, the pain that they have and developed an anger and go and look or search for an object to hurt it and after he/she will be better afterwards and when he/she sober starts to regret and that anger will be with him/her for the rest of his/her life, is when rehabilitation comes so that he/she can talk able to express his/her feelings inorder to find a solution.
I think criminals are also the victim of their circumstances their also human beings just like us, no one is perfect and will never be. the society should think about criminal's feelings they should there to listen, share the pain, and then they should decide what to do about them and they should also remember that poverty plays major role in South Africa not only in South Africa but in many countries. I'm not trying to defend the criminals, I'm trying to show reality and trying to put the facts correctly. Let me give you another example, a child was raped by his father and the child went to counselling so that she/he can take out the pain and the father was sentenced to life imprisonment and had never went to therapy after the incident. the anger or the pain that still posses in his will be with him for the rest of his life. Let me think in this way, maybe he had been molsted before during his childhood etc. so he never came to accept that he has the problem that needs to be attended, Let me say that maybe he was black and Lets come reality black don't want to accept that they have the problem that can't be handled by themselves and they don't feel free to talk about it and they don't want to go counselling meaning that they don't believe in therapy. so they end being rapists continue harming the society.
I believe that problems must be solved no matter how hard is the problem at there is an answer, a tunnel. that will help a person to find his/her way out. Lets accept that criminals are human beings just like us and they do have the problem that needs to be solved, and the society must help them so that their lives should be better Living a normal live. A solution to criminals is rehabilitation.

TSNO1009,3.5,3.5,3.0,4.0,4.0,3.5,The prison system is outdated. No civilized society should punish its criminals: it should rehabilitate them,"
Personally I partly agree with the above statement when it says ""the prison system is outdated. The way the police treat prisoners is uncalledfull. The initial establishment of this institutions, I believe was to correct these people, that is why it is called correctional services. Hence they seem to be ignoring the fact that these people (prisoners) are supposed to get out of prison, and go back to the society.
If the constitution of the country would be revisited again; the courts law or decisions be amended, maybe it would serve the purpose and accomodates, satisfy every involved party. After the judgement of the court, The magistrates together with the prison wardens must sit down and agree upon the treatment of prisoners. They must treat them equally, they must not look at which criminal offence did the person commit. Because they appear to be overlooking matters and personalising things. More that correctional services does not have the vivid information pertaining cases they only appear in picture after the person is already sentenced.
Apparently what is happening in prisons its devastating, its making matters worse. The prisoners feel they are being isolated. But they must be given reasons as to why, them specificly are placed where they are. They must be given a reason to understand, to want to see themselves again as members of the society.
Conditions within the prison cells are really harzadous, they must be impoved. Even amongst them (prisoners) its not good, they jeopardise each other's lives. Should they be given reasons to treat each other decently, there would not be killings in prison. The thing is these people lack information, they do not have hope, they need to be assured of the good things that they will be able to do when they come out of those prison doors.
The reason why I say the constitution should be revisited is that, Immediately when a person is sentenced or have a criminal case, automatically in the eyes of our country is labelled a criminal. This person cannot be granted a permission to work anywhere even if his or her qualifications allows him. Meaning is not being taken there to be rehabilitated but to be punished. That thing affects the entire life, because every single application form that you fill asks if you have any criminal case. Automatically you are not given a reason to behave well in prison, you have already lost confidence in yourself. More especially when you are sentenced for many years.
To have a criminal case it is not what you choose deliberately. It might be a conspiracy by your enemies. People should not be judged by the criminal cases that they have, rather be judged by their behaviours or the way they conduct themselves, inside and outside prison. Though there are those prisoners who a willing to change, but being influenced by others to be who they are not.
However the society plays the biggest role in determining who these people really are, after leaving prison. The society distance itself from these people, they see them as criminals, without evaluating if these person changed. Even family members they isolate you, when you are sentenced automatically they forget all about, take you out of family plans. This is really immoral its unethical. It is against the norms and value of the society, there suppose to be unity amongst people no matter what.
In some instances they cannot even be given food, they now resort back to bad things like stealing. What lead to this? The way the society Perceives them. Sometimes they even decide to make prison their homes because they are not welcomed at home. They do not see the neccesity of belonging somewhere. Sometimes even if they are at prison family members and friend do not pay them visits.
If maybe the legislature, Correctional services and the society can emerge and implement an organisation which will deal with problems and matters relating to these conditons it will serve a purpose, not excluding prisoners from this alliance, so that they can raise their concerns and grievances. Together we can make or build a better nation.

As the concerned member of the society, irrespective of which society in this world I don't think criminals should be punished. I wholeheartedly do agree with the above mentioned statement. Each or every offence, whether terrible or not is influenced by some basic reasons which could be researched and come up with a better solution other than punishment.
Committing a crime, just like being infected with HIV epidemic is as a result of so many complicated reasons. Firstly we have to look at factors like demographic factors, geographic factors, social factors, lacking self-esteem or even self confidence all these could be proved. We as the people of this world wherever the silly method is applied also have to look into things like our moral values and our human rights, for an example, to put someone in a condemned cell. This is completely against our morals and the basic rights of human species. The above mentioned factors will be discussed below.
Looking into demographic factors like how much does a bread winner earn a month or there's no source of income at all at home. It is a fact that this is going to encourage that helpless individual to commit a crime negligently and unintentionally in order to earn a living.
Secondly we should look at the geographic factors, where somebody lives - the surroundings - if does this have an effect in committing a crime. We sometimes find that this is a very remote hilly village, communication is not so effective and somebody can end up committing a crime. Lack self-esteem and self-confidence also contribute a lot, and also feeling you're an outcast which is a social factor where you find there's no body to interact with may be lacking your beloved one. At the end you may rape somebody.
Somebody may ask what kind of prison system should be applied. Prisoners should be rehabilitated. We have bodies which can keep crime from deteriorating, eg Psychologists, priests, social workers etc. unlike putting a criminal on a trial and punish him. This could affect him/her psychologically. I also think that age restriction when taking somebody to a prison is applied properly children of the age of 16-21 should not be taken to prison completely they should be guided. You find a 16 year old child in prison, his future is already ruined instead we could have built up something out of him.
The prison system at Botswana is one of the worst systems ever, when death is constitutionally regarded as a system of punishment. Consider that case of Bosch who is now in a death-row, doesn't this underestimate our human rights and our Roman Dutch Law, our English Common Law which says you shouldn't kill/murder. The president of Botswana, an official from human rights refused to forgive Bosch saying not murdering Bosch will be against their constitution and that will tarnish the country's name globally. I think this should be changed. So far the country has murdered 38 people this is against our moral values. killing or murdering is really immoral.
The other one is that of ""Terreblanche"", he was a real monster but now that he was in prison not imprisoned like other prisoners but getting some kind of motivation from a certain pastor there, he is now a born-again. Don't we think the same should be done to other prisoners. Terreblanche was not in prison, but rehabilitation.
In addition to that prisoners should also not be given difficult chores or labour to do. This could also be a motive to them, they become bored, that is why they tend to kill themselves or kill one another even out at a prison. They at should also be given food which are in a condition to be eaten and a better shelter. By doing that they will feel welcomed and tend to behave like human beings.
With all these I think if it could be implemented the society will change. The prison system should be improved and modernized. Prisons must become ""rehabilitation centres"".

The prison system is not able to control the situation of inprisonment. that you would find a person, having a serious case like raping a two years child. The matter start from the court. Judge would say, ""the child have no evidence"". The lawyer appeal on side of the child, this person be in prison only for few months. He is a free man. My arguement is this the society should take further steps. The society should be united, if one person is faced with this problem. All must sympathyze with her.
knowing that if this happen to the next person it might turn and be your problem. how must it be prevented. follow the procedure who was in charge of the case. The doctor whom the parents have taken the child to. If there is no concrete evidence to prove as the comunity we have to consult the Psychologyst and social workers, to speculate the sign of the child who is traumatist. If this dont prove anything as the community we have to sign and agreement of if we find such person in our village, he must receive corparal punishment from the chief. We report him to the police that he must report to the police station after two weeks that he have'nt done any crimal offence.
if he might be reported by any crimal offence he must be sentence to death. according to my arguement this will help. When it comes to rehabilitation centre as the community. this might be a threat to the community. You take a person who dont need any help. Who does intentionerly. Some they really need help like the one who kill his parents. he was in a process of stress.
That everything his parents was saying was the fact. Sometimes when parents are angry they turn out saying the bad things that children feel that they have been neglected they are nothing. They end up in sorrow. the community have to take care of that particular person. This child have to be send to the preist to comfert her to guide him that what he did was wrong but he can change if he is willing to do so.
He can be send to the parents, who have the similar problem. So that they can advice her that they knew it was not his decision to kill his parents. It was only that he kept everything in a negetive way, then he dont have any one to to talk to if he is facing the challeges of life, he regret that if it wa'st his temptation he would have his parents. The society should rehabilitate were is possible.

South Africa is one of the countries, in the world with a high percentage rate of crime. Our prisons are flooded with prisoners, who seems to be enjoying the lifestyle of prison. They are supplied with free food, free clothing, free electricity, free rent, and most of the prisoners find prison to be a warm home, where you are free from hunger, free from coldness and mostly a place where you can stay, and enjoy life. Prisoners are normal human beings with norms and values, everything they do, they do it at of a reason.
I believe that the prison system is outdated, and unless something is done, our prisons will be flooded with people who are lazy to make lives for themselves, people who are not willing to be part of the economic active community. Prisoners, are made up of different types of criminals, we have rapists, murders, people who got arrested because of driving at a high speed, parents who were unable to support their children, and so on. Criminals such as rapists, and people who abuse children, should not be put in jail, but rather, be given community services tasks to do, such as to work at the children's homes, and see how rapes, abuse have affected those children, both emotionally and physically, and I strongly believe that they will learn from their mistakes.
Most prisoners, commit crimes as a result of running away from poverty. They should be provided with counselling, and the society should endeavour to see them getting and being aware of the after effects that victims experienced. The society should not put prisoners in jails, because to them is like helping them. We the society must start to be aware of the reactions of the prisoners, and their lifestyle in jails. Our government must start looking closely into this matter, and with the helping hands of the society, they should think twice about this prison system, and decide on the useful, relevant ways, in which our victims can be saved.
Our prisoners are victims of mislead, they need a direction, to show them that crime is not the only solution to your problems, but an escape. Our lives are very valuable, and we should not waste it by running away from our problems. Every problem is a challenge, and the only way to achieve your goals, is to always taking challenges and chances. Our country has a high rate of crime, and the only way to solve this problem is to rehabilitate our criminals, based on the crime which they have commited. Our children are mostly victims of these crimes, they end up dying of Hiv/Aids, while they are innocent. The only way to help our prisoners is by showing them, the true picture and the suffering that they cause, and after that they will decide for themselves what they want to achieve in life, by helping themselves and being something in our community. Prisons are not solutions to our problems, but only an escape, let the prisoners see the reflection of humanity suffering, and then, my statement will be stated true, as by saying that ""Prison System is outdated, Society should not punish its criminals but rehabilitate them"".

The criminals are people who are take to jail for different crimes that they committed for example a prisoner can be jailed for carhijaking, shoplifting, committing murder and soon.
Any body who destroy other people things or members of the community must be arrested he or she must be taken to jail to pay for what they have done to the community.
There is no symphathy for those kind of people as the prison system say the must be a very good way of dealing with them so that they must not repeat what they did they must get a severe punishment.
The society cannot respect a person who is like that and also doesnot have that sense of humour the is no mercy for that particular person because she or he cannot have mercy for othe people in the area, and outside
The prison system or police must arrest a person who hearts other people by killing them, steeling their things because those people have worked hard to have those things and they mean a lot to them according to me.
They must be arrested because if they dont arrest them we as the society will end up taking law into our hands and buy doing that we can also be jailed so they must do their job because their trained for that.
According to me I can say after they have been arrested and taken to jail they must be given a severe treatment for their evil things that they did they must not be given wellcooked food even wat they must just get a little bid of water to drink when thirsty.
If I was a police I would not even let them get out of the cell for a walk an to get fresh air I would just tell them to stay inside the cell so that they cannot get back to what they did to another person or friends
Sometimes this people are not arrested because the police will just say there is no full evidence about what happened or their cells are overcrowded even witnesses are not there to explain to them.
We as members of the society we must try to co-operate to stop this crime and to help the police with full evidence and ideas.
They must get a punishment and plough what they have planted so that when they are out of jail or completed their sentences they would never get back to what the did before
In my conclusion I can say an injuiry to one is an injuiry to all let us unite co-operate and give different ideas to try to stop this crime
We must work together as children of one mother and fight this bad things.

TSNO1050,1.5,2.0,,,,,The prison system is outdated. No civilized society should punish its criminals: it should rehabilitate them,"
In South Africa crime is a serious epidemic just like Aids/HIV. Crime has been there for a long time and its orgin can not be easily traced.
There are factors which have to be looked into, for crime to be committed. We have to look at the historical background of a criminal, the society in which s/he comes from, level of education, age e.t.c.
The society should not impose punishment on criminals which will deter them but that will rehabilitate them.
The prison system is to take away criminals from the community and put them together in prison cells where they would able to share ""criminal ideas"".
It also makes them fill rejected or unwanted in the society. Thus when they are released from prison they would commit another crime and go back to prison where they are said to belong.
We are told that if a person is infected with HIV/AIDS we should treat such person like any ordinary citizen, but with criminals is different. Why?
If a person has raped another person, such rapist should be rehabilited, by either taking him/her to the rehabilitation institution for rapist if any.
Just like drug abusers are taken to such institutions and why not criminals or the goverment will be saying or it says that prison is the rehabilitation institute for criminals.
Yes it can be a rehabilitation institution to some extend. When a person is give a life sentence, will such sentence rehabilitate him/her? If the answer is yes, the prison system is not outdate.
On the other hand the community need to live peacefully and crime is a problem. Thats where law comes in, to regulate human conduct.
We can not have a crime free society and the reason for prisons is to keep criminals away from the society so they people can live peacefully.
I therefore submit that prison are not good because it needs a lot of money to pay for prison's food, clothes etc and that money is paid by taxpayers who are working hard to earn a living
Prisons should be called rehabilitation institutions for criminals and they should be at least 90% rehabilitated when they come out.
It is also necessary to keep criminals away from the society so that others who intend to commit crime, they should see that crime does not pay.
Criminals should not be role models of kids. Children should see that if they commit crime they will go to prison. That is a lesson to others.

As we all know prison is considered or thought of as a place where holigins and maniac's belong, but as human being's of all characters and behaviour some of us are bond to break the law.
Prison's were built in countries all over to keep anabiding law citizens away from the abiding society. These people are isolated from society so they can think and get their minds together and abide the law. But in recent years this has never been the case because one out of 10 inmales who are released from prison always come back, so meaning that somehow our prison system is failing us.
We always hear stories about how prisoners still indulge in criminal activities even in prison, We hear about how they kill and rape each other in prison, meaning that how can somebody rehabilitate in a society where he is still doing criminal activities. Prisoners in the United States were said to have been mentally ill due to the fact that they were locked up in a dark cell for 22 days with lack of food and water, (Chicago Times ""1994"")
The prison system is outdated and society should not punish it's criminals but rehabilitate them because our prison system has failed to rehabilitate prisoners in order to get them back to society and abide the law. Rehabilitation is one of the brightest ideas that the government thought about. Criminals should be treated as humans and citizens and be shown that they belong in our society like any other citizen. If somebody is isolated from other people he/she feels that they don't belong and they are always going to do the same activities they have been doing if they are not shown or given any attention.
Rehabilitation also helps prisoners learn to survive in society by that I mean that they are taught different skills like for eg (how to read and write, art crafting, sewing, shoe repairing, etc.) Those skills they develope during rehabilitation will gurantee them some income once they are out in the real world. Our Society also should assist ex prisoners in getting job's because once your an ex-prisoner nobody will ever give you a job, and that's the other thing that we have a high rate of ex-prisoners going back to prison after a month's release.
Society should not punish it's criminals but rehabilitate them, in order for humans to live together in a peaceful and law abiding society.

Rehabilitation is a very good idea, but there are disadvantages. When looking at South Africa's conjested prisons rehabilitation, comes as a form of relief to the problem. South Africa's prisons are conjested with juvinile offenders and, it is a shame! If all our young people are in prison who is going to be the future of this country? Here rehabilitation should really be used. Young offenders or juviniles as are called, have potential to change. This is mostly because they resort to crime either for acceptance by a group of friends in other words peer group pressure, or there is no food at home and, or there is no so-called proper home life. So, at the end of the day a young person needs, love, attention, acceptance or are hungry, and just for that they are thrown in jail. Rehabilitation here will teach our young people skills that they can use to make a living. Young people will also get councilling to help them cope with the situation at their different homes even, the fact that they don't need a group to be the best they could be. This sounds stupid but, we need to realise that sometimes one needs to be told that one is the best to feel that way. So, rehabilitation here would most definitley be to the best advantage. This for me should also apply to first-time offenders and 'petty offenders.'
'Petty offenders' for me are for example shoplifters and homeless people who are jailed or imprisoned for traspassing, just because he/she slept on someone's property. All the above mentioned need to be rehabilitated not imprisoned. Imprisonement in these cases would be scratching the wound and not dealing with the problem, the real problem. Society needs to wake up and smell the roses, to the fact that the problem is not stealing food but, it is the fact that the person is hungry. The need is for us to read between the lines, to see the problem behind the problem. All these children that we as society call dangerous are just children. Children who need to loved, fed and protected. As the society we need to go back and re-read the book we red on compassion and caring for others. I am not saying we should condone crime. No. We should fix what can still be fixed. What I mean by that is that when looking at hardened criminals we must be careful but still try to help. Help here means without stereotypes. I personally would not release a murderer who has killed time and time again to rehabilitation. No ways this would be a wast of the tax payers money and energy. When a person see no-wrong in what they have done I say lock them up and throw away the key. But, this is just but one persons opinion mine!
Remember, your children have the right to safety, so, when a hardened criminal gets sent to rehab your money is wasted. Which means you can't buy those burglar bars for your house, incase a hardened criminal gets released by a technical error. Those things do happen you know?
Anyway, like I said this is just but one persons opinion MINE!

Rehabilitation is the best prevention for crime, the reason being that prison make criminals to become worse. Rehabilitation may be in the way of councelling conducted by the psychologists. Councelling is all about breaking the silent from criminals. What makes them to commit crime? They must tell the psychologists.
Another way of councelling may be to work for the community like keeping the environment clean and also to attend rehabilitation school to be tought about how they should behave. Others may be released at prison to stay at home and not to go any where.
Young generation are the most people who had become criminals by hijacking, house breaking and also killing other people. Rehabilitation would be the best suit for them. But also the older people will be the best.
When prisoners are kept for many years at prison they learn the norms and behaviour of prison and they become very dangerous for the society. The reason being they are not used to leave with the community.
The government is spending more money to feed prisoners on daily basis. Furthermore, since our constitution of South Africa gives every one the rights, prisoners have their own fundamental rights. Right to freedom of speech, when they are not happy with the situation in prison such as food, health and others. This rights make prisoners to like staying in prison and prison became their home.
Rehabilitation is not a costy or expensive way of keeping criminals out of prison. However, to combat crime in the country street kids must be looked after. They must have a home to stay and also to be educated. The reason of educating kids is to produce the best generation for the future. Gang stars should be combated also.
The scarecity of job should be combated. People must be tought how to create jobs for themselves - so that crime would be decreased.
The breaking down of marriages is also the course of crime and rehabilitation is needed especially when the kids from that marriage became criminals because of parents-less or one would look after them. Again, because of hunger they would just breake the shops to find food.
A rehabilited person suit the community, protect the community and also help them in all or some difficulties they comeacross because his beheviour is now changed.
Criminals at prison are still humanbeing that is why we say that they need rehabilitation. For example, some of them they are born again and became christian in prison; some form gospels to sing and pray all the time and some became prists at prison.
In the past years prisoners were treated like animals because they were beaten up, working on sunny condition to hole day and not eating with time. Now because corporal punishment is prohibited and there is no death sentence, rehabilitation is the best.

The republic of South-africa has the highest crime rate in the world; which is perpentuated by either the prison system or unemployment and other aspects.
60% of the population in South africa is unemployed hence the escalating number in crime reports. Many people turn to crime not out of their own will, but because of the anfavourable life conditions they find themselfs in; remember we did not choose to reside in this crime infested country; but we live here any-way.
The republic must stop squanduring money on arms and it must start to rehabilitate its criminals rather than punishing them. I am not saying that criminals must be let free undeceplined or unpunished; the problem is how you carry out that punishment. We are dealing with human beings not animals even though they lost or jeorperdised their humanity by engaging in crime.
As a parent you do not punish your child with anger or wrath after he or she has done something wrong; you do that with love showing him or her that he or she has done someting wrong they still remain your children. The manner you use, in punishing them will make them aware that they still belong in the family and they are still accepted, and that will encourage them to change their behaviour and become respectable  members.
Like-wise; the prison system must punish and rehabilitate its criminals, so that they become respectable citizens when they are released. Let them pay for their misconduct and then instiltheir humany and human rights by rehabilitating them.
It is no use to keep them in prison for 15 yrs and then release them after. In prison they learn all the wrong things, they join gangsters and even become more crime infested than the day they walked in prison. In prison is where they graduate in their criminal activities because all the criminals are infested there, they become more wicked and dangerous because the society is treating them like outcasts or the worst sinners.
The government should engage them in rehabilitation programes, so that they must come out being better people and educate the youngsters who see crime as something exiting.
They must bring a positive infleence to the community and that other youngsters should leave from their makes, and then South-africa will become a crime free country, because all criminals will be rehabilitated and given a second chance to life and be accepted back in the community.

The prison system is outdated, it doesn't help the criminals instead it makes them even worse than before. They all stay in a same place and their all criminals so they are give each some criminal ideas. When they get out of Prison they have collected all the criminal ideas. They know things that they didn't know before. In jail some Prisoners give up hope especialy if their family dont come to check them.
And in prison some policemen abuse the prisoners thinking their are punishing them. And prisoner become bitter and immotional frustrated Sometimes justice was not done and an innocent person is in prison. By the time he getout of prison he is already a criminal. And some of the them did crime because they were insane or in a lot of stress. In some cases like commiting a murder its a mistake or selfdefence
As A society we should not punish them by sending them to prison. Its is also a waste of money to send them there. To pay tax for people who are going to do worse thing than before. Because of their ideas their got from each orther. so we are not helping the society by Paying for them to steal for use When they get out. And for those are innocent and insane.
I think the best thing is to rehabiliate them. At list from that we will see Where We are going We will have a better and a safer country by rehabiliating them. It is not a waste of tax money to find them help instead of making the worse.
Instead of punishing innocent people and those who are guilty we should be helping them. They will be punished in heaven. I think everyone has a right to be given a second chance to put him/herself together We h can all learn from our mistakes and taking resposiblility of our wrongs by going to the rehabiliation. By doing that we will be doing a best thing ever.
Its a waste of money by innocent people to jail to become criminals The crime rate in our country will reduce. We will see a big difference by doing that
By punishing a person by giving him a death pernaly is a stupid idea no one has a right to take another ones' life. They must know that the one who pass the judgement is not the one who is going to t do the job. Sometimes the justice was not done and an innocent person is sentenced to death.
Sometimes in prison they take a long time to kill a person and keep him in jail for a long time they make him safer emmonionaly and in case when a person is innocent is tromatrazing. By the time justice has been done in too late. Because he is know a criminal because of the infivence and the pressure of orthe Prisoners
By sending them to rehabiliatig centre can help the country to reduce crime and innocent people will not be criminals so we are not adding useless numbers of criminal people in our country by sending them to rehabiliation we are decreasing the number.
And for kids who are under 21 yrs and in prison they must find help of rehabiliation. Sometimes a person is in a jail for stealing food. That person is not a criminal and they have no right to send him to jail. They must j first look for the reasons Why that kid stole the food.
It is a wast of Money to Pay for small thing in our coutry By sending him to jail they him a criminal. They must send him to homes of Street Kids by doing that it will help him not damaging his mind

TSNO1135,3.0,3.0,,,,,The prison system is outdated. No civilized society should punish its criminals: it should rehabilitate them,"
I think yes the prison system is outdated because when a criminal is being imprisoned there are no resources for them to be rehabilitated. The more they get caught is the more they empower their criminal skills. There are more petty criminals, he or she goes to shoprite or Pick 'n Pay, they steal just a mere chocolate and get caught so they are then taken to court where they are sentenced to a period of six months. After that six months they are released being hardened criminals.
Instead of criminals to go to prison to get help, they go to waste the taxpayers money. They are there to get more advanced and more matured, for in case you take an eighteen year old to prison for a very bad crime like rape, house breaking and so forth. He goes to prison for a maximum period of ten or twelve years, instead of being taught useful skills, he is taught how to play soccer, volleybal and so on. They teach him the things he did not bother playing whereas he knew how to play but instead chose a wrong career of being a rapist or house breaker.
The prison authorities must take it into consideration that when they imprison a criminal they must not give him luxuries but rehabilitate them. They must use that taxpayer's money to hire qualified people and have advanced skills like teaching them how to read and write. Most prisoners are illiterate and when they get out of prison they do not get employment, they then resort to their criminal activities because they see that they are the menace to the society. They look at things from a different angle and see that by being a nuisance outside, he'd rather be a nuisance in prison where nobody from the outside can see.
There are many people who appealed to most correctional services authorities, trying to make them aware of the situation in their correctional services department regarding their system on how they deal with criminals but instead they ignore the plea of the community as a whole.
I think it is a high time where we will have make sure that everyone who goes out of prison is well enough to live with people because now people are living in fear because everytime a prisoner gets free, the people starts panicing asking themselves, what is he or she up to this time.
Even the correctional services must pull up their socks and assure people and community in general that, when ever a prisoner is set free, he comes out being a better person.

TSNO1145,3.0,2.5,,,,,The prison system is outdated. No civilized society should punish its criminals: it should rehabilitate them,"
To start with, for something to happen; there must have been a cause, like wise, for prison system to be established, there were a considerable number of factors which were mushrooming, therefore the following are some of such factors; theft, rape, tribalism, Poverty and many more others, not mentioned.
Firstly if I was cought in the act of stealing, the first thing and the best thing that the low think of is imprisonment, whereas precoution measures should have been applied, For example. I Should be asked where I come from, why I diceded to do that, and if possible be taken home so as to analyse why I came to steal. Maybe I stole becase I wanted to feed my family. If its from that angle, then I Should not be taken to prison, insted I should be given a task or work, even if I'm not educated so that I will be able to feed my poor family. If I'm doing it out of gratitude then I must be taken to prison on harsh. Conditions and if posibble one hand should be Cut off because its the one that does the stealing, if I Continue, one leg should be taken off becase its the one that does the walking. Secondly people who rape should be counselled and maybe tought with literal examples of the damage they have done on somebody, if this is to no avail, well I suggest no imprisonment, what I think should be done is cashation for both male and females to end this unclean behavior.
However this are just Ideas, but Can be of help if taken into Consideration. In Iraque I herd such punishment are used; and Rumour continues that in that Country even if you walk alone at any hour of the night, you will have peace around you; get me right, I m not saying there is no crime in that country, but minor crime is strictly dealt with, that people being packed into prison camps for little crimes.
Lastly trabalism is also a contributary factor, in that, in one Country there are two tribes with different belives, Culture, and history, and when it comes to power, however, one tribe is not fully representd, this leads to that tribe in power, electing only its own people to power on the contrary to the other one, this result in fighting, gansterish and more people being taken to prison, Some for the crimes they did not comit, but just because they belong to the minority tribe. thus prison camps are wrongly used. The fact that the prison systeams are outdated, moreover they are old and not habitable, for instance, you find that a cell or a room is in one place with a toilet, how does one eat or even sleep with a smell of stench all around him. Moreover how do fife people sleep in a cell meant for one. you will find that we are trying to solve a problem with a problem, because in those cells prosioners develop bad behaviours like a male having sex with a male, and this result in incouraging diseases like H.I.V aids and other sextually transmitted diseaseses.

If we can see nowadays, its clear to us that crime is high and its one of the major problems facing South Africa as a whole. Due to unemployment, some or most turn to crime and end up in prison.
Most of these criminals turned up in prison because of pressure of some sort, or even some neccessities needed at a particular time. Most of them even regret having done this and try to change for the better. Our prisons are so full that the government decided that those prisoners convicted for minor crimes and have less than seven years should be released. For me, those prisoners are still suffering because society doesn't give them a chance to prove that they can be humans like us again. They are in so much pressure that they dont know where to run, some end up doing crime again, but some lucky ones find a helping hand. Its not like they dont have skills, but these people are mechanics etc and some need chance to furhter their studies. Thats why prison authorities realised that and brought facilities into prison. Today we find prisoners being taught standard ten in prison, being taught so many skills in order that when they get out there, they would know where to begin. To me, they are given a foundation and the key of a new life.
Society should help also to make them feel free to explore, and not treat them like strangers who will always be like that to them. We all do mistakes at one time in life, but to most of us, these people's mistakes are not forgiven. We are the ones on the other hand who contribute to them ending up in prison. We should allow them into society and make them forget their past
I agree that there are those who belong there, but lets not forget that not all of them. Some enjoy prison life, but some would want to see themselves out of bad influence of friends and others which contributed a lot for them ending in prison. Its also interesting that these prisoners send messages out there that prison life is no good, that it is bad and would want to change after getting out. For me, that shows that we have humans in there, we have people who are like us, who have hearts and want to repent.
Society of today should learn to be two sided and not favour. We should all be given equal chance to life like God did for creation.

TSNO1161,3.0,3.0,,,,,The prison system is outdated. No civilized society should punish its criminals: it should rehabilitate them,"
The word prison is particularly a place where criminals, or people who have broken the law are kept to be rehabilitated.
However what is being practiced in Prisons is ill-treating other humons unhumanly like cats and dogs. There are several matters that put these peoples lives in danger and risk of diseases. The first obvious one is accomodation. The prison compares around the country are so crowded but the government is still sending more and more people into custody. People end up catching infectous diseases like tuberculosis.
The society also must consider that nobody was born a criminal so the system of locking up both hard criminals and first offenders is entirely out-dated. The big bullies tend to ill-treat the new comers and on the other hand teach them the skills of committing crime. Somebody can just commit crime but that being not his initial intension. Consequently facts like puberty force most people to commit crime. There must be a system of dealing with first offenders and even hard criminals not just locking them up like prisoners of war.
On the other hand is the food given to inmates. Athough these people have committed crime I think they must be given proper food  for human beings. Giving them samp is like showing them that they are no longer needed in the society. These strickly shows that they are onother kind of nation which should have its leaders.
Labour in prison is also the main fact that does not go coherrently with the word to rehabilitate. They are forced to work like slaves which at the other times force some of them to escape. The authorities don't give them proper jobs that will enable them to cope with life when their term terminates. They are given jobs which are totally meant to show that they are being punished.
I think its hard time the Society as a whole have a cristian heart and took these people as human beings not sluts. It must be considered that initially these people were among us and ask ourself on what ectually made them to commit crime. Recreational games should be introduced in Prisons and educational objectives be implemented, not just to teach someone how to write his/her name.
It must be considered that athough these people have broken the law they have skills. People like Mzwakhe MBULI show an example and there are many more people who can be beneficiary to the society. In conclusion its hard time the authorities take advices from the society and even prisoners on how to deal with these situation. If we don't get along with these situation puperty, and crime won't be reduced.

TSNO1166,3.0,3.0,,,,,The prison system is outdated. No civilized society should punish its criminals: it should rehabilitate them,"
The prison system is outdated because when offenders are convicted they are sent to prison to serve their sentences. They are watched twenty four hours, fed, taken care of and sent to doctors when sick. Some of the prisoners never worked before so they use the tax payers and their victims money. After they finished their sentences they are released to be free to become law respecting citiziens unfortunately this is not always the case, some learn that to be kept away from people they love is painful. They learn that to be a law breaker does not pay or benefit. Some do not care, case were reported were a prisoner was released within hours of that release he committed another crime. To those prisoners, the prison system does not help but keep them away from the society, where they did not have any access to a doctor, proper food or electricity. Prison becomes a home to those offenders and become pain to the victims for the are still hurt, becomes a problem of ever increasing crime and overcrowded prisons to the government
To keep prison away from the society in order for them not to commit another crime might seem alright as a punishment. The hope of those prisons to change for better is not high. Prisons should be transformed into a community building project. As we have gathered information from around us or the media that young people are the ones who commit crime mostly. The project should provide skills which will help them to make a living, Because most offenders are not skilled thus they cannot find employment that result to theft or robbery. They should be taught life skills and morals. As some of the offenders are from backgrounds were there were no moral, standards. For an example a child raised by an alcoholic and aggressive father and a submissive mother who never finished school is likely to end up being a lawbreaker because he was never taught that taking whats not yours was not right. The project should also teach offenders discipline and communication. They should also be able to communicate effectively after having their desired skill and are ready to face the world as changed and reformed people.
This project may minimize the rate of crime since the first offenders will not repeat the same mistakes. Yes it a mistake to most of the young people to rob, rape and steal that they find themselves in the wrong company at the wrong time. Employment in general to offenders and society could be created if this project is considered.
We cannot solve the problem if we do not know the root of it. Unemployment, peer pressure lack of good morals are the real cause of crime.

It was spring time, gone were those miserable winter days, no more having to keep warm under blankets and wearing thick jerseys, the weather was warm bright and sunny. Most of the prisoners would have enjoyed the sun turn but there was no such thing to them.
The prisoners where locked up as if they were monkeys on the zoo, dressed in dirty outfits that were brownish in colour eventhough there were naturally cream white. Some where just arriving from being weeped back to their cells, Their body full of fresh wonds that would heel only if you leave time as the chancellor.
They all looked sad as if someone had just pounded them with sad news. They were waiting for a spoon full of porrige which was not nicely cooked. All the food was partly cooked as if it was going to be served for curnivorous animals. As I sat there watching them I realised that some prisoners eyes were full of hope hope that someday somehow, miracles will save them. But some have done that for many years to no avail.
The prison guds did not treat them like human being. How can a human being eat next to his uncleaned toiled that was pure toture I saw. Some were to clean places that were made dirty by the police and they were forced by the fact that if you dont do as they say you will be in jail for the rest of your life.
People are also crouded like animals they dont have the right for privacy. Prison rape is also common young boys are raped by elder men who treat them as their wives and the spread of Disease is at a high rate. as a small room is shared by a lot of people. Even the killer disease is spreading because of jail Rape.
There is no protection. Some stronger criminals beat others and the community is doing nothing to help. Some people are even killed during the fight with coleques and no action is being taken.
Preason is hell in life and its a pity some are jailed for crimes that they did not commit.
The prison system is very outdated especally nowdays when there are so many desease, People should look at things in a brighter way and not treat people as animals even though they had comited crime they have the right to freedom, the right to good food and the right to socialise. Their wifes should have time to meet with them and socialise. Even their husbands in case of women.
The prisons are very outdated they are old buldings with cockroches, Rats and an evil smell. I think the society should not purnish its criminals but rehabiliate them. The society has to think again and organise something better.

Society should not punish its criminals because when they take the law into their hands by Punishing their criminals they end up killing them. These criminals must answer for that bad things that do within the society.
If someone did wrong we must take him/her to the Police station and the court will - see whether this crimal is the one that cause the crime. If there is a lack of evidence then that crimals will set free. Some people do crime because they are short tempered. For an example a husband and wife maybe a wife can do many mistakes that her husband did'nt like it, and the husband keep on warning her. At the end he kill her. That husband he must not taken to court. He must be taken to People who will help him. Members of his family should comfort him/her. He/she must be taken to the psychologist/social workers, so that they can talk to him/her and he/she will saw his/her mistakes rather than taken to court.
When she/he will taken to court he/she will be out of bail. Then the society will Punish him/he for his/her wrongs. We should talk to him show him/her wrongs. Then I think at the end she/he ask for mercy because he/she will saw that he/she had done wrongs.
Look at the case of Mamokgethi Malebane of Katlehong Location of Gauteng Province. Someone came to fetch her at school and then he rape her. After weeks the society knows that he is the one who raped the child. Then he lives with fear. He knows that he is going to be killed at anytime.
Then he was at Prison for almost a month then out of bail. Then society did not like that thing because the child suffers some injuries the time he rapes her. For him to Protect himself One day he goes to school where child is a learner and taken her to the bush raped her again and kill her. But at the end society knows that he is the one who is responsible for the child's death.
I think that the first time when that man rape this child, he must be taken to the Psychologist so that he can speak out his problems. I think that if it was so the child will be still alive this time. We the society we must not rush into things. Let the law and Psychologists do their work. If we take crimals to the Psychologists they will try to show him/her that he/she had done wrong and show him the rights and wrongs then I thought he will came back to the society. He will be the right person again.
Many deaths occurs because we the society we do not rehabilitate that criminals instat we want to take the law into our hands.
I thought if we can Proceed on rehabilitating criminals high rate of crime will be less. No One will be afraid of one another. We can go whatever we want to at anytime. Nowerdays we live with fear. I am afraid to walk there at Mafikeng town carrying my wallet on my hands because everybody looks on it. Because if they saw it they will ask you to give it to them or they will kill you.
So I thought rehabilitation will decrease the crime and death rate. Society should not Punish its criminals let's try to talk to them. Let us show them the right way. To Punish them will not solve anything. They will keep on doing the wrongs. If you know someone with high criminal rate Please took her/her to the people who will help him/her. Don't just leave them that's why they carry on doing the same thing.

Society should not punish the criminals but try to motivate them or to bring them to their normal lives. No one is allowed to be punished, but to advised about what she/he was doing. This can be solved by inviting psychologists to give them free lessons about their behavior and also the society should be invited to tell them about how they behave in their community. As an individual, you can avoid yourself in many things for an example to be a criminal, youth group and sports should be formed.
Is a responsibility of the society to motivate the criminals, not to bring them to prison because they are human beings just like anybody. They have their needs in life, they are normal. The society should councel them about how are they doing to be in future. This, can affect them in their mentality. They can be given life sentence if they don't behave well for example if the society tell you about the advantages and disavantages of what you have being all along then you don't take them into consideration, is then that you are judged for a life sentence.
The psychologist should also invited to councel them about what is going to happen in future.
If you are a criminal, there are some forces that forced you do that, for example if you see a beautiful car, you will steal it for the purpose of money, simply means you are under pressure. They are various ways of getting money not to put yourself in danger. You can go to school and become educated and finally you can get a job.
Youth groups should be build by the society so that many people could take part. There must be some dramas or music so that they can keep theirselves busy. The aim of this youth groups is to avoid people to misbehave.
Also the society should build sports. The sports offices should be there to help people in sport activities e.g. soccer, netball, tennis, high jump etc. People should take part on this activities to keep themself healthy and strongly, because their muscle are working every day.
As a person or an individual, you have to avoid yourself in doing wrong thing. The society can call psychologist, youth groups and sports can be formed but if you don't want to change your bad attitude to people, there is nothing we can do. A person should chancge by his or her own mistakes.

No matter how the society may look at this issue I does not support the above statement. The prison system is not outdated. Despising the fact that these prisoners are our dear brothers and sisters they deserve to suffer the pain they have put themselve in it by going through the right channel which other victims onced faced.
If we may try to compromise and say the society should not punish its criminal, but rehabilitate them how? This is to make matters worse. They would not know that everyone have the right live and freedom to his life not boundaries and living under fear of a human being. For instead murderous this people are very dangerous to other's life. They do not deserve to leave in a company of human being the reason being there are thugs. They do not want to behave like people of blood and flesh who have feeling instead choose to take animals positions. So animals and human beings cannot share a room instead one have to find a way out.
You may realise that most of sometimes rude animals like lions are always put separate from others because there are very dangerous to other's life. Same applies to this crooks they must be isolated from other human being. So that special attension can be given to them in a particular place at a certain period of a time, by trained people who can teach them a lesson.
There are lot of things that can be done by the society not wasting time on people who spend their time on stealing, raping, murdering as a hobby. Some of this people if you try to talk to them, they don't even listen and just remain the same. To them this is like go ahead. You know fox never leave their movement. They just carry it until they die. So some of this criminals are like fox. They take prisons as their homes. If there are not in prison, they try all means to be their, by just repeating same mistake so why should we waste our time with such a person is better to live him in that place until he told himselve that he is going to change.
The society can try by all means to mould and talk to these criminals but if they don't want to change we cannot force them. You can drive a horse to the pond but if it does not want to drink you cannot force it. So let this people experience life behind the bar so that one day when one sun arise may bring to them a light in their mind and start to leave a new life of respecting themselve. Because once they respect themselve always they will extend that respect to other human beings. Otherwise prison system will never be outdated instead a home for those who will choose to leave in captivity.

A prison is a place where people who have broken the law are kept. It is believed that when a person comes form prison he would behave in a good and accepted manner. O the otherhand, others do not change, instead they are even worse because they learn bad things from others.
I would say that prisoners should be trained on different skills like being on auto mechanic and later awarded certificates. This will help them to survive after they are released from prison. For instance they can be self employed and hire the community to work with them. By so doing they will be helping themselves as well as the members of the community. We know that nowadays it is very difficult for a person to get a job so when these people are trained they will create employment for the helpless people and thereby earning a living. If we take home-craft as another skill to be delivered to these rehabilitated people. These people will be household chores like cooking, hygiene as well as needle-work. When they are released, they can find employment in resturants, hotels and bakeries to mention a few which are growing everyday, and thereby earning a living. They can also group themselves
Secondly, the government should introduce - projects and must fund them. These projects should be under close supervision by the government. These people should be borrowed a certain amount of money and use it to develop themselves. The money have to be returned after a certain period of time when these people have produced something out of it. For example, one can open a small business or they can even group themselves and start a big business. By so doing this will create employment for the people and therefore improving their standard of living. Again the government should make sure that everyone who has borrowed the money uses it accordingly. For example, if a person has borrowed the money to start a business and then later uses the money for buying a car which was not the purpose for borrowing that money, strict measures should be taken against such people because they will be misusing the government's money.
The third point to consider is that people are not really taken care of when they are at prisons. You will find that the kitchen, cells, toilets and bathrooms are dirty but there are people using them. These people will end up giving in because there is nothing they can do about it. Even the food is not always clean. I have been told that sometimes you will find a cockroach in your food and when you complain the officers will tell them that if they are hungry they would eat them but if they do not eat it meant that their stomachs are full. Futhermore, health is very important. When people are at a prison they are less cared for. But when they are being rehabilitated they are taken care of. They stay in a clean environment. They are also given clean and balanced meal to keep them healthy.
The last point to consider is that these people should be told that they are like other people who need help. They should know that they are cared for and needed by the community. They should not be looked upon like bad people but should be given a sence of belonging. They should not be engaged in hard and strenous activities. Instead they should be guided and counselled. When people are at prison they start to misbehave even those who used to behave well. This is because they mix with whose behaviour is said to be bad and start behaving like them. When these people are guided and counselled they can behave well including the bad one because they are given direction. In addition to this the spread of diseased such as HIV AIDS can be reduced since they will taught about how to behave
The counsellors should be those people with a heart, those who are willing to help criminals. They should make criminals feel free to share their stories of offenses with them. The counsellors should make criminals feel that they are with them and can help them so solve their problems. When rehabilitation time is over, the criminals should be praised for having co-operated with the counsellors
In conclusion I would like to say that in most cases, prisons cause harm then good to prisoners. It is much better when criminals are being rehabilitated than being taken to prison. This is because at rehabilitation centre for instance, they are really taken care of and feel that they are at home. When they are at a prison they are like being abused because they are criminals and therefore should be punished which is not good.

The South African prison is to a certain extent outdated. The community at large does not accomodate ex convicts back into society but instead, they are outcast. In this essay I will discuss how the prison system is outdated, how it can be improved, and why ex convicts are outcast and how the community should accept them back.
The South African prison system is outdated in that, it does not assist the convicts to adapt back into the society. Prisons should employ a system that is used in advanced countries such as the USA where prisoners are educated at university level. This enables and empowers an ex convict to be resourceful in the community after their release. Even manual work training is essential, but only a few prisons employ that system.
After being released, criminals should assemble to form a group of entrapeneurs, especially those who have aquired skills while serving their sentences. Although capital will be difficult to aquire, there are sponsors willing to help and rehabilitate ex cons. Therefore, the community should put their stigma aside and view these prisoners as tickets to making and developing their community. These ex convicts lift the community's and contry's economic status.
It is clearly comprehendable why ex convicts are outcast from the community but there are ways in which people can monitor the actions of criminals. People are concerned that if ex convicts are allowed back into their community, they will commit various crimes again. There is a way in which criminals can be monitored, especially those who have commited sexual offences, whether against children, women or men.
In the US, when a prisoner is due to be released, the community is informed about him and the offences. This assists the community in knowing about the criminal, especially sexual offenders. Thus, this means that the community has accepted/needs to accept the criminal back into their community, and if he relocated, the other community too is informed about them.
Yes, it is difficult to accept criminals back into the community in fear of them repeating their illegal deeds, but the community should learn to live with criminals and not stigmatize against them. We should learn to rehabilitate them in including them in community events/activities.
Although criminals have commited gruesome acts, it is possible that one can realise the detremental effect it has on them and their community. Therefore, most criminals do become rehabilitated and usually do more good than harm if given a chance, and the benefit of doubt. Thus they're giving back to the community and uplifting the livelihood of the community, especially economically.
People must understand that criminals have served their sentences and punishments, this means that they have accepted that they did wrong. They are thus showing remorse and in a way asking for forgiveness from the community. The society have to see criminals as tools in which they can economically uplift their community, as they have aquired skills in prison that most people don't have.

The notion of prisoner rehabilitation implies that the inmate needs to be changed. From this notion, it follows that the prison is an ideal place for this change to take place. It is assumed that intensive techniques that will reconstitute the offender so he will live ""responsibly"" in the freeworld can be imposed on the inmate in a highly structured situation. Such notion are not illogical if one believes there is specific factors that can be administered to bring about REHABILITATION. And it is helpful if one ignores basic inconstencies in the environment in which these programs are to be instituted in an environment of fear, aggresion, totalitarianism and exploitation
Therefore, the society should not punish their criminals but rehabilitate them, because imprisonment is a waste of money. The government uses a lot of money building prisons and employing people who work in prisons. For example, in South Africa, over 3000 people are being trained to work with crime. Futhermore, the government is trying to ensure that there is no overcrowding in prison, which means it has to deal with money. In Empangeni, Qalakabusha Prison has been made bigger and the government is planning to increase also the size of Kokstad Closed Maximum and Devon Pre-Release centre near Springs.
Similarly, prisoners are bought food and clothes. In Botswana prisoners are well fed and more money is being spent also in their medical expenses. Moreover, they are bought soccer kits as their teams are in super league. In addition, their shelters are being comforted by nice beds and the houses they live in are electrified. The money the government spent in prisons could have been used in charity societies to assist disadvantaged people like old people, blinds, crippled people and orphans.
Furthermore, people's dreams are being defered. In other ways, talented people are denied the opportunity to expose their talents. For example, musicians like Mzwakhe Mbuli is now imprisoned and he is no longer singing. This is a waste of people's talents.
Prisons system exploits people in which they are separated from their families and friends.
Children miss their parents and they are being expelled from schools and they do not have anyone to pay their school fees. Some children leave school because they do not have good parental advice. Moreover, they do not have anyone to tell them how good education is.
Similarly, if we take Zimbabwe's land reform, innocent people are being arrested because they failed to heed deadline to leave their farms. The government could have asked farmers to share their land with poor people not to take it by force. All These lead from the goverment who stepped its efforts to seize white-owned land as it rounded up more farmers defying eviction notices.
In conclusion, I urged that criminals should be rehabilitated to avoid waste of money by the government in criminal premises. An after rehabilitation criminals should ignore basic inconsistancies in the environment as it has been suggested earlier. This, as I think will decrease poverty and the country developments will not be affected as such.
Prison people are also our problem because they affect our progresses. As people we have to think about prisoners as being criminals or decrease crime rather than labelling them by name of criminals. Words like murderers and thieves should not be used as they are offensive, negative labels that demean and devalue the person as a whole.

TSNO1410,3.5,3.5,,,,,The prison system is outdated. No civilized society should punish its criminals: it should rehabilitate them,"
Our prison system is an ideal place for killers, rapers and all those other monsters, instead of being a refuge for them, thus helping them to change their wicked ways. For their own good and our peace of minds, criminals should be converted into better human beings than be made into the worst and indecent human beings.
Going to prison, for most criminals, has become the best way of acquiring skills to help them be better at their deeds, when come out. Some of them commit crimes when they come out of prison because, they had been used indecently in their cells, by their in-mates or even the prison wardens. They had either been raped, burnt, or even beaten up, so they become rebellious. Others learn bad habits in prison, like smoking dagga, stealing, killing people or selling drugs. Thabo, an ex-convict, is now a thief, a gang-master and a drug dealer because that is what he learnt from prison. ""The warden, Thembela, who was my buddy, used to sell drugs to us and I learnt from him, the channels and ways of acquiring them"". This clearly indicates that our prisons are higher institutions for criminals.
Futhermore, James, another ex-convict who sells second hand cars, said he got his skills of hijacking cars and completely covering his tracks from a police friend, who gets thirty-five percent of the profit. ""Morake has taught me well, now I can even do it without holding a gun and you would never know what hit you, then I just relax and enjoy myself with a prostitute"", he boasted. Seeing the look of disgust on my face, he adds wickedly, ""When the money is real good, I prefer a threesome"". Despite the fact that AIDS messages are being preached everyday, he seemed not to care. As if that was not enough, he told me that the reason why he is never worried is because the victims run away without taking a good look at him or they are ""never there to pull shit on me!"", meaning that he kills them.
In addition to that, he said ""if it's a man or an ugly woman, I kill them before they know or realise what's happening, but if it's a beautiful woman, I have a taste of that forbidden fruit first and when I've had enough, he has to die, I don't have any choice"". He says that with a shrug of the shoulder as if it doesn't matter. The way he explained the whole thing to me, without even feeling guilty almost made me want to vomit. Prison has robbed criminals of their consciousness, they don't even have feelings anymore. Hurting other people or killing them is just playing soccer or playing chess to those criminals. To them, it is just normal.
One would actually ask-questions like; ""If our prisons are like that, where are we headed as a society?"" ""When is it all going to stop, if we are making the situation bad instead of correcting it?"" ""Don't we think that instead of punishing those criminals, we must rathe rehabilitate them?"" According to reseachers, punishing them, only makes them more rebellious, but correcting them by giving them some form of education and counselling may help them to be better members of the society. They should be taught how to earn a decent living out of the little that they have. For example, they could be taught to make hand crafted objects, or plant crops and sell them for a profit.
Lastly, I would say that not all prisoners are criminals, so, the society must not treat them like outcasts because, instead of making them it would break them. Just like new born babies, they need nurturing. They also need to know that we do care and they are our fellow human beings, our brothers, our sisters, not monsters to hate and be afraid of.

TSNO1416,3.5,3.5,,,,,The prison system is outdated. No civilized society should punish its criminals: it should rehabilitate them,"
From my own point of view or opinion I agree with the above statement which says the prison system is outdated, therefore society should not punish its criminals but rehabilitate them.
Before I could go on raising my points that criminals should be rehabilitated, I would like to put more emphasis on the key words from the title, i.e. defining some key words like prison, society, criminals and rehabilitation. I would say that a prison is a place where the people who do wrong or commit a crime are kept under the close watch of some guards until a stipulated period of time depending of the weight of a offence or may be for one's whole life imprisonment. Society is in actual fact the people who are part of the community in a certain place. Criminals are the wrong doers. Lastly I could say that rehabilitation as a matter of fact is a place where the people who commit crime are kept to be reformed. They are counselled and taught different skills.
Rehabilitation centres can make a person to be productive in future .i.e. rehabilitation centres do not demoralise people like as it is the case in prisons where people are overworked. The society as well should find a way of creating jobs for people.
Therefore, I strongly say that the people who commit a crime should be sent to rehabilitation centres instead of prison for punishment as they would be aggravating the situation. Prisons though are part of a place to keep the wrong doers as from the past has many negative things towards the people who commit crimes. Firstly if one sent to prison, even for a slight mistake obviously the person would loose dignity not only from his/her family but also from the community at large. The prison guards at the prisons do not treat prisoners well, they treat them like slaves and animals, though they want to show people that being a prisoner is not good so that people, do not commit crimes. They kind of dehumanise the prisoners. They would make them work in harsh conditions, they chair them to hospitals which is not good. I think everybody in the world or rather on earth under the sun has got the right to live and no one is more equal to others in the eyes of God. In a nutshell, I would say no one if perfect. Therefore the society should consider sending the criminals to rehabilitation centres. Inflicting a pain on someone would not solve anything. I mean everything would just end in vain. Some people have got reasons of commiting crimes.
There are quiet a number of things to be done instead of sending a person to prison like a new system called home/house arrest even though it seems not be widely used. House arrest is one of the good systems of handling prisoners. Prisoners can be rehabilitated and then be house arrested. When you are house arrested, and ankle ring is put round your which is electronified and it restricts your movement i.e you only move in the house and you cannot go beyond that. House arrest is good because you can spend more time with your family and relatives and the police always check you regularly to see if you are still there.
The other reason I want people to be rehabilitated is that prisons are not healthy nowadays because of congestion in the prisons. The food is not always good, the blankets and even the rooms they sleep in. You can imagine just a bunch of men crowded in one room! Some of the prisoners because of their long stay at the prisons have now developed bad habits like practicing homo-sexuality. This is not good because of the outbreaks of some diseases. So if only criminals could be rehabilitated it could be better. Really prisons are outdated.
Also a person could be sentenced to prison for something that he has not done. I mean mistakes happen and one could be accused. Imagine suffering at the prison for something you have not done? It is not good at all. At least instead of sending a person to a prison and take hiem to rehabilitation centre it could be better. Some people in the community also are afraid of the prisoners. They see them as dangerous people though they committed different crimes. I think the community different crimes. I think the community should just accept the prisoners. The community kind of underate the prisoners, or is it because of the uniforms they wear or that they are being escorted? This is not a good way of theating other people.
To conclude I would say that I strongly want the criminals to be rehabilitated. After rehabilitation it means a person is now, is being reformed and cannot do wrong again. Really prisons are outdated! Society should find an alternative of disciplining its criminals.

TSNO1425,3.0,3.5,,,,,Feminists have done more harm to the cause of women than good,"
This is quite a dodgy issue. First of all we need to understand the initial intention of feminist before concluding wether they have succeeded in their mission or not. Again we need to examine wether these feminists we males of females. It is no argument that the majority of feminists are women which gives rise to the following question:""why?""
To answer that we begin by defining feminism in lame man's terms: ""It is the kind of process or action that primarily concentrates promoting women issues, their rights as human, their desire to be recognised and respected, to be considered and accomodated in their society."" NOW for the fact that there is a need for women to be recognised, it clearly indicates that there is a lack of such. This then ushers us into examining why there is a lack of recognition for women in our societies.
If memory serves me correct, the plight of women is only but one of the most recent occurances. You should remember that it is only a couple of years ago, when South African women went to some women Empowerment conference in Beijin (sp). That caused a lot of noise, suddenly the nation leaders and civilians were flushed with mixed emotion. Some felt demascubted, some proud of the fairer species taking their stand in the global society. And then there was a commercial craze over the matter, the music industry cashed in on it. American, South African and other European music writers and produces came up with groups Like Spice Girls, Destiny's Child and the likes.
With songs like ""scrub"", ""Independent Women""' men now really started to feel intimidated. It was the very industry that first started with the retaliation, a coolision led by male musicians against the women generation. I am sure u can still remember the song ""scrub"" and Mandoza's hit single ""50/50"".
From that point, the snowball began. There is nothing more dangerous than a man who feels like less of a man. Women were in parliament, the government is on the women's side, Company's top executives are on skirts, stalkings, high heels and guess what, they wear lipstick, Yes lipstick and eye shadow. To make matters worse for the Adam generation, some Adams now wantedto be Eves. What a blow to a man's ego!!! Well, the real question here, is wether what women started with good intentions, has done them more good than harm.
I would say that at this point, it still stands an untold mystery. Consider the crimes committed against women, the unspeakable violations against the girl-child. Mental prisons created by the man-people against us women is all physical. It has nothing to do with Intelligence, Integrity or any form of Godly intentions. It is all physical, it a who is stronger than who game. Men in every society have always had an upperhand and wether we'd like to swallow it in or not, even in today's society they still do. It is a sad and heart tearing idea but it is true.
It all biols down to this communication. The message women in Beijin were trying to convey to men got misinterpreted by men, No guess who is responsible, the entertainment industry. Who said we didn't want to respect our Fathes, our Future husband, our brothers or our boyfriends? It is certainly not us. But because the message was interrupted, it never did what it was intended to do, instead, it did the opposite.
Yes! Feminists have done more harm to the cause of women than good!

TSNO1426,3.0,2.5,,,,,"Some people say that in our modern world, dominated by science and technology and industrialisation, there is no longer a place for dreaming and imagination. What is your opinion?","
It is true that our modern is filled with scince technology and industrialisation. But I tend to disagree that there is no longer a place for dreaming and imagination. Look Science and technology exists in the real world, so I don't see how can it hidder something like adream or imagination which is not for real or those not exists in the physical world.
Infact the world of Scince technology and in dustrialisation help the main concept of the dreaming and the imagining world in abig way I'll give you an example, 30 years ago people wouldn't dream of communicating globaly with their counterpart from anywhere in the world. But thanks to the dreaming of people like Bill Gates who dreamnt of one day owning his own software / Computer Company which today is possible for us to communicate via E-mail of his computers.
We can travel anywhere in the world because have airplanes thanks to some one whoinitialy had a concept in his mind that one day he want to Create an airplane in order to assist people to travel anywhere in the world. So we can say that thinking and imagining is part of Scince and techology.
They go hand in hand in order for thinks that are good for industries to be established so that we can live better as people is this world.
I mean even Cellphones, telephones they were created by people out of their imagination before they were established physically. Any were Science and technology plays an important role in our lifes I may elastrated even of electricity it is amiracle that was initially part a humans-imagination or adream of saying someday I want to establish some like that.
Imean things become more easy even for people who comes from previously disadvantaged communities, door of thinking more and more are opened for thanks to Scince and technology even ifrestructure is accessed easily unlike in previous years were by if you had a poem you would have to write on a tree or stone to keep it in record.
Now you can write it on a piece of paper or preferably type in using keyboard ofacomputer thanks to technology. You see things and dreaming is no longer just unreal thing on a humans mind but they can come real this time more easier because of the concept of Scince and technology. If want to design a Car I just draft it on my P.C. and Email / it to a certain Car manufacturer if they find it interesting then my dream has now become a visual reality and changes of me getting rich are more and doing that work of designing did not cost me a fortune thanks to Scince and technology. Even lives are being save in operating theaters because if a doctor has said to practice a certain operation but he is Germany but these skills are required here in South-Africa he can be contacted by video phone or other means of visual communication so that he may assist doctors in S.A. with out being travelling all the way from Germen all in all Science and technology is good for our every day lifes.

TSNO1428,3.0,3.0,,,,,Feminists have done more harm to the cause of women than good,"
Truly speaking, yes indeed feminists have done more harm to the cause of women in than good in our country. You get a case reported of assault everyday. I once made a research with my friend after a discussion of feminists. Immediately we went and asked why was women beaten so badly by men.
We got different answers and the most popular one was that they were not cooking and taking care of children. Rights of women, as the men said, are the once breaking the marriage, mostly these days especially at nights they forget that they have work to do, cooking and satisfying mens needs. They go out with other men while living their husbands in the house. Its not a right thing to beat a lady because she'll underestimate you as man. On the other side men are only looking for themselves, their rights. They like to exercise their rights than women.Ok women are oppressed by men in most cases.
I can say again feminist have done more harm to the cause of women than good. Sometimes men would like to have sex with wives, their wife don't feel like doing it then that's were problem start, men goes outside looking for another partner and his wife will be upset. Women have rights and men really need to take that in to consideration. The problem is, men feel like women are controlling them. Sometimes the culture, I mean the way women grew, sometimes she feels like it was rudeculous, and after marriage she finds and learn a lot about her rights, because sometimes, but always you mustn't do something that you don't like because its not going to do any good to or satisfy your feelings. Women are treated like animals and the things without them I don't think men can live without them.
Its not only that feminists have caused harm to women now; early before 1994, women were abused by men but it wasn't out like now. I think men and women should sit down together and think about their rights and what do those rights really mean and how to use freedom. Indeed rights are breaking the marriages. Women are threaghtned by men that they will divorce them if open the case against man. In most of the times women think they don't have a choice when they'll arrest their husbands because they are the only breadwinners in the house, If the husband is arrested who will support them.
As men say: the women sometimes pushes them to beat them; they will attend some occasion without telling them were they go and sometimes they'll go out with other men. Rights are really killing both women and men.
Both the other one wants this and the other one wants that thing. Maybe if will well talk to each other and try to know one another before getting into the marriage that will help us not to fight but live precious life.

TSNO1431,3.5,4.0,,,,,"Some people say that in our modern world, dominated by science and technology and industrialisation, there is no longer a place for dreaming and imagination. What is your opinion?","
I am very much for the idea that the world has been so technolized so much that there is no room for conventionalism. It is sad so see that the younger generation is so hooked onto these man-made devices, they have become dependent on modern technology such as tv. games, computers, calculators, telephones etc. to such an extend that if you asked them to perform certain tasks using basic tools they would not be able to finish those tasks.
Socially, people used to communicate by letters and word of mouth. whereas these have been replaced by telephones, computers and most recently electronic mail and cellular phones. Youngsters are now unable to utter a simple English phrase without slopping in some slang words or township lingo?s. It is my opinion that when, in the days old, people practiced languages by writting letters and so forth they improved their language skills considerably more compared to today. I believe that these inventions have spoilt the human race because we are so dependent on them we can not see ourselves doing manual things such as washing the dishes, we have to have a dishwasher to survive. This is pathetic of us, we are simply and purely becoming lazier and lazier by the day.
Educationally, when I was growing up it was my parents? duty to teach me about the world. They had time for me ? even after coming back from strenous work situations my father would sit down with me and teach me basic Arithmatic using butter beans or seeds of some fruit or sorts. When I began my Grade 1 in 1984 I could count, add, subtract and even write my name, never mind the writting of an ancient egyptian but at least I knew what letters of the alphabet constituted my name. Today?s generation need only one tool in mind, the calculator! They just punch away their little index fingers on the keys and out comes the answer. This affects them because they hardly exerase their brain cells therefore their brains become dorments. This makes it difficult for them in future because even if they knew the answer they would not how to present it because their brains have been inactive for a good part of their lives.
In the days of old kids learned by playing together in the street but today they just stare at their tv sets and instead of learning things of value, those that build character and instill good morals they watch violent cartoons which do more harm than falling while playing outside. They don?t have people who would teach by story-telling - this helped children to exercise their brains and intelligence by providing a platform for dreaming and imagine the characters in the stories told. They don?t even practice the culture of reading books for entertainment, they only read a book if its prescribed for their curriculum of when they need to research for an assignment.
One American study proved that about nine (9) out of ten (10) teenagers consume more electronic media than their counterparts ten years earlier and this proved detrimental as 60% of them ended up with offences ranging from violent outbreaks and unacceptable social behaviour some went as far as becoming juvenile deliquents. I understand, with the invention of mordernised devices, technology was meant to play a vital role in our lives, a role that would benefit the human race positively but seeing that it is doing more harm than good I think we should abolish it.
This is evident in the events of September 11, 2001 when the world remained static simply because of what happened in the U.S.A. South Africans were affected by witnessing the downfall of their currency. I believe that we should pack up all these man-made machines and go back to conventionalism. In conclusion man can no more be called the human race but the ?techno race? or ?the thumb race? as one chinese documentary puts it!

SOME PEOPLE SAY THAT IN OUR MODERN WORLD DOMINATED BY SCIENCE TECHNOLOGY AND INDUSTRIALISATION THERE IS NO LONGER A PLACE FOR DREAMING AND IMAGINATION.
I can believe with people who say that in our modern world dominated by science and technology and industrialisation there is no longer a place for dreaming and imagination, because this is what is happening in out daily lives. Now these days is seems as every-thing is now being under the technology ideas. Each and every day some scientists are trying to find some way in which they can use by means of technology. They are doing some researches, and even at some schools some students are encouraged to take some science subjects, starting from the primary level.
I think that in the late centuries there were no auto-bank machines, traffic light, Computers communication device (eg telephone lines, mobile phones radio and television) but life was good to those people who live by that time. There was a way in which they can communicate and receive information of what is going on. Now these days we have some telephones lines, mobile phones, emails, ect, is which we can stay in touch with anyone around the world. And all of these has been developed by a human being, whom we can call a scientist. By radio and television we can receive information of what is happening around as and around the world. This is by means of technology bcease the television and the radio uses siginals. These signals has been developed by some scientist.
In every day of our lives we use technology, even when we are not aware of this. When we go to the automatic bank machiens (A.T.M.) to deposit or to withdraw money, we have used our knowledge of technology to operate that machine (A.T.M.)
Some of the jobs that are advertised in some newspapers by some employees will need only you if you are computer literate. Some big industies in todays lives uses some technology to operate some of the machiens. And this means that they will not need more employers to work the because some of the work need to be done will be for done machines. It is therefore I agree with thoso people who say our modern world, is dominated by science and technology and industrialisation and there is no longer place for dreaming and imagination. I?m saying this because if you have dreamed to be in a sertain position and that position is operated by means of or technology your dreams are good for nothing.

TSNO1435,3.0,3.0,,,,,Most university degrees are theoretical and do not prepare students for the real world. They are therefore of very little value,"
There are some Universities in South Africa that do not prepare Students for the real world. When you are in an interview for example with a student from the University of Cape Town or Wits and the Student From the University of North West, The one from Wits or Cape Town is the one who is going to be appointed not because He/She is from that kind of University but because of Her/His cirtificate.
Other institutions are undermined because they are affordable and most of the Students may be Black. Some Universities are not affordable and it is believed that Schools or Universities with the Majority of Blacks doesn?t have value and it is somehow true. Because the way the lecturers, lectures us is not like the other Universities where the majority are Whites.
At the other hands all the Universities have value because each and every University have its structure and its rules. We all have to be taken in different companies not because of the University that you come from but of the experience that you have. You can have a degree from Wits University and not having any experience and the other from the UNW and that one had an experience. You are not going to be treated the same maybe it is because We, South Africans we critisize other Universities. Each and every University have Value. If it doesn?t have value why there are many students in that particular University?
We dont have to critisize other Universities because those that are critisized have the help they could give to students who are poor. You can?t get a bursary at the University of Pretoria easily especially when you are Black. But at some Universities where most of the students are black you get a bursary/loan even if You are a White\Coloured or Indian.
All the Universities have value and to motivate that its because they are all into action. The difference is that other Universities think that they are of high class and the others are of low class. And they dont take anyone and again you fail in the ?so called? high class Universities because everything is high meaning: tuition, education and books and that does?nt mean We have to think that other Universities that are affordable like the UNW doesn?t have high class education. It is a high class university and it produce brilliant students just like other institutions.
The problem is that where most of the People are White we believe that it is a high class University that is why a student from Tuks and a Student from the UNW are not treated the same, the other is critisized by the other because of the name of the University and not because of the experience and the brilliant student He\She is. Each and every University Should be recognised not because it is a university with most Blacks or Whites but because We are all equal and let our Universities be equal too.
We all have to be recognised not because of the name of the University but because you have a degree and an experience. We have to get jobs as much as other Students From other institutions. I belief that apartheid is over so let other Universities be recognised in the field of Education, as much as Wits, Tuks and the other high class Universities are recognised.

TSNO1438,2.5,3.5,,,,,Feminists have done more harm to the cause of women than good,"
Yes, I agree with that because during these years some women are being raped only because of men will only want them to prove that really there is a gender equality between them. So women will be able to fight back to have self diffence against them.
The second point is that women are suffering as men are now too much relaxed because they know that women will always be there for them no matter the consequences because I believe that it started many years during ancestors?s ancestors when women where given the heart of gold by our creator.
From the above point women are looking after household and children and at the same time they are work to bring or put food on the table while men are only relaxing. Ok it has to be that way when coming to children but menalso have to look after them and they should wake up and smell the coffee.
As a women I think that there should be a fifty-fifty chance, where both should participate in every case. If a women is at work also a man should be out there digging for the food or working infact men are not suppoised to be relaxing at all because in the family we know that men are the head in the house, so it would not be a proper family without the head of the family simply meaning that it is not possible for a body to be called a body without the head or any of the parts of the body. Therefore both man and women should, its a must to have a successful family so that children can be brought up properly without unnecessary problems.
In terms of work women are not been given a good chance a much chance as to show their carpebility of how the can perform in work places or they are not been given much opportunities.
So my conclusion is that both women and men should work together to make South Africa a better place and a place to be proud of, because if we can look at the other side of criminality, it is because men are just relaxing and want other people to work for them in other words they just want to wake up, eat, be with friends, drink and to be mouth feeded with everything.
Looking at people who are stealing and commiting crime. It is because that they do not have money to buy their own things so they are stealing from people who were working so hard to put food on their tables.
So men lets stop this abuse and wake up and smell the coffee. Years are gone by we can not turn back the hands of time but we can make it better in future. So let us all say VIVA to South Africa and pray to God so that He can help us to make this place a better place.

As the topic has already stipulated the situations in tertiary intitution, I believe and agree with it. The fact is these tutors of the universities are lazy and dont seem to be interested on educating but being on the higher rank and to be called ?sir? or ?lecturer? is what they enjoy most.
When comming to this point of lazyness many lecturers sit down in their offices during their lecture period ignoring us on the other hand that we want to be taught and go further more than they did. May be they thought we came with our blankets to stay for a lifetime. They should wake up and do their work. The next thing when he or she come to class he will just keep on telling us about a whole 45 minutes period and leave us in hollow deep and dark hole.
The goverment might have done stupid thing about this thing OBE (out based education) system. I am saying this because teachers do not teach and lecturers do not lecture they just give instructions to children or learners and as I?ve said leave leaners uninformed having no idea of what he has been told.
When the learner complains about his incapability of understanding he or she will be told about this OBE that he must work everything on his or her own because the rules of this OBE say teachers will do 10 percent of the work and learners will do 90 percent of it which means leaners will have to stress themselves about OBE to be succesfull.
The other fact why I am considering the goverment to have done a stupid thing is that OBE have been tried in one of the most known developed countrie USA and it does failed. So are underdeveloped Africans whom are we trying to imitate and where are to be with this.
OBE is something of a little value and it will lead us to a point whereby our African Educators would be of a little value too. So to solve the matters let us get rid of this thing because it did not work in America. It again affect the way we live because there is no enough communication between a learner and the educator so it decrease our english language skills. What I am trying to say is how can one express and show what he have been tought while he has?nt get the information about what he has been taught.

Basically I agree with the above mentioned topic that universities are too theoretical unlike technikons. Not discriminating universities I think technikons are better than universities cause at the university 80% of it is theory and 20% practical. At technikons I think its 70% practical and 30% theory. As a matter of fact most people are unemployed but holding degrees on their hands. This is because they?ve got degrees without experiences.
Eventually at least some people who has diplomas without degrees has experience more than those with degrees. Statistics show that the percentage of unemployed people are those from universities. Its not fair because the universities fees is higher than that of technikons. I?m sorry to say this but It was?nt my intention to be in a university, I?m here cause I was desperate.
Some people think that if you?ve got a degree you?re better than a person with a diploma. That?s not true. Talking from experience, I?ve got a sister with degrees, she was attending at a university. She is unemployed and there?s no company wishing to hire her. It is Painful, you think about your money and time you?ve wasted maybe for three years. Universities should be improved, if not so, it won?t get students.
This is high time there musn?t be a person unemployed but one is from school. According to my opinion people who should be unemployed are those who haven?t gone to school and those who ended in grade 12.
Most of university students don?t have a brighter future. It must end this thing of theory. We can?t tolerate our futures to be under pressure or rather dull. When you?re seeking a job, they expect you to have experience, so what if you don?t have experience? It?s too bad, what are you going to do without experience.
I don?t see why there?s no enough practical in a university. We can?t work with theory, we should apply theories in practical. I can say its time wasting learning for the whole 3 years whereas you?re not going to use what you?ve learnt. If universities can introduce more practical than theory, we?re all going to have a brighter living. We need equall Education at tertiary level.
If we observe clearly, in our country most unemployed are the Blacks. Most of Whites children they?re employed and sometimes its because they?re not ignorant and their fathers own companies, Businesses and so on. One thing for sure is that Blacks are ignorant too much, its not a secret or racism. I?m black but I include myself in that ignorance. So if blacks should leave their ignorance they can be successful in everything like the whites. I respect a white man, leaving apartheid aside. White people use their brains and historical background. They don?t forget where are they from unlike us.

Gender equality is what we aim to do, there will be no sexism. This is what feminists preach on a daily basis, but they never practice what they preach. Little or no change has been done.
A lot of women have been given bad treatment, and treated unfairly because of who they are. If you?re strong willed, and ambitious that is when people try by all means to bring you do. Gone are the days when men were regarded as the heads of houses. Gone are the days when this world was regarded as a ?man world?. If a woman makes it to the top, in this day in age, people still say they ?slept their way to the top?. If you?re a woman and have a high position, the men below you feel they don?t have to answer to you. As far as I?m concerned people who still think that way, have absolutely nothing going for them. They?re also disgustingly ignorant and narrow minded.
I?m not saying women should be given more power over men. All I?m saying is gender equality is what most women what. I don?t think you should be treated badly because of your gender, because you?re regarded as the weaker sex. People should learn to realise your values, your personality, they should look past your skirt. They should take time to analyse who you are, what you?re offering and why you?re really there.
Instead of being treated equally, they?re treated harshly. Because even today people are still living in the stone age, its sad but its true. I think the whole situation has gone worse. The more equality is preached, the more things deteriorate.
Something as brutal and ?spine-chilling? as rape still exists. Do you know why?, because women are regarded as weak, and the men as strong. Weak in this case because she couldn?t fight back, weak because she actually got raped. I?m not generalising, but unfortunately some people?s brains are pea-sized. So this is how they still think. Some women?s ego?s have been bruised and battered, their self esteem gone down the drain. Because subconsciouly this what they believe, that men will always be in control. That is why even today, for some women to actually make a decision they have to get the go ahead from their partners.
Some tswana cultures are to blame, to a certain extent. In some tswana cultures, you are by no means supposed to ask your husband. Where he?s been its rude, not to mention disrespectful. As well as when he verbally abuses you, you?re meant to keep quiet. Things like that were probably considered in the olden age. They shouldn?t still be considered today. Becauseb I?d like to think things have changed since those days. Or rather things should change, because if they don?t change...Then we shouldn?t ask for equality, and a better world.

TSNO1455,3.0,,,,,,Most university degrees are theoretical and do not prepare students for the real world. They are therefore of very little value,"
It is a fact that most degree are more theoretical than practical in universities. Students are just taught without being given the practice that they deserve. Today, in most cases, Students, after graduating from universities, they just sit with their certificates without being appointed for any post because of not having the relevant experience. Most of the time, in fact every time, experience is always required in job advertisements. If you have never done the course practically, yes you can be appointed, but of course you won?t get or be payed the actual salary because of the shortage of your course, practicalwise.
Often, students get distinctions in their courses (theoretical courses), and in this case, a lecturer will be impressed with the marks of these students. If you analyse this, it will come to a point were you realize that a student knew something about the course for the mean ? time he or she was writing his or her examinations, but after that what was read just get wiped away. So, it would be different if courses were done also in a practical way, one would get to know and understand what is to be done or what is done and still remember that in years to come. If you learn using your hands, For instance, touching and Feeling, experimenting, observing, comparing and even predicting it is not possible For one to Forget a certain thing easily but instead, such information would be stored in a long-term memory, so once you try to retrieve information stored, years to come, surely you will rember even if it you won?t have a clear picture but surely, again, you will be able to pick up bits and piesces of what you once stored, even when you work because you will need to remember some of the things you once studied. So, if you did the course practically (also) you would remember it won?t be necessary for one to go back and consult his or her books.
Practicals would reward everyone from either sides, the employee in this case and employer. Employers won?t need to send their new employees to time and again workshops, and in this case the company will be saving a lot more because at times you have to consider such things. If one is being employed with the knowledge of theory only, that particular person would definitely need to be workshoped at the expense of the company in order for him or her to know clearly what is expected in reward.

Most of students when the leave the university they seem not to know what to do when they are exposed to job situation. In most cases one will find that much time is spent on re-training them trying to equip them with relevant skills for whatever job they are to take as a career. Supervisors and other concerned parties are forced to leave their day to day activities to come to the rescue of the poor graduate who meets bottlenecks in practical exercise.
When people or colleagues find that a graduate is posted to their institution, they fill very happy and proud thinking that they are going to gain a lot from him because he would come with new ideas since he is fresh from a higher institution. Only to find that the person is vague, unskilled and expecting more from them, there is no exchange of knowledge since he knows close to nothing. He cannot perform any duty allocated to him by himself he needs close supervision which makes other people leaving their work to suffer and help the poor fellow.
Sometimes it takes time for the person to cope with the work situation, he needs time or even workshops to assist him. There would be a problem if one is posted to an istitution where members of the staff are not collaborative, they would leave him to suffer saying that let us see what he is going to do because he poccesses a degree. The graduate would feel that he is incompetent and decides to run away from his career because the university did not equip him with real work situation but theory.
Some fields such as agriculture, nursing, teaching etc need a lot of practical skills time and again during studying period at the university. Students should be taken to their relevant fields to be exposed to the work not just to be stuffed with assignments that do not do them any good at the end of the day. Expose them to the patients that they are going to nurse, to the students/learners that they are going to educate to the farms that they are going to work on.
So all in all we can say that the university is doing only 50% of the work (theory) and leave the other 50% (practical) for people in the field to finish it which is time consuming and delays productivity.

TSNO1461,2.5,3.0,,,,,Most university degrees are theoretical and do not prepare students for the real world. They are therefore of very little value,"
I agree with the topic, that most university much theory, and of which it is good to do theory. But I think that much practical is need and not much theory. Practical is more important that you can see or realize how much you are able to do the job. For example, I am doing communication programme and broadcast is my first choice or major. What I think is when you do let say, radio even t.v., you need more practise, so if you do only theory, how can you know that you are able to become a radio Dj or tv. Presenter, because the best way is if you do it practical, see yourself behind the mic or behind the camera to see you are not camera shy.
This thing of theory only, wasted money people's time because they were good theoretically but practically poor and a company employs the one who have abilities to do the job and not only who learned about it, but it happens most cases. That is why in South Africa we have many unemployed but qualified people who obtained their degrees at universities.
If there sould be 50/50, fifty percent theoretical and fifty percent practical and that can help, because people can learn about the job and can learn to do it properly by practising it. For example if you do broadcast and like to specialize with radio like me, its going to be tough, because there's time, if I want to start my job, then I cannot be able to operate machines, mixers and so forth. Now that means I'm going to need some practise of which I could have done during my studies at university.
Theory is needed, its okay, but more practice. Theory can for example in communication indoctrinate you how to communicate with your viewers when you're radio personality or tv talkshow hoster, but cannot show or prove how able you are to do a certain job.
I think something must be done with this strategy or procedures in university.
Some other programmes in universities are doing theory and practical equal for example nursing, they are doing more practise of which is needed. So the question is what about other programmes, why radio machines, tv cameras are not installed? Those are the equipments that should be used to see the abilities of a person. Why do they think for only nurses and sciences people, are this equipments of other programmes expensive? I think that is an excuse because they introduced a programme to the university, so let them deal with everything that comes. Some other technikon campus, even those campus that are not doing communication, have campus radio. That's where you can see your skills and follow your dreams, and leave things that you can't behind.
So I think the department and the government should or must do something about this thing of more practical to be introduced in the universities, for our and their benefits.

Three years of one's life is spent reading reading and reading, if one is at a university. Where is the fun in it if all you do is read and don't get practical?
Other people may say that it is precise. True. But the only time you get to experience what you have been reading about is only when you have completed your studies, and some degrees take four years to complete even five if necessary. An example would be the LLB degree. It has a four-year curriculum and a five-year curriculum, and do believe me when I say after you complete your degree, you still have to go to a law school in order to be considered ""qualified"". But that does not guarantee you a job, you still have to hunt it down. How are companies going to recognise your capability if they do not know about you? That is what I think practically tries to emphasise, ""your capability"".
I consider university theory sacrete. I mean, whether you pass with distinctions and understand your studies very well, who knows about it hah? Only when you have completed your degree may you be considered to be ""semi-qualified"". Why ""Semi""? Because experience plays a major role in one's ability to get a job. So if you don't have experience, people might as well refer to you as an ""amateur"". One would just crack thinking of the hell one went through, all those sleepless nights, trying to get it right.
Another thing about universities is that the cost a fortune! Some may say it is a challenge that one faces to study hard and get distinctions so that one can receive a bursary. Also true. But what happens then to a B-aggregate student hah?! The only way one can get a bursary is when one gets more than three distinctions. And what do we call this ""psychologically""? We call it pressure!
Just because some students manage getting more than three distinctions does not mean ""One can, all can"" As individuals, we are all different. That is why we are reffered to as individuals. We all have our ways of doing, observing and understanding things and those ways aren't all the same. That is why we also have another concept called ""perspective"" which is defined as one's mental window through which one looks at reality. That's also why our population groups are divided into two groups, the other being rich ant the other being poor. This shows that not everyone does the same things, have the same things and has the same things.
In conclusion I want to say, students should be given an opportunity to explore you know, get practical. This will serve as another way of making it in life for students, especially those who cannot afford tuition fees. At least being practical and studying has a point. This point being that one gets more educated and becomes more better at what one does. Eventually all this leads to every worker's favourite word, ""a raise"".
There is a difference between knowing and understanding. When you know, is when you have seen or read something. But understanding is a whole new different concept. Understanding entails experience. That is what learning is all about, learning and understanding and in my opinion, universities contradict what I have just said. Afterall, how does one know something if they haven't really understood it???

According to me some degrees of the university are theoritical and are not prepare students for the real world. Some peole finished their degrees and did not get the job and they stay at home without money and employment whereas they spended many years in universities.
Many now are working at mines under the ground because of the cources that are futile that they learn from universities. Many are criminals because they finished their degrees in universities and no jobs which are suitable for them to live. Othey are imprison because they tried to get food by the wrong method.
Other degrees of university are theoretical if you take them you deleyed your time because no money for that degree and no job. You do some degrees and you going to look like you finished your school at standard seven. My cousin was doing communication for three years now he works in Impala where he dig Platinum like the person who did not attend any university. He earn like a Person who didn't Finished his degrees in university or finished matric.
Some degrees of university are not good for people to improve their standard of living because to do degree in university you wanted to earn high salaries, and to get luxurious job. Not to dig Gold or Platinum in Mines. Some degrees are nice like nursing, Animal Health and Law because when you Finished it you get the job. And you are going to be appeased by your salaries. You can earn five thousands upwards. Because the more you learn the better salaries you will get. The only Problem of unemployment even if you finished your degree in university is that favouritism, corruption in South Africa is high. Even if in Parliament Corruption Plays important role. Other problem of the degree or university is that at some of the degrees are done by many people and Job for that degree became lack because many people work for that degree. Problem can be solved if the universities limit the number of people which can be employed for the same year. Eg Broadcasting wanted 70 people so every year and university must take only 70 people of Broatcasting per year.
The reason for other degrees that are important is that there is fewer people who attended that course for example animal Health is not attended by many People, because it work with cows and many people afraid cows. AnimalHealth is attended by many People which come from Rural areas because they used to look after the animals.
According to me our government must try to help those people who came from different universities with jobs because they spend more money for that degrees Government must help them with jobs.

Most of the University degrees are theoretical and do not prepare students for the real world / their new working place where they will be employed. University is different from the colleges and Technikon because they offer a practicals on their second and last year.
Times have changed its unlike the past years where you will be asked for a  qualification and be employed. Today the situation is different the government and most of the private sectors require a practical experience and of at least 2 to five years. Think of all the hard time's you go through and the  you lose, after all the hard work for four to five years at you institution then you graduate. After all the hard work of educating you self then you go and look for a job, when you get there they ask if you have  experience of you Qualification.
During the segregation era people where encouraged to go to School now people have the education but they are not employed. Its even worse for the university students - because they have no practical experience even their refferences can not recommend them for a working experience, unlike Technikon Students. That is why people say universities are therefore of very little value for today's life time.
It's about time all the universities starts to consider this problem or the department of education, who ever is in charge must make sure that all university starts benefiting the students. Our government says its working towards a better life for all, if thats the case they should starts with the unemployment issue first because most of our brothers and sisters are educated but their at home and I am affraid that we might fall in the same trap.
I am very concerned about the problem because it might affect some of us. The government and the private sectors must stop asking for the experience that we don't have. How can you have a working experience when you have not worked before are still fresh from the university. I Think they are the ones that have to come up with a solution to the problem e.g. when they have vacant post's they should go to the different institutions and look for student who are busy with their last year and appoint them for different positions in different departments of the government.
If these issues are to be considered the problem can decrease with a high rate and some of the students can be motivated to work hard so that they can also get a chance to be short listed for the vacant post in certain companies or at different departments of the government.

In our world especially in our country there are only few industries out there for people who don't have knowledge about Science or who never did science and maths during their high school days. There are more people who have graduated from technikons & University and most of them are unemployed. Their dreams have been shattered due to lack of knowledge about Science & technology.
When we are growing up, we had dreams about being succesful having a secure job, being financialy independent from our parents and our spouses. We all dreamt of everything we could possibly think of. Most of us who are employed are not really satisfied with our jobs, we only work for the sake of putting food on the table, clothing and even for shelter because somehow we have to make a living.
There are lot of educated people out there who will do any job they can find even if they are over qualified for. When they apply for jobs, they might be told they are over qualified for that kind of job they have applied for or they don't have any experience because they just came out of tertiary institutions. These are the kind of people who should be concidered first. People at higher places should know that there is no school for experience, How will they have experience when they are not given a chance.
Most people who had jobs in industries have lost their jobs due to the fact that those industries have implemented machines which can do a man's job. Anyway by most people I was  about the mine workers. We should all be given a chance especialy those who are qualified, no matter on what field. The goverment should stop focusing on themselves & their families. People voted for them to be where they are so that they can fight the battle for us.
Every time the goverment introduce something new or advertising job posts, they are focusing on those who did Maths and Science in highschools and University. They forgot about others who have non of those subjects. They shouldn't forget that we are not the same and we are from different backgrounds. So next time they should start their posts on general assistant for those who never got a chance to go to school. That is why there are lot of crimes out there because people don't have jobs.

In South Africa we're got lot of universities e.g. Unisa, Wits-university, University of Cape Town and Uniwest. Most of these universities they offer hundred percent (100%) theory and some offer only fifty to sixty (50 - 60%).
Things being like that it  to be a problem when coming to others side, because we believe in different stories, some believe in theory some in practical and some in both theory and practical.
Theory is very dangerous because it doesn't explore you to the external life and it makes you stereotype and also it is unhealthy to believe in theory only because in most of your times you consider only books / you concentrate only on the books without practical or sort like type refreshment by means of Practicals.
Our University (unw) is one of the Universities that offers only theory which can be estimated to about (99.1%), the Question is how can some of us cope which such an institution. Yes I agree with the fact that it was politically affected but for now it is no longer affected what caused me to say that is that some of the Universities e.g. University of witwatersrand they offer engineering subject e.g. Mining and others. They offer computer courses e.g. computer science, and others, which are mostly based on Practical such universities serves up to (45%) theory and 55% practical.
Such universities are useful because they explore a student to the ouside world and it becames easier for a student to cope with a situation. Whites believes in practical because they understand how important the practical is, that is why in most of the times you find most of them in the technikons or in the Universities that offers Practical, thereafter someone will come to you and tells you about Political Inffection.
Our University can pick up its standard if such coarses could be introduced and on top of that, if our management could be improved because the problem is on it. I dont know whether they are impressed to see the blacks dominating and the standard busy falling or what. If our management is rules and dominated by blacks this clearly means that students are all going to be black. We are tired to see a university that looks like a rural Primary school. we are not going to allow it.
Practicals does not mean mines should be invented in our institution or factories or what, but it can again be implied by exposing student to the outward world at least students must be taken to some  whereby everyone of us would like to see him/herself in future e.g. communications students must be exposed to the world of communication e.g. Broadcasting centres, Public relations office expositing at least twice a term, law student to their different  to get familiar to different matters that usually  due work
It will be very important to them because that's Part of encouragement that will encourage them in their future work. Not at the universities are of a little value only few of them but if some of the above mentioned aspects could be considered it can try to equalize the standards of the universities and technikons and try to improve the standard of the Universities against the technikons for it to remain the higher learning level too reel.

TSNO1488,3.0,2.0,,,,,Feminists have done more harm to the cause of women than good,"
In the time past women were oppressed by men in many ways than one. They could not be independent or even express themselves because everything or situations back then did not allow them. But now since we are living in a global world things are changing. Men did not allow women to be who they wished to be because it was  that a woman's place is in the kitchen. So men generally were there main culprits as far as feminism is concerned. Even in places like a church, women were nor allowed to occypy leadership positions by men.
Today things have changed dramatically after the democratic changes in South Africa even in the World. But in Some Countries feminism is also a problem. In Communists or totaliterian countries women are still oppressed, in a way their talents are wasted. These led to women to unite against their governments.
In South Africa, during the apartheid regime women were oppressed by the government even in their communities. Bur they played a  role in gaining their freedom and for their rights to be recognised. Culturally and traditionally women were oppressed by their husbands and the chiefs. It was a widespread problem for them. But they continued to fight for their independence and for to be treated as equals in the society.
After democratic elections in South Africa things changed. Women fought for their rights. In democratic countries or civilised societies women are treated as equals. Their independence helped them not to be treated as an inferior beings to men.
Unfortionately these independent women are misintepretting equality and independence as freedom. Some women feminist are out to prove a point that they can do things on their own. They don't care who gets hurt along the way. This is causing problems in the society or in many homes. Many families are broken or destroyed because women (feminists) cannot obey their husbands or atleast be mothers in their homes. They still want to exercise their new pound power over their husbands or families. So this is doing more harm than good to them because nobody wants to be with them let alone marrying them.
In Civilised societies, feminism is practiced by both men and women. We are now doing in an upnormal society because of these . Some women feminists are going for revenge against men or those who took away their independence for so long. Some spend the rest of their lives unmarried because nobody wants to be with them. Men choose to be with the less educated, rural women than with those who have many degrees / or more educated. They are bringing hot coals over themselves because of their egos. Education or  big companies by these women is causing problems for them. They are materialist.
The heartbreaking issue is that of their kids. They grow up without father figures to look up to. They want to have control over everything. They are unable to distinguise their role as women in their homes as in the society. This is a problem not only for them but also for those who are close to them.
I believe women should be given a free role in the governance of the country and in their homes. But they should always remember that they are women. They need men to make things  for all concerned. Oppression over women is not good at all. Women's rights should not be violated. They are of course the weaker sex but they have rights and they should be respected by every body. Life is becoming unbearable because of feminism. It is doing more harm to men and women than good. We should respect each others rights. God created men and women to live together. We need each other to complement and fulfil each others abilities.

It is true that after finishing matric, many student will like to fether their studies at different universities of their choice. They know which couses they are going to study and why. It is not all the student who get that chance of going to universities because an examtion pass at high school level is a key to study at university.
Some universities will allow students to write the preadmission test to study in that university. After writing this test it will be the universitys choice to choose which students can study and some student will be allowed to register for certain causes which may not be their choices.
Acording to the topic and what I've menshined above it is true that most university do not prepare students for the real world. If a student is allowed to register for the certain couse by the university, how is he going to face the world or will he be able to come pass that couse? Pre-admission test are good to some student but the university need to be carefull that they are not giving some student couses which are not their choices.
Most university degrees like education, Nursing,   and Hotel management are of very little value. I think education should be chancelled by some universities because many students have degrees in education and they are not working.
There are many nurses all over our country, some of them are not working and some are working but they don't get full payment and some are just helping those who are sick and in need of care. To study fassion  is just a waste of time because some people can make fassion without going to school or university.
Many student have studied causes like hotel management because the university allowed them to study it. There are us many hotels in our country because some of them have all the workers that they need. That is why many of those who studied hotel management don't know what to do.
Some of the student studied this causes knowing that they are of little value and just because they want to achieve something in life. Some are still blayming the universities because this causes were not their choices.
This degrees can't prepare students for the real world so there is no need for them to be studied. I think universities are awere so they must chansell them and come up with those of good value.

My opinion concerning the say that in Our modern world, dominated by science technology and industrialisation, there is no longer a place for dreaming and imagination, is now of less supportive.
If you take a good look at the advanced technology now in Our country, you'll see that it's totally losing a meaning to life. The way I see it in about 10 years in South Africa we will even be afraid to go to Town on our own. The new introduced Internet banking only accomodate people who are able to afford computers. What about the people in the rural villages or areas? Technology may think that it's easing things for people but the fact is, it makes people to lose their roots.
In de olden days we would visit family friends whenever we wanted to convey urgent messages, bur now even a message that is so hard to be transmitted, people are not ashamed to send an e-mail or sms telling the bad news. How absurb that is! We used to have dreams, imagination, be creative but all or a sudden our hopes and dreams are shattred right before our eyes.
In Our country we've got many talented artist Out there but because for one to really expose one's talent, one has to go to Jo'burg where technology is more advanced. Jo'burg the so called ""real world"", quite to the contrary it's the place where no-one feels safe alone in de house. You can't even answer your phone  people. Criminals could rob you money, cellphone, or hijack you, my dear God! Without anyone helping. I wonder if that's how the adcanced technology wants to achieved, hatred among children of God.
Atleast in a place like Mafikeng people can still socialise and help each other even if they don't know each other's 1st names. The Internet banking will create scarcity of people meeting at malls, Towns or Megacity. Meeting of people  love, wanting to know others more. At times you meet your long last friend and you can  even have lunch together. So imagine what computer is doing to us now, In years to come we will not see any importancy of going to Town. You can shop, bank, buy airtime vouchers or anything that your heart desires from the internet.
If you are avoiding to see your loved ones you will consoule yourself that atleast you hear their voices everyday or you will see their faces on computer while chatting with them. You will see no necessity to visit your grandparents that you used to visit every holidays in your childhood. You will not attend wedding, birthdays or family gathering because you know you'll see the whole event in the video recorder it will be as if you were there.
In the industry our people are not given chances to explore their talents. Whenever there's an audition, the producers know already who they want i.e other celebrities. The way I see it there is no longer a place for our dreams and imaginations to come true, because of science technology and industrialisation. If God could ask me now, what do I prefer between the modern world and primitive world, I would choose olden days atleast the generation of that time lived longer a century and more, that's one of the advantages.
One of the disadvantages of technology is that people fall in love with Internet partners you know nothing about, people know how how to create bombs, like those school kids in Carlifornia.
Oh God only you can help us because You gave us talents, dreams, emotions everything to make us be creative and imaginative and the new advanced technology and industrialisation's aim impact real aim is to end the world that God has beautifully and patiently created.
The way I see it the world is at the brink of it's Catastrophe that is where the new advanced technology and industrialisation is leading us to! The point of Death.

My OPINION ABOUT The DOMINATED WORLD
I do agree with the people that are saying there is no longer a place of dreaming and imagination. Technology is more advanced than ever. The scientists are doing their best to advance everything. We can no longer imagine things like we used to. The scientists are doing a great job advancing things. Way back we used Dream of many things that we wanted to know and see.
The scientists brought us up to the light. We now know more things than we used to. They have invented many things that are interesting for example cellphones, you can talk to someone who is very far.
A person can come from Zambia only to learn about some thing in South Africa. Our scientist have invented many things that are miraculous. We are now having cameras all around towns. And some of the people are not aware of them especially those from Rural areas.
Our world is more advanced but most people don't know anything about the changes that are taking place in urban areas and big towns like capetown, Durban especially Johannesburg. Because of that many people move to Johannesburg only to learn those changes that are taking place around town.
I think the scientists should atlist try to bring the changes every where. So that they will fit us all. I don't think that what their doing is wrong, but they should accommodate all the people around the world. The generation that is in the world now is experiencing more technological changes.
The coming Generation will be living in the world where everything is possible. They will be sitting at home and learning to lecture teaching from school. Computes are invented and everybody is using internet from all over the world since every thing is possible through it.
We can now shop from the internet, we can even talk to our loved one's seeing that there is no need to ride into your car and pay a visit to them. You send them love messages you even tell them how u miss them in the internet.
People no longer see the need to go to town. They do everything through internet. Everybody just sit back and relax, connect to the internet and do their things. As long as you have cash in the bank you are connected. U can even bank through internet purchase airtime, clothes, food everything that you need and that is because of the science technology that is growing so fast. It is good but it is toring people apart, it is separating people from those whom they love. Technology should be brough up even to the people who are living in rural areas so that they should also be on the light.

My opinion about this topic is that there is no way in this world, where dreaming and imagination can not take place my opinion is that for any thing to take place some one some-where has to dream and imagine.
For any thing in life, be it be something that involves knowledge or thinking hand manipulating dreaming and imagining Will first be the baby of the time. Most of this technology taking place come out of man's brain work. This shows how the art of bringing this involves a lot of work that bring about solid dreaming. In most cases people do event a number things which involves a lot of thinking and when their dreams are real, after putting products in the market, they do look at how it works or oparate and then decide to make improvement so that the product is liked by the consumer. Oh! Yes, it will be very clear that there should be a dreamer to make products sell or run into the market very fast.
If there would be no dreaming there would be very little to enjoy in this world. Lets take a look at how most people benefit out of the whole world today techonology is controlling Universe, people fly in the air every day, the computers celephones fax machines all of these things give great evidence that dreams take place and they are honour by the end users.
Roads building etc are there also to give much evidence that some one must bringing art that involves much manual which some times has been put first in paper and some-one will read the dream and imagination of an individual.
The muscians who make us in joy their art of singing would not just take the instruments and sing and play them with out a preparation that comes as a dream. The people who talented in the art of writing books it is important that they are some time make their dreams about some thing worries them and put it in writing after making a dream.
Those who involved with the science, making medicine they cant do that with out bring their dreams became a reality.
There is no doubt that the whole world will depend much on people dream as sign of displaying their art. In my own thinking dreaming and imagination will ever prove to be very important from each day of our lifes for life to be enjoyed.

TSNO1504,2.5,,,,,,South African soccer players should be paid more to ensure that they play in South Africa,"
South African soccer players should be paid more to ensure that they play in South Africa.
Soccer is one of the best and loved sports by citizens of South Africa. A country can invests more on soccer and the citizens also can improve their way of living. In this essay I am going to elaborate on the importance of soccer and how it changes one's life to a unique life.
Most of the South Africans love soccer and they are using it in order to gain a better living. The director of soccer has to make show that they put a price, a very reasonable price, to those who are playing soccer to enjoy their benefits of their sweat, by so doing this will encourage those little boys to put more effort in playing soccer knowing that at the end they will be rewarded.
Since south Africans have some good players like Lucas Radebe, Benni and the rest, The country has to improve the good qualities by increasing their salary. Radebe is in united states and he is being Paik in US dollars, if the country need him to play for their soccer, they have to increase the salary, the reason being that that person cannot waste his time to come and play in south africa without being given a lot of income. People have to know that life is too short and some one has to play his cards right. It does not matter whether that player is a South African or not, the fact is that when he was training he used his skills and knowledge to train even harder.
The other thing that the South Africans have to look at it, is that when a player move from South Africa to other country he/she signs a contract. It is going to be difficult to a person to miss a practice and go back to his homeland. That person take a plane and usually the SouthAfrican cannot afford to.
The prison system is outdated, society should not punish its criminals, but rehabilitate them
The prison is a place where criminals are being given a proper way of disciplinary, and some walk out from that place being Christians, crafts men and tailors.
The prison system is not outdated it is a good system, remember that someone have committed crime  murdering, stealing etc So he or she had caused pain to that society he or she has to be severely punished. The prisoner offer them plenty of work and give them food.
The rehabilitation can not work in some of professional killers, thieves because it is in that blood. Again rehabilation will require a lot of money from the government and also from the relatives of that client. Those people who are also trained for the rehabilitation programes are also required unlike the prisoner officers who are just there.
Those murder have to be given a proper punishment that will make the loose the kind of behaviour that they have, and as some of them do kill because they cannot find employment, they are taught how to kneat, arts, painting and all these crafts that they made are sold to the public. By doing so some when released from jail they continue doing that kind of job

South-African players should be paid more to ensure that the play in South-Africa.
For the past few generations sports have been taken as a leasure activity. People only got involved in sports activities when they knock at from their workplaces. However there has been an improvements in sports that gained it recognition internationally. That means the government, companies, other organisation and indiveduals began to see sport as an investment. The injection of money in the sport arena made even more of a business that just a refreshing activity.
Nowdays every able person who has intrest in sport activity does not only contribute playing to entertain but put more effert as sports activities are business. South-African soccer is dominating all sport activities in the country in terms of support, cash injection to the economy. To my opinion south-African soccer players enjoy playing at home more than going abroad. They enjoy the environments they are used to as the can see parents relatives and friends much as they can possible do. It is easy for them to learn more tactics,  as they take advantage of the language, climate and other collsural difference they may come across when they play outside. Players talent can easly be identified when play in local teams which is an advantage as they can easly locate from one team to the other at low cost.
Inspite of all the positives I can recognise about local based play there are disadvantages. The main disadvantages being our payments they receive us local teams. Local teams do not pay enough to maintain or keep the talent local. It there means that players move from South-Africa to seek for greener pastures outside the country. They move as far as European countries where they provide services in exchange of better dollars. In most cases players enjoy staying much more where they are based thus means they invest the money there, their  used there and they eventually come back with nothing left to serve the nation.
However I cannot disagree that players aquire more skills outside which broaden their talent and make them even more valuable. But on the other hand we should not that they aquire European style of football which is different from African football, and they cannot make use of the style while they are back home. I believe there is a South-African style of football which can be modified and become one of the best in the world. The only way or the best alternative to achieve this is by keeping talent at home, brew it and let the consumers enjoy the benefit. This could be attained paying players more money to get attracted to local football. They can sometimes be loaned to some outside club to learn different styles of football to improve here and there. It is importants that local  should believe in local soccer for the benefit of the entire community.

TSNO1513,3.5,,,,,,The prison system is outdated. No civilized society should punish its criminals: it should rehabilitate them,"
The reason why there is prison is because it must rehabilitate criminal, so that they become good people. Punishing people will not bring out the best in people, but it depepends on what kind of punishment is it. There is positive and Negative punishment.
Criminals are human like everybody else, they do mistakes, so does everybody. I think if they are punished negatively, that punishment will end up filling this criminals with rage. They will want vengeance on the community. This won't do anything good, because this criminals will always commit crime as a way of punishing the community. This will result in a situation where both the community and criminals try to punish each other. They will be traped in a vicious circle. This negative punishment wont take our community anywhere. By the way, by negative punishment I mean things like, mob justise, Police assaulting prisoners and being attacked verbaly. This things will only make our criminals angry, even if they were willing to change they won't because they way they are treated will Somehow kill their sense of worth.
If prisoners are being punised positively, it might bring out the best in them. By positive punishment I am talking about tusks that will make them feel like they are important or they are worth Something. Those tasks can be Planting vegetable, helping in Community projects, Doing Gardens on government's offices. This are ways of punishment, but they are not harsh punishments. This types of punishments will instill Some Sense of importance in this prisoners. This will help in rehabilitating this Criminals, even though it won't rehabilitate them Completly, it will do something. We musn't forget that the purpose of prison is to rehabilitate prisoners not to punishment.
Lastly, Prisoners need professional help from the experts. This experts can be psychologists and social workers. As I have said before that prisoners are only human like everybody, they need councelling if they go wrong. Frequent visits from the Psychologists and Social workers will help them through the process of rehabilitation. This way our prisoners will feel that they are important. They will get the courage to go and discourage young people from commiting crimes, because there are children who look to prisoners as their role model. By rehabilitating prisoners might help the society somehow. That is why I feel that he society should not puish but rehabilitate criminals.

TSNO1515,3.5,3.0,,,,,The prison system is outdated. No civilized society should punish its criminals: it should rehabilitate them,"
The process of prison systems in the past was meant to remove dangerous criminals from the society, and to punish them for the specific crimes they have committed. These days the prison system is outdated and it has reached a stage where it is unnecessary for the criminals to be send to prison.
Some people are sometime innocently taken to prison because of various aspects. These preciding officers always cause these problems. Botched investigation are one of the aspects which take innocent people to prison but leaving the dangerous criminal roaming in our streets. Inarticulate major premise from the judicial officers can also send innocent people to prison. This is not correct to Benthams theory in history of criminology. His notion was that crimes deserve punishment fixed in proportion to the harm which has been done and it entails that a crime has its specific punishment.
The prison systems bring a very big insult to the social culture. In prisons a lot of people are influenced by those bringing bad habits within the prison walls and this can give birth to prison gangsters. These prisoners will be realesed on day into the community, and they will be pretending to be heroes to the naive youngsters who will coppy their behaviour, and end up being juveniles.
The prison system is somehow contravining with some of the human rights, these are conjugal rights to love, sex and affection, and also the right to freedom. This breach can bring about the issue of sodomy to prisoners, which is regarded as being immoral.
Prison system is also a disadvantage to the countrys tax payers. Some of their tax money is paid into prisons for rehabilitation of their killers, which can rather be used for any important aspect other than criminals. Most criminals commite crime out of poverty so that they can be taken to prison for free meals provided three times a day. This is a burden to the economy of the country because the inflation of basic needs prices is at its summit.
The society should rehabilitate their criminals according to the community morals. Most society are poverty striken and they should take these criminals into doing projects which will remove criminals from commiting crimes. This will be part of punishment for their crime, rehabilitation for their crimes, and another hand a benifit to the community and the criminals themselves. The prison centers should be developed and reinforced as centers for hand craft works and basic institutions for the youth who cannot afford to go into tertiary. This will prevent them from consoling into crime and being responsible citizens of the future.

TSNO1516,4.0,,,,,,Poverty is the cause of the HIV/AIDS epidemic in Africa.,"
Poverty is the cause of the HIV/AIDS epidemic in Africa, in a sense that the apedemic is caused by different factors that leads ultimately to the contraction of the disease. One of the factors contributing to this HIV/AIDS epidemic in Africa is the historical background of the continent as a whole followed by lack of education, Unemployment, lack of resourses and malnutrition.
HISTORICAL BACKGROUND OF AFRICA
Africa is the way it is today because of consequences that happened to the majority of Land owners by the White minority movement, who came and took away the identity of the (Black) Majority of people in this continent. The black people of this continent were exposed to land structures which in a way were very unfavourable to ones growth potentials. (the people were limited to live like human beings, and that has a major contribution to why children in the black communities are exposed to sex at an early age. They are exposed to such Adult activities, because you will find that in structures where blacks are made to crowd in e.g. Large numbers in a very tiny house, these children now become exposed to things like drugs and sexual activities, unlike a white child from the spacious houses where you find they have each their own bedrooms, and plays with children when it is time to play, They are not sent to buy beer/Alchohol from their neighbours.)
UNEMPLOYMENT
This is one other important factor which causes the HIV/AID epidemic to rise in this continent. In rural areas land as a source of food cultivation is overgrazed and overcultivated thus the people end up in a devastating lack of employment, because there is no enough land to sustain the multi numbers of the black cultures. African black cultures believes that for a man to show his wealth, he must show it with how many children He has or in other cases, how many women He has, but since there is no more enough food to sustain these large numbers of families, deseases come out in different dimensions because of poorvarty and lack of employment. Irresponsible drug abuse and sexual activities now take place as a source of entertainment, but not as a positive show offs of ones wealth and Power/success.
LACK OF EDUCATION
Lack of education about this epidemic is going to accelerate its growth. There are still people today who do not even understand the importance of curbing the growth of this epidemic, and they still want to live in the olden times where men could have ten wifes and still not use some protective measures. These people do not think about making plans before having a child, and the people who have more children are the poor Afican blacks who were brainwashed by the white system. People should be made aware about such Population studies and the essentiality of planning their lives, because the more children they will have, the poorer they will be, which encourages, the growth of this HIV/Deseases.
LACK OF RESOURSES.
When peopeople contract the HiV/AIDS desease it is going to be very essential that they get a prescribed medication to ease the rate/growth of the virus, which is rather expensive to maintain purchasing, and lack of affording (poor) will lead to discomfort in ones recovery which will lead to their death. People who are Poor are likely to die very quickly of the epidemic than people who are well off financially, because the poor ones will be exposed to many deseases maybe for instance malnutrition if they cannot afford the right food.
CONCLUSION
Poorverty is one of the contributing factors that caused the apedemic growth in Africa, but now is the time to take some initiation and educate the people about this problem and stop pointing fingers at one another. And people should all be empowered so that people can be able to participate in the positive growth of the generations to come and irredicate pooverty.
